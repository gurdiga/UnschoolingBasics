<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936915760">I was out mowing the lawn and thinking about all that&#39;s been written <br/>
lately. I think that there is a communication issue about  some of the <br/>
terms being tossed around.<br/>
<br/>
Several new posters have said that children need guidance, so they want <br/>
to (or DO) set limits.<br/>
<br/>
I promise our kids aren&#39;t wild monkeys because we don&#39;t set limits. <br/>
They don&#39;t strangle kittens for fun. They don&#39;t watch porno all night. <br/>
They&#39;re not shooting up in the bathroom. And yet they have &quot;unlimited&quot; <br/>
access to the world (limited only by natural limits---not arbitrary <br/>
ones).<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;re saying is that lifting limits (not all at once---just saying <br/>
&quot;yes&quot; more) and trusting our kids to make well-thought out decisions <br/>
(even though they may not be the decisions *we* would make) will ensure <br/>
that they will trust us to stand by them when they *do* have bigger <br/>
issues to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
Do my children experiment a *little* outside their comfort zones? You <br/>
bet! That&#39;s how they figure out the world. That&#39;s how they decide what <br/>
*their* personal boundaries/limits are. Still, at 11, Duncan does NOT <br/>
want to watch love/sex scenes or realistic violence.<br/>
<br/>
Do they do it without my input? No. I&#39;m there to guide and make <br/>
suggestions and help if they bite off more than they can chew. They <br/>
know I&#39;m always nearby to &quot;rescue&quot; them if they need it.<br/>
<br/>
Guidance? Maybe you think that&#39;s about keeping things from them until <br/>
you&#39;re ready to let them know about it.<br/>
<br/>
To me, it means keeping them safe from things that could be harmful <br/>
until *THEY* are ready to test their limits. How do I know when they <br/>
are ready? Because the whole world is open to them, they do it with <br/>
baby steps. They don&#39;t need to ask permission or sneak.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t watch Kill Bill when Duncan was around. He wouldn&#39;t appreciate <br/>
it. (It bothered me a bit as well!) He was a little frightened by a <br/>
couple of scenes in Lord of the Rings, but I held him close and told <br/>
him when he could open his eyes. We talked about it a lot afterwards. <br/>
If I had told him that the movie was just too intense for him, he would <br/>
have believed me because he trusts me. But if I had refused to let him <br/>
watch because *I* know better, he may have begged to watch, gone, and <br/>
gotten scared, but not want to tell me how scared he was (and lived <br/>
with that fear for days/weeks/months) OR he could have gone to see it <br/>
without me and never tell me that he saw it.<br/>
<br/>
Lying, sneaking and guilt are not good for any relationship, and since <br/>
my relationship with my boys is THE most important thing, we work <br/>
together to get what they need.<br/>
<br/>
Guidance, to me, means walking hand-in-hand while pointing out <br/>
potential problems and possible solutions. I do NOT tell him what to <br/>
do, but I&#39;m happy to tell him what *I* would do IF he asks. I&#39;m OK if <br/>
he decides on a different course---it could be a better one than I  <br/>
would have chosen. If not, I&#39;m happy to help him get out of the <br/>
uncomfortable position he&#39;s in. He knows I trust him, so he trusts me.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to have limited his world (by not allowing certain shows or <br/>
by keeping certain things &quot;secret&quot; or hidden or by not talking about <br/>
them) how would he be able to make decisions? Then I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
*guiding* him; I&#39;d be *stopping* him from exploring his world. If I <br/>
were to somehow feed him my perceptions (TV&#39;s bad, junk food&#39;s bad, <br/>
some programs/movies are bad/not worthy) that became counter to what <br/>
*HE* thinks are good or valuable, then what&#39;s a child to do? What <br/>
become his options? Lie? Sneak? Be filled wih guilt?<br/>
<br/>
If he can&#39;t trust me to trust him with small things like tv and sodas, <br/>
how do I think he will trust me with *such* bigger issues like drugs <br/>
and sex?<br/>
<br/>
Trust doesn&#39;t develop overnight. It&#39;s a process that takes years and <br/>
years and years. The earlier you start, the sooner it&#39;ll be a part of <br/>
your lives.<br/>

<br/>
Kelly what you said makes a lot of sense. But I guess I am still stuck<br/>
on some of it because my kids are so young......7 yo and 3<br/>
yo........here is another example of my setting limits.<br/>
a couple of sundays ago hubby and I were watching the Sopranos....the<br/>
kids were watching a movie of their choice in the other room......but<br/>
they decided they did not want to watch their movie they wanted to<br/>
watch the show hubby and i were watching. I said no to that because I<br/>
feel sopranos is too violent for little kids. so is that setting a <br/>
limit? Did I limit their world by not allowing them to watch the sopranos?<br/>
In reality they just wanted to watch tv with us, so we did change to<br/>
watch something else.<br/>
but bottom line they did seem interested in viewing what we were<br/>
viewing, and I did say no.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123035954">I know you asked Kelly. However, I have a suggestion<br/>
for next time. Maybe let them watch a few mintues,<br/>
maybe something where no one is getting whacked, and<br/>
them suggest watching something that you know they<br/>
would enjoy? I know that mostly my son just wants to<br/>
be with us, that it&#39;s not about what&#39;s on. He used to<br/>
enjoy scary movies with me. (I think they are funny).<br/>
But know he has decided that some are just too scary. <br/>
Just take baby steps. Giant leaps are not good for or<br/>
your kids. Instead of quickly stating no, think and<br/>
hopefully you can find a good reason to say yes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-101647373">~~...but<br/>
they decided they did not want to watch their movie they wanted to<br/>

limit? ~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rather than saying &quot;no&quot;, just be open to the moment. Did they really<br/>
want to watch it anyway, or simply BE with you? If being with Mum and<br/>
Dad was the object, then saying &quot;let&#39;s find a show we all like&quot; would<br/>
be a great tactic rather than saying &quot;you can&#39;t watch this&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There have been times that dh and I were watching something we knew a<br/>
child wasn&#39;t able to handle, so we simply stopped it and said &quot;I think<br/>
this show will really bother you, let&#39;s watch something we all like&quot;<br/>
and that was  fine.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about exposing your kids to anything and everything, I think<br/>
young children should be shown books/shows/ etc...that are more tame.<br/>
But I&#39;ve also learned that some young children like Alien vs. Predator<br/>
and other things I would have deemed to violent.<br/>
<br/>
Jalen likes some pretty freaky shows, and has NO ill effect from it.<br/>
His older sister was very sensitive for a long time and is now<br/>
beginning to like some scary movies at age 10. Each of my kids are so<br/>
different in regard to their preferences. I&#39;d never learn that if I<br/>
was more bent on limiting, than expanding.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor really wants me to watch &quot;Saw&quot; and &quot;Saw 2&quot;. NO WAY. I don&#39;t<br/>
care for outright horror most of the time now...just can&#39;t handle some<br/>
of it. He loves those movies and would enjoy discussing it with me<br/>
because it&#39;s intelligent horror that puts the characters in some<br/>
bizarre catch 22&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
They all love anime. Some of that is pretty dark, but the discussions<br/>
spawned from that are amazing.<br/>
<br/>
The key isn&#39;t about exposing kids to anything they aren&#39;t ready for.<br/>
The key is IF the child is fascinated, how are you going to find a way<br/>
to help them navigate?  How are you going to help them get what they<br/>
want (and how is everyone in the situation going to get what they need<br/>
out of it)?  How can we expand their worlds?<br/>
<br/>
They may watch something they aren&#39;t ready for, because of a<br/>
fascination. Are we there for them without being ready to slam a limit<br/>
on them for the next time, shouting that we don&#39;t trust them now<br/>
because they made a mistake? Are we willing and able to let them make<br/>
mistakes and still trust them? Can we quit relying on limits as the<br/>
fix-all? Because it might be a bandage in the moment, making the<br/>
parents feel better. Hell, a limit is sure easier than truly being a<br/>
guide.<br/>
<br/>
But the effort it takes to be there for them, to dialogue, to support,<br/>
to navigate is so much healthier than slapping a limit on something<br/>
just because it causes some discomfort. <br/>
<br/>
The question I ask myself often is &quot;how can everyone get what they<br/>
want from this?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The point, as you did, is to get to what the kids *really* want,  <br/>
which was to be with you. And turning it off was the right solution.<br/>
<br/>
But the initial no, it&#39;s too violent has increased the curiosity  <br/>
factor, and a desire beyond the initial curiosity. A plain door isn&#39;t  <br/>
any where near as intriguing as a door with a big read &quot;DO NOT ENTER&quot;  <br/>
sign on it!<br/>
<br/>
By saying no, it&#39;s too violent, you&#39;re saying in essence -- basically  <br/>
what they internalize that you&#39;re saying to them -- &quot;I don&#39;t trust  <br/>
your ability to handle this.&quot; It might be true that they aren&#39;t ready  <br/>
for the violence, but by saying you don&#39;t trust their ability, it  <br/>
becomes an internal challenge to test that limit.<br/>
<br/>
Picture Uncle John at the family reunion saying to the kids &quot;That  <br/>
rock&#39;s too high. You can&#39;t jump off of it,&quot; with the expectation that  <br/>
the kids *will* jump off the rock. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the state of mind &quot;No&quot; creates. &quot;No&quot; is a personal challenge!  <br/>
It&#39;s natural to want to test our personal limits. Especially limits  <br/>
others doubt we&#39;re up to. Especially with kids who know they&#39;re  <br/>
growing and changing everyday. What they couldn&#39;t do last week they  <br/>
know it&#39;s possible they can do today.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of no, mindful parents will give information: &quot;Sopranos is  <br/>
very violent. There&#39;s a lot of killing and people being mean to each  <br/>
other. If you&#39;d like to watch, we can try it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A child who has been hearing no *won&#39;t* hear that information in the  <br/>
same way as a child who trusts that his parent is working to get them  <br/>
what they want. A child who has heard no will hear what they&#39;ve  <br/>
always heard: &quot;No, I don&#39;t trust you can handle it.&quot; It takes time to  <br/>
build up trust that a parent really is trying to help them.<br/>
<br/>
For a child who has been mindfully parented, they *know* their  <br/>
parents want to help them get what they want. If a parent says  <br/>
something is violent, it&#39;s a piece of information to *help* them  <br/>
decide. They *trust* the parent understands what bothers them  <br/>
personally (for my daughter it was moving skeletons) and the  <br/>
information is tailored specifically to them. But they also know that  <br/>
their limits are always changing. (My daughter can watch movies with  <br/>
moving skeletons now.) If they decide to watch they know they can  <br/>
turn it off at any time, they know they pick it up again later when  <br/>
they feel ready, they know if they have nightmares from watching that  <br/>
their parents will comfort them. They *trust* that their parents are  <br/>
their partners in getting what they want from life so they trust  <br/>
information is to help them not to put up barriers around them.<br/>

 <br/>
I guess if it were me I would also talk to my children.  Before  watching it. <br/>
 If they came into the room, and I have done this with my boys  before, I <br/>
pause the movie, or change the channel.  And we talk, what is it  that they <br/>
want...to be with mom and dad...to watch what we are watching...to  watch something <br/>
together not necessarily what we are watching...something  totally <br/>
different....etc.  And if they want to watch what we are watching,  I will explain what <br/>
we are watching to them, not in gory detail.  I  will explain that the <br/>
violence and blood may be something they are not  comfortable with.  I might try to <br/>
compare it to something they have watched  prior saying &quot;it is more than XYZ or <br/>
less than ABC etc).  I would help  provide all the information available so <br/>
they can make a good informed  decision.  I don&#39;t try to decide for them but do <br/>
feel that, as someone who  loves them very much, I want to help them gather <br/>
as much information as they  need to be able to make decisions.  And they do <br/>
ask my opinion.  They  trust me.  They will say something like &quot;mom do you think <br/>
I would like  it?&quot;  or something like that.  They know I will give them an <br/>
honest  answer.  My youngest is always there for me too.  He knows that I  don&#39;t <br/>
like bloody, gory movies, so he knows when to cover my eyes, LOL.   And I do <br/>
the same for him.  He&#39;ll say &quot;don&#39;t peek mom...I&#39;ll tell you when  it is <br/>
over.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
I think when you build that great relationship you can do that for each  <br/>
other and no one feels &quot;controlled&quot;.  You have built that trust.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, I think &quot;No,&quot; interferes with learning and relationships far  <br/>
more than lack of TV.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest miscommunication in these discussions about TV is  <br/>
that the anti-TV people think we&#39;re holding TV up as a bastion of  <br/>
learning when we&#39;re really discussing the effect of parent imposed  <br/>
limits on learning and relationships, and about holding fears up to  <br/>
close examination.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think a child will be harmed by not having TV. But I think  <br/>
the relationship between parent and child *will* be harmed by a  <br/>
parent saying no to something a child is interested in. At some point  <br/>
children will see TV and realize that it&#39;s something their family  <br/>
*could* have and every no the parent says -- even when those nos are  <br/>
heart felt rational explanations of why the parent thinks TV isn&#39;t a  <br/>
good thing for their family -- whittles away at the relationship  <br/>
between parent and child.<br/>
<br/>
But even further, if the no stands between the child and something  <br/>
they&#39;re really interested in, the only options the parent is giving  <br/>
the child is to keep battering at the no or to sneak behind the  <br/>
parent&#39;s back. That, too, is not good for the relationship. (Though  <br/>
the child might be learning a lot about how to get around rules! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At some point when the children are<br/>
&gt; older and inevitably ask for a TV<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t yet taken my daughter to a tractor pull but if she asked  <br/>
we&#39;d go.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the same atmosphere as me fearing the effects of tractor  <br/>
pulls and hoping she doesn&#39;t ever ask but *saying* if she ever asks  <br/>
that I&#39;d take her.<br/>
<br/>
Your fears, even unspoken, will affect the atmosphere of the home and  <br/>
will affect your children&#39;s freedom to ask. You can&#39;t not live your  <br/>
life with the fears you have towards TV -- it might be as subtle as a  <br/>
stiffening of your body when you hear a mother relate how her 4 yo  <br/>
loves the news -- and not communicate that you have fears to your  <br/>
kids. They won&#39;t feel as free to ask for TV as they might a book or a  <br/>
toy.<br/>
<br/>
So it isn&#39;t the lack of TV that will elicit discussion but your  <br/>
*reasons* for not having a TV. It&#39;s your fears and your decision to  <br/>
soothe them rather than examine them in the light of facts that will  <br/>
elicit discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I tossed out my aluminum cookware when I heard aluminum might be a  <br/>
cause of Alzheimers. Might. It was just a fear I chose to soothe  <br/>
rather than take a chance on. No big deal. It was my decision that  <br/>
affected me.<br/>
<br/>
But your fear is affecting the atmosphere you&#39;re creating for your  <br/>
kids. They *can&#39;t* feel as free around TV with that huge fear in you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; maybe the<br/>
&gt; effects of watching the violence won&#39;t be quite as harsh as it<br/>
&gt; would&#39;ve been for a three year old.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you asked yourself why you watched so much news when it upset  <br/>
you? Did you watch because you wanted to be with your mom? How much  <br/>
did she understand that it upset you? If she didn&#39;t, why didn&#39;t she?  <br/>
What did she do to help you with your fears? If she knew and didn&#39;t  <br/>
do anything, why didn&#39;t she? If she knew and was ineffectual, why was  <br/>
she?<br/>
<br/>
This fear is unfounded in a mindful home. While it&#39;s impossible to  <br/>
prevent a sensitive child from accidently seeing something that will  <br/>
upset them -- whether on TV or in real life -- when we&#39;re sensitive  <br/>
to what our kids want, we won&#39;t be helping them find things  that  <br/>
will upset them. At 15 my daughter has probably never seen the news.  <br/>
She&#39;s seen ads for it. She&#39;s seen parodies of it. She just as *zero*  <br/>
interest in news.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that she&#39;s never seen or heard or read something upsetting  <br/>
but I recognize that&#39;s inevitable and we handle it as it happens.  <br/>
Dealing with things that upset us is part of life.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you fear your 3 yo will see things that will upset her? Is she  <br/>
particularly sensitive so that even Disney movies or a commercial  <br/>
might upset her? (There are several people on the list with very  <br/>
sensitive children who can give you some strategies that have worked  <br/>
for them.) Or are you projecting your own childhood onto someone who  <br/>
isn&#39;t you?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Even if we discuss it with them<br/>
&gt; the images have been burned into their minds, we can&#39;t fix that or<br/>
&gt; take that away. Doesn&#39;t this seem valid?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, we can&#39;t erase something.<br/>
<br/>
But put it this way: If your child saw -- in real life -- a dog hit  <br/>
by a car, you&#39;d be able to help him a lot better from a mindset of  <br/>
peace and calm that tragedy and being upset is a part of life than if  <br/>
you&#39;d structured your life around the fear that he might see a dog  <br/>
hit by a car so lived your life far from streets and dogs and cars  <br/>
and then had a head full of additional fears that this event had  <br/>
traumatized him for life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sure don&#39;t refuse it, but<br/>
&gt; why offer it up in the first place if we think it may have ill<br/>
&gt; effects?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The key phrase above is &quot;*think* it may have ill effects&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think it will help you to examine even further what happened to you  <br/>
as a child. There was some disconnection that kept you seeing things  <br/>
that were harming you. You could have turned it off. Your mother  <br/>
could have turned it off. But something in your home life kept you  <br/>
watching. It wasn&#39;t the TV, but you&#39;ve chosen to blame the TV. It&#39;s  <br/>
easier to blame the TV than to dig further. It&#39;s easier to ban TV  <br/>
than to take what *feels* like risks (but, from experience with  <br/>
mindfully parented unschooled kids we&#39;ve shown you plenty of counter  <br/>
examples.)<br/>
<br/>
I think your husband too is cutting off the discussion because of  <br/>
fears. It&#39;s much easier to ease a fear than face it. He has grasped  <br/>
at the easy solution of getting rid of TV because he fears the  <br/>
effects. It&#39;s a lot harder to drag those fears out and examine them  <br/>
against what really happens with kids who are given freedom.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why not just rid ourselves of the television? Is it because<br/>
&gt; as adults we don&#39;t want to  give it up?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why give up something that *we* know from experience isn&#39;t harmful? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think if you had read on the list long you wouldn&#39;t ask whether  <br/>
people are making unexamined decisions about their kids. ;-) There  <br/>
isn&#39;t a practice with kids that hasn&#39;t been held up and examined and  <br/>
looked at rationally in the light of real experience with real  <br/>
unschooled kids. It&#39;s what the writers on the list love to do. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If that is the case are we<br/>
&gt; then being mindful to our children&#39;s needs?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s always a good question to ask! It&#39;s always good to dig deep and  <br/>
examine our motives behind our choices, especially choices that  <br/>
affect our kids.<br/>
<br/>
But your question comes from the point of view that TV is harmful.  <br/>
What we&#39;re asking you to examine is what were the causes behind what  <br/>
happened to you? We have kids who have the freedom to watch whatever  <br/>
they want and the same thing hasn&#39;t happened to them. Why? With the  <br/>
same factor (TV) the outcome is different so it can&#39;t be the TV.  <br/>
You&#39;re comparing your life and our lives but there&#39;s some *other*  <br/>
factor that&#39;s caused the different outcomes. *That&#39;s* what you need  <br/>
to examine.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Please someone tell me<br/>
&gt; that I&#39;m being mindful of my child&#39;s needs and that I didn&#39;t sell my<br/>
&gt; TV and episodes of The Golden Girls that I had on DVD for no reason!:)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was a reason that made sense at the time! If you weren&#39;t watching  <br/>
and pictured yourself not ever watching then it made sense.<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;re always growing and changing and decisions that made sense  <br/>
for the person we used to be won&#39;t necessarily make sense now.<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, used copies of The Golden Girls seasons go for about $25 on  <br/>
Amazon :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114231331">~~At some point when the children are<br/>
older and inevitably ask for a TV and they see this show maybe the<br/>
effects of watching the violence won&#39;t be quite as harsh as it<br/>
would&#39;ve been for a three year old. ~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, maybe not. I still think you&#39;re giving those images too much<br/>
power.  And I doubt a three year old would ever see those violent<br/>
images because you&#39;d probably have &quot;Blues Clues&quot; and other sweet shows<br/>
on when they wanted to watch, right?:)<br/>
<br/>
THe issue really isn&#39;t about whether you have a tv or not. But if you<br/>
said the exact same thing about books &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be better to just<br/>
not have them in the house until they ask for them?&quot; does it sound the<br/>
same? Worse? Better?<br/>
<br/>
Limiting a form of communication out of fear may not be the best<br/>
reason for not having one. Viewing tv as potentially harmful is not<br/>
only fear-based, but inaccurate. It&#39;s just a box that when turned on,<br/>
has information we choose to access. That&#39;s all. Just like a book, or<br/>
a radio.<br/>
<br/>
I think the way a parent handles images viewed, has a greater effect<br/>
than the images themselves. If a child DOES see something before<br/>
they&#39;re ready, the parent has an opportunity to calmly support,<br/>
explain tv/movie effects and not be overreactive. <br/>
<br/>
What if your child saw real-life violence? How are you going to censor<br/>
that?  What if they watched an animal or a person get hit by a car? My<br/>
children were with me immediately following a pedestrian accident<br/>
where the woman was unconsicous laying in the street. I stopped to<br/>
help. By stopping to assist, they were given full view of everything.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being very upset on occasions as a child because my Dad<br/>
always stopped to help at car wrecks (he had training and always<br/>
carried certain emergency items with us, including army blankets) and<br/>
I saw some things that were pretty intense for a young child. The<br/>
manner in which my parents handled it really helped me. Real life<br/>
violence always affected me on a much deeper level than anything a tv<br/>
could offer up!! I knew it was REAL. <br/>
<br/>
My upsetness was a process of dealing with real people being injured<br/>
(and one time transporting injured people due to the nature of<br/>
emergency help in remote locations in Alaska) and how to cope with<br/>
that. I&#39;d say it was a very positive experience in my life, though it<br/>
was sometimes scary to see a car on fire, or injured people etc...<br/>
<br/>
TV just can&#39;t come close to that in my mind!  After seeing injured<br/>
people, it stays with me. Tv is just entertainment or<br/>
information...big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that everyone has a different level of sensitivity and tv<br/>
will affect others, where it isn&#39;t affecting me. I just don&#39;t see how<br/>
a tv image can have this horrible life-long impact if the  parents are<br/>
 being supportive and assisting their children in having their needs met.<br/>
<br/>
I also work in a business where we learn about movie/tv effects and<br/>
study that. My kids see magazines that show how to create realistic<br/>
zombies and injuries and what-not. How to make a believable scene or<br/>
special effect is a common topic of discussion. I think knowing all<br/>
that behind-the-scenes information gives the violent or intense scenes<br/>
a lot less power.<br/>

I&#39;m trying to remember that I am not my mother. For that matter my<br/>
daughter & son are not me. What had adverse effects on me, may not be<br/>
the same for them. I see that, or at least I&#39;m trying to.~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think your self-analysis has really extracted the crux of this<br/>
entire issue (for you).....it wasn&#39;t about the tv at all. The true<br/>
hurt came from a  parent that wasn&#39;t truly there for you. It got all<br/>
linked in with the tv, because of it&#39;s presence, but the real damage<br/>
came from a negligent parent (that was probably doing the best she<br/>
could at the time).<br/>
<br/>
What if your Mum had used the TV as a time to bond with YOU? What if<br/>
she had smiled and looked happy when you entered the room? What if<br/>
she&#39;d said &quot;what do you want to watch?&quot; or offered up a million other<br/>
options, or simply chosen to be with YOU in whatever activity you felt<br/>
like exploring? What if she&#39;d dug in the dirt and had water fights and<br/>
made art and taken walks (just to be with you) and generally embraced<br/>
you as the beautiful person you are? What kind of feelings might you<br/>
have about tv in that instance?<br/>
<br/>
Your mother had the true power, not the tv. I&#39;m really sorry the<br/>
negative feelings got all wrapped up in that package. It&#39;s great that<br/>
you&#39;ve been able to analyze the truth of the situation and see it for<br/>
what it really is. That&#39;s hard to do.<br/>
<br/>
If tv is just one option among many and a parent is walking the path<br/>
of mindfulness and joy, it isn&#39;t going to be a harmful influence at<br/>
all. In fact, it will expand the learning and connecting experiences<br/>
within that family.<br/>

&gt; Because of my experience a TV does equal mindless parenting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, I grew up in a house like that, too. There were times in my  <br/>
house when my parents, my brother, and I were all watching the same  <br/>
TV show--on three different TVs in three different bedrooms. Because  <br/>
of that, I had a really hard time agreeing when my partner suggested  <br/>
we get a second TV, or that we move a TV into the kids&#39; room from our  <br/>
room because they were the only ones who ever watched it. In our  <br/>
house now, getting a second TV was a step to increase our choices and  <br/>
reduce conflicts. I like to relax by watching DVDs, and David and the  <br/>
kids are playing video games together a lot in the evening, and with  <br/>
one TV we were having trouble all getting to do what we wanted. But I  <br/>
still have moments--if the kids are watching Blue&#39;s Clues on their TV  <br/>
and I&#39;m watching something on the TV in the living room--when I think  <br/>
we&#39;re on the slippery slope to being the house I grew up in, even  <br/>
though a lot of other things would have to happen for us to get  <br/>
there. I would have to stop liking my children, for instance, and  <br/>
stop caring about what they want and give no thought or attention to  <br/>
their emotional well-being. That&#39;s not likely!<br/>
<br/>
In the house I grew up in--and it sounds like in the one you grew up  <br/>
in as well--TV was used to avoid reality, to pacify otherwise  <br/>
bothersome children, and to help us avoid the fights that happened  <br/>
whenever we spent more than a few minutes together. In my house now,  <br/>
we use it to relax; to be entertained; to learn; for my five-year- <br/>
old, to have some non-napping down time. We use it for family  <br/>
togetherness.<br/>
<br/>
Because of how I grew up, and because of one period in my young adult  <br/>
life when I was isolated and depressed (after moving cross-country to  <br/>
be with a lover, only to get dumped upon arrival) and watched endless  <br/>
TV--I felt so addicted to it at that time that I eventually packed it  <br/>
away in my closet--all the anti-TV arguments really resonated with me  <br/>
for a long time. But I have come to see that TV serves dysfunction in  <br/>
a dysfunctional family. It was dysfunctional for me during a  <br/>
dysfunctional time in my life. But it doesn&#39;t have so much power that  <br/>
it can turn a functional, happy family into a dysfunctional one, or  <br/>
turn a cheerful, happy me into a depressed, addicted me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-792611676">I&#39;m going to take some deep breaths and chime in here.<br/>
<br/>
My example of  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the park was to show that the TV is just one more I do to try and  <br/>
&gt; continually control my and therefore my children&#39;s environment. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; all goes together I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling happens slowly.  It&#39;s a series of steps -- mostly made <br/>
up of parents letting go of controls.  I continue to have issues <br/>
with TV and sugar.  Since the topic here is TV, I&#39;ll focus on that.  <br/>
My kids have unlimited access to movies and videos.  They have their <br/>
own Netflix profile.  We get movies from the library and the video <br/>
store.  They watch things on Youtube.  They have unlimited access to <br/>
computer and video games.  But we don&#39;t have cable which means we <br/>
get almost no television reception.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true there is a book out there to support any side of any <br/>
issue.  There seems to be a whole segment of unschoolers (outside of <br/>
this list) who support no tv.  It&#39;s an interesting subject - one <br/>
that has been talked to death here and on other lists.  And one that <br/>
ties me in knots.  Even Naomi Aldort advocates no TV.  But I know <br/>
people who grew up without TV and they really resent it.  I also <br/>
know my neighbor (who is 9) feels a bit like Matilda from Roald <br/>
Dahl&#39;s book because her mom keeps the tv on all the time.  But both <br/>
of those extremes have to do with adult-centered, top down control, <br/>
not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Within unschooling, I can see both sides of to have tv or not.  How <br/>
do you justify not having tv in a free house where we want our <br/>
children to have access to every part of our lives?  But on the <br/>
other hand, it seems that electronic media becomes the eyepiece <br/>
through which kids perceive the world.  And that doesn&#39;t seem real.  <br/>
We say that schools are constructs that separate children from the <br/>
real world.  Teachers even say that. &quot;When you get in the real <br/>
world, you won&#39;t be able to get away with that.&quot;  But how real is 8 <br/>
hours of Nickelodeon a day?  I think tv is different than a book.  <br/>
It can be so dazzling and stimulating, that books are no contest.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have seen all of their Nick shows.  Some days they watch a <br/>
lot of videos and movies, other days they don&#39;t.  They are far more <br/>
interested in books and playing outside than when we had cable.  <br/>
Maybe the problem was the commercials and always something new <br/>
coming up next.  They can still watch what they want to watch, but <br/>
they are not tied to the tv schedule.  I know that the problems we <br/>
had with tv - crankiness, fighting, shutting me out - were partly <br/>
caused by my issues with tv.  But knowing that didn&#39;t change my <br/>
axieties about it.  Perhaps I am still in the process of letting go <br/>
control.<br/>

When Dylan was little we were at homeschool park day and he saw his friend <br/>

When he watched fake monsters stomp model trains on TV that wasn&#39;t violence. <br/>

I&#39;ve known moms who were afraid of TV violence (as if that&#39;s a real thing), <br/>
afraid it would harm their kids, but who yanked their kid arms, or spanked <br/>
or swatted their kids or who yelled and took away their kids possessions. <br/>
That&#39;s a wagon load of real life violence more powerful than any TV show.<br/>

<br/>
a couple of sundays ago hubby and I were watching the Sopranos....the<br/>
kids were watching a movie of their choice in the other room......but<br/>
they decided they did not want to watch their movie they wanted to<br/>
watch the show hubby and i were watching. I said no to that because I<br/>
feel sopranos is too violent for little kids. so is that setting a<br/>
limit? Did I limit their world by not allowing them to watch the <br/>
sopranos?<br/>
In reality they just wanted to watch tv with us, so we did change to<br/>
watch something else.<br/>
but bottom line they did seem interested in viewing what we were<br/>
viewing, and I did say no.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
To clarify: the kids didn&#39;t really want to watch The Sopranos. They <br/>
wanted to watch TV with you and your husband. They would watch The <br/>
Sopranos if that were their only option. It wasn&#39;t: you gave the a <br/>
better option by changing the channel and watching something you could <br/>
all enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
So, did you say &quot;no&quot; or did you say &quot;yes&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Can you see the difference?<br/>

<br/>
By not having a television the subject of violence or sex or<br/>
whatever it may be that my child might be exposed to doesn&#39;t come up.<br/>
Therefore eliminating any discussions or questions that I feel I may<br/>
not be prepared to answer or that may take me out of my comfort zone.<br/>
Still I wanted to ponder the following...<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s  one the COOLEST things about TV. Sitcoms and these &quot;edgy&quot; <br/>
cartoons especially!<br/>
<br/>
They bring up touchy words and subjects that really DON&#39;T come up in <br/>
every day conversations! It&#39;s an opening to explain how *I* view that <br/>
word or situation or subject. Or to clarify what *they* think about it. <br/>
ANd to see how they change (like going from &quot;kissing is yucky&quot; at eight <br/>
to &quot;why is she licking him?&quot; at eleven to &quot;Mom, what kinds of <br/>
contraception have you used?&quot; at 17) &lt;g&gt; Things change! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Watching TV and movies together make it really easy to eeaasseee into <br/>
difficult discussions like sex and drinking and drugs and suicide and <br/>
tons of other subjects that really don&#39;t get brought up during supper. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I wouldn&#39;t simply  say no. However, with young<br/>
children, especially, wouldn&#39;t it just be better not to have the TV<br/>
in the house in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
No---see my previous post: the Sleeping Beauty example.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 At some point when the children are<br/>
older and inevitably ask for a TV and they see this show maybe the<br/>
effects of watching the violence won&#39;t be quite as harsh as it<br/>
would&#39;ve been for a three year old.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Really, how often does a child see violence portrayed on TV at three <br/>
year old? Blues Clues and Dora don&#39;t get too violent!<br/>
<br/>
Why would someone be watching Kill Bill with a three year old in the <br/>
room??? Why would someone watch the news with a three year old in the <br/>
room? Seriously! Do any of you DO that? Would you?<br/>
<br/>
The thing I&#39;d be worried about in wihholding and then giving tv access <br/>
is that the older child would be fascinated for an extended period of <br/>
time and make all your predictions come true.<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Even if we discuss it with them<br/>
the images have been burned into their minds, we can&#39;t fix that or<br/>
take that away. Doesn&#39;t this seem valid?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Helping a child DEAL with difficult images is sooo much more important <br/>
than keeping ALL negative things from the child. He *will* see bad <br/>
stuff. Knowing how to work through it and talk or act it out and <br/>
knowing that mom is willing to help him through a difficult spot is so <br/>
much more helpful than just closing his eyes to all &quot;danger&quot; and hoping <br/>
that he never has to see it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Sure don&#39;t refuse it, but why offer it up in the first place if we <br/>
think it may have ill<br/>
effects?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, *I* don&#39;t think it *will* have ill effects. So it&#39;s there. Right <br/>
now at 11:00pm, my husband&#39;s asleep. I&#39;m TiVoing Law & Order, my 19 <br/>
year old is out with friends (probably listening to live Blue Grass), <br/>
and my 11 year old is lying on the trampoline with a friend looking at <br/>
the stars and talking. No TV. By choice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why not just rid ourselves of the television?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t want to. It brings joy and opportunities and fun and cool places, <br/>
people, and animals into our living room. For pennies/day!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it because as adults we don&#39;t want to give it up?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one reason. And since the adults are the omnipotent beings in <br/>
this society, we have the power to keep it or trash it.<br/>
<br/>
The children usually have no say. So only the adults can decide.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If that is the case are we then being mindful to our children&#39;s needs?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I try to be. That&#39;s a big part of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Please someone tell me<br/>
that I&#39;m being mindful of my child&#39;s needs and that I didn&#39;t sell my<br/>
TV and episodes of The Golden Girls that I had on DVD for no reason!:)<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
BUNCH of violence on Golden Girls! Don&#39;t want the kids to see THAT <br/>
violent stuff! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

    I don&#39;t remember exactly how I said it, but I did say no sopranos is <br/>
not a kids<br/>
show, and we did find a movie everyone was happy to watch together.  <br/>
But maybe I<br/>
did peak their curiosity because sometimes they say &quot;is sopranos on<br/>
tonight&quot;...........:(<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you asked them why they&#39;re asking?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they think it&#39;s something *really* cool because it&#39;s being &quot;kept&quot; <br/>
 from them (adults do that a lot---sex, drinking, etc., so it just makes <br/>
it more attractive). Things that are labled &quot;adult&quot; become incredibly <br/>
sought after. I&#39;d avoid that term, &quot;not a kids&#39; show&quot; or &quot;for adults <br/>
only&quot;---just makes it too &quot;sparkly&quot;! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Could be that they want to know whether you will be spending the <br/>
evening watching TV without them. Could be that they want to talk you <br/>
into another movie that you *all* will watch.<br/>
<br/>
Ask them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693464812">~~Not that being a mindful parent isn&#39;t work but working with<br/>
your children rather than against them is much different.~~<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely!! It is both a difficult journey and also immensely easier.<br/>
Because you&#39;re right, it&#39;s easier to work with a child&#39;s natural<br/>
interests, fascinations and personalities rather than trying to change<br/>
them. It&#39;s easier in life to work with nature, to go with what IS<br/>
instead of fighting against things. <br/>
<br/>
But because of the way most of us were raised, it can also be a<br/>
difficult mindset to embrace. I am constantly having my eyes opened to<br/>
areas where I can be more creative, more flexible and have deeper<br/>
understanding. <br/>
<br/>
I loved reading about you and your dh&#39;s joy in re-discovering<br/>
tv/movies. How cool is that? When I feel fearful about something I<br/>
really try to evaluate what that message is really about. There are SO<br/>
many ways our lives have opened up and joy seeped in because we can<br/>
let things flow.<br/>
<br/>
Keep us posted on all the wonderful learning and joy that happens with<br/>
tv and movies.:) I&#39;ll be interested in hearing all about it!<br/>

I&#39;ve known moms who were afraid of TV violence (as if that&#39;s a real thing), <br/>
afraid it would harm their kids, but who yanked their kid arms, or spanked <br/>
or swatted their kids or who yelled and took away their kids possessions. <br/>
That&#39;s a wagon load of real life violence more powerful than any TV show.<br/>

I think people who desire to always impose their will on others have a <br/>
problem, alright.<br/>
But I don&#39;t think every communication of disagreement between people is <br/>
violence.<br/>
I don&#39;t think someone saying &quot;I have a better idea lets do it this way.&quot; is <br/>
anything like having one&#39;s face beat bloody. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If someone was getting punched and I thought I could stop it,  I&#39;d <br/>
definitely impose my will on the hitter.  I have stopped people who were <br/>
hassling Dylan about school subjects.    When Dylan was little I&#39;d stop him <br/>
if he was infringing on the rights of others.<br/>
