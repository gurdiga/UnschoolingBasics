<div id="ygrps-yiv-28710331">We were at dinner tonight and got talking about the Peabody <br/>
Conference, how much dh enjoyed meeting the &quot;guys&quot; and how he had <br/>
been hesitant to go, not knowing what to expect etc.  He&#39;s had some <br/>
time to process it, and has been reading on Ben&#39;s SSUDS group.  He <br/>
told about some of the guys he met in the dads group, and how maybe <br/>
we can try to hook up with people when we&#39;re camping (or plan our <br/>
camping trips around visiting people eventually).  Then he talked <br/>
about how so many of the people we know (&quot;old&quot; friends, not <br/>
unschoolers), people we hardly ever see, people we thought were <br/>
friends have been so hard to get together with.  It seems that WE&#39;RE <br/>
always the ones making the effort.   I said, well we&#39;ve got a who <br/>
bunch of NEW unschooler friends all over the country (and the world <br/>
for that matter!) and if you want to meet them in one place, the L&L <br/>
Conference is in NM in Sep.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I about fell off my chair when he said &quot;sure, why not!   We <br/>
could do that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was SO excited, but.....my dd does NOT want to go.  We were in a <br/>
restaurant, so I couldn&#39;t really have a meaningful conversation with <br/>
her about it, but I WILL later on when we can have some quiet time <br/>
together.   I&#39;m trying not to be upset, but inside, I&#39;ll admit, I <br/>
AM.   Part of me is saying, &quot;hey!  That&#39;s the WHOLE POINT of pulling <br/>
you out of school, and deschooling, healing, trying to live a joyful <br/>
life&quot; etc, but I don&#39;t think she has any concept at all of <br/>
the &quot;living a joyful unschooling life&quot; that I see as what I want for <br/>
our family!   Yes, if we had ALWAYS lived this way, it would be <br/>
second nature or not even an issue, but it&#39;s still foreign to her.   <br/>
Also, she&#39;s an introvert, hates transitions and new places etc.  <br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m SO happy, but also VERY discouraged at the same time.   Any <br/>
words of wisdom to help me put this in perspective and address it in <br/>
a meaningful way when we&#39;re able to talk about it?<br/>
