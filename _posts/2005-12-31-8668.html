<br/>
State laws and state and local group contacts (for the best information<br/>
about local laws) available at www.nhen.org .<br/>
<br/>
My first thought is just not to resume anything after your holiday break.<br/>
Just declare to her an extended holiday for now. Get legal per your State,<br/>
and then withdraw from your charter school as if you were simply changing<br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
Put your curriculum materials on the same shelf as the coloring books and<br/>
then start having fun playing with your dd all day while you read all you<br/>
can on this list, www.sandradodd.com/unschooling and www.unschooling.info<br/>
and the related links.<br/>
<br/>
What State are you in?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ohio is one of the more problematic states for unschooling because  <br/>
you have to deal directly with a local school district. That makes it  <br/>
imperative to get in touch with people local to you and find out what  <br/>
they&#39;ve done that has been deemed satisfactory. There are two  <br/>
documents that might be useful to you - &quot;An Unschoolers Course of  <br/>
Study&quot; was written by an unschooler in Ohio - and I used hers and  <br/>
expanded on it even more. They are both here on Sandra Dodd&#39;s  <br/>
website: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a>&gt;.<br/>
