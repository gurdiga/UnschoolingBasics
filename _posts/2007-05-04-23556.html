<div id="ygrps-yiv-275340581">as  much as i would like to think that I don&#39;t care what others think of <br/>
me...I truly do to a certain extent. I know that my children like to do <br/>
certain things at home such as running in circles around the house and <br/>
making loud animal noises and such. However, having worked in a restaraunt <br/>
myself (many many times unfortunately) I can say this....waiters and <br/>
waitresses DESPISE having to clean up salt, pepper, packets of sugar,etc off <br/>
of a table. They also hate it when kids run around in a restaurant <br/>
unsupervised while the parents are totally oblivious to what their kids are <br/>
doing. I know that you&#39;re all new to this and trust me, I&#39;m a mom.It&#39;s the <br/>
toughest job in the world. Do yourself a favor though and give your son some <br/>
structure. I&#39;m a free spirit and believe in unschooling and the freedom to <br/>
learn but the behaviour in the restaurant is something that should be <br/>
avoided. Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-297288614">Take a deep breath- it is ok for your kids to do things within <br/>
reason that may bother you and others but IS okay. Sometimes I tell <br/>
my 4 yr old that certain things (talking about burping, farting) are <br/>
acceptable with our family but not in fornt of others. Other things <br/>
like wanting a plate for each food and silverwear is okay and if not <br/>
overboard than just shrug and give a quick explaination such as - he <br/>
does not want his food to touch and that includes the forks. Others <br/>
may not agree with you allowing him to do this but it seems <br/>
reasonable to him. hang in there. Julie<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are, however, ways to facilitate children&#39;s exploration in <br/>
ways that aren&#39;t a terrible inconvenience to others. One is to take <br/>
children to &quot;family&quot; restaurants, where a certain amount of kid-mess <br/>
is anticipated and/or expect to do a certain amount of clean-up at <br/>
the end of the meal. And tip well. Buffet-style resaurants would be <br/>
a good option for the child in the OP - he can take as many <br/>
plates/silverware as he needs without going into &quot;employee space&quot;. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; doing. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling isn&#39;t about being &quot;totally oblivious to what...kids are <br/>
doing,&quot; though. Its about being engaged with and responsive to our <br/>
childrens&#39; needs and passions. I always expect to do a certain <br/>
amount of exploring at a restaurant *with* my younger child. That <br/>
way I can help her stay out of the way of employees, while answering <br/>
her questions and pointing out items of interest. <br/>
<br/>
On the few occasions we&#39;ve gone to fancier restaurants with <br/>
relatives we&#39;ve called ahead and explained that we&#39;ll be dining with <br/>
a young child - do they have a more secluded table, out of the flow <br/>
of traffic so we can bring a few toys to keep her occupied? <br/>
Restaurants meals can be dull for children, so being proactive helps <br/>
things go more smoothly for everyone (kid, parents, staff).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do yourself a favor though and give your son some <br/>
&gt; structure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The good news with unschooling is that chaos and structure are not <br/>
the only options. I&#39;ve found it most helpful, wrt finding other <br/>
options, to change my expectations about resaurant eating. Its not <br/>
going to be the same with a younger child as it is with a group of <br/>
adults. *I&#39;m* not going to be able to kick back and let someone else <br/>
do all the work - I&#39;ll be helping my kid understand the environment, <br/>
an understanding that includes the needs of the wait-staff. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know the feeling. I&#39;ve *mostly* gotten over it in public, but this <br/>
last fall we had some long-term houseguests and I felt like I was <br/>
parenting under a microscope. Yuk. It helps *me* to focus as much as <br/>
I possibly can on my kids and helping them get their needs met. It <br/>
also helps me to think ahead and try not to put my kids (and <br/>
myself!) in situations that are too difficult for them to handle.<br/>
<br/>
Does your ds enjoy going to restaurants in general? If so, you might <br/>
want to take him out to eat without any company a few times so you <br/>
can really focus on his needs without the distraction of trying to <br/>
socialize with another adult. If he&#39;s not a fan of restaurants, but <br/>
you still want to eat out from time to time, consider getting him <br/>
something to eat before you go and bringing some books and toys for <br/>
him to play with while the adults hang out. <br/>

at times like this, like: &quot;He&#39;s so curious about everything!&quot; or &quot;He <br/>
comes up with such interesting projects!&quot; I find it really helpful <br/>
to make comments like this in a bright, cheerful tone. That helps <br/>
*me* re-focus on my child in a positive manner, while inviting my <br/>
friend or relative to to share my joy and enthusiasm.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the most helpful things I have read (was it Joyce maybe or <br/>
Sandra?) was to think of your kid as a guest whom you are hosting <br/>
from a completely different culture.  So, when you and your &quot;guest&quot; <br/>
engage in activities that are fairly foreign to him or her, a <br/>
kindness would be to help the guest understand what to do or what not <br/>
to do so that the guest can get the most enjoyment from the activity <br/>
and not feel terribly out of place or awkward.  I know if I were <br/>
visiting a place where I was completely unfamiliar with the social <br/>
norms and customs, I&#39;d want someone tugging my coat and letting me <br/>
know if what I was doing was cool or not.<br/>
<br/>
So, when you take your kids to a restaurant, it would be most helpful <br/>
of you to help them understand what the right thing to do in that <br/>
environment is.  And, if it&#39;s a kid who&#39;d really not be up to that <br/>
environment, don&#39;t go there yet.<br/>
<br/>
My son, who is now 12, is now conscious of wanting to do the right <br/>
thing in the right place.  That&#39;s what *he* wants.  It&#39;s my job as <br/>
his partner to help him get there (and not by shaming him, but by <br/>
gently helping understand what&#39;s okay and what&#39;s not okay--as I would <br/>
want someone to do for me).  When he was littler and doing the right <br/>
thing wasn&#39;t really so important to him, we just stayed away from <br/>
places where he couldn&#39;t be himself!<br/>
<br/>
I hope that&#39;s helpful!<br/>

there are a lot of different preparations, that way if you brought the<br/>
plate, the extra silverware would be all the extra he needed!<br/>

I&#39;m coming in late, but who leaves the salt/pepper/sugar mess for a waitress to clean up anyway?  <br/>
<br/>
Just because I went out to a restaurant doesn&#39;t mean I can leave a mess behind.  If/when my kids (or I) make a mess of a table, I clean it up before we leave.  <br/>
<br/>
I have, tho, seen those Moms at McD&#39;s or some other such place, who leave the table a mess, food on the floor, etc. McD&#39;s doesn&#39;t have a busboy or waiter -- the clean up falls to some poor employee who draws &#39;lobby&#39; duty.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a little cafe in my town where Dylan could have used multiple dishes <br/>
or otherwise played at and around our table, and the owner and patrons would <br/>
have been ok with that and there are places where that wouldn&#39;t be ok. <br/>
It&#39;s up to you  to understand the difference and to understand your child&#39;s <br/>
level of acceptance and understanding of the needs and rights of others, and <br/>
to not take him to places where he&#39;s not ready to be yet.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get any sense of the kind of restaurant you were in.   Was it a <br/>
friendly local place where they know you and your child and where his use of <br/>
multiple plates and flatware was fine with the owners and not disturbing the <br/>
other customers?   How many plates did he have?   Three might be fine in <br/>
some places and not fine in others.    Six is probably not fine anywhere but <br/>
home.  Were you there at their busiest time or during a lull?  .<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not an unschooling rule that says all kids should get to do whatever <br/>
they want, anywhere they want, all the time.   It might be fine at home to <br/>
stack up books and knock them down but it&#39;s not fine at the library.   It <br/>
might be fine at home to sing really loud but it&#39;s not fine in a movie <br/>
theater.  Mom&#39;s need to be aware of what their kids need, what is expected <br/>
in social situations and then not put a kid in a situation where he can&#39;t <br/>
willingly and happily meet the expectation.<br/>

It will be better for him if he knows some of the things we like to do (all <br/>
of us!) are not appropriate for every venue.   And if he&#39;s not quite ready <br/>
yet to understand that, then have your friends over to your house for coffee <br/>
and cake, where your son can happily use however many dishes he likes, and <br/>
you can poke your friend with a fork if she gets uppity.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555730814">My DS loves going to Cracker Barrel restaurants specifically because he<br/>
can order the 4 sides combo and have a whole assortment of plates and<br/>
bowls, a &quot;Feast&quot;. <br/>
 <br/>
I can offer {{hugs}} and suggest that next time the thoughts start<br/>
crowding in, take a slow, deep breath and kiss your son&#39;s head (if<br/>
that&#39;s usually okay with him). Maybe even bring it out into the open,<br/>
instead of trying to hide it e.g. &quot;Wow (son), looks like you&#39;ve got<br/>
everything organized - a set of utensils for each plate so you can keep<br/>
things separate&quot; I&#39;ve found that once I&#39;ve verbalized something like<br/>
this, it turns off the tapes that start spinning in my head AND it makes<br/>
it clear to whomever might be nearby enough to see it that it has my<br/>
explicit approval/acceptance KWIM? Defuses a lot of potential &quot;input&quot;<br/>
from others when it&#39;s been made clear that it&#39;s OK with me, has my<br/>
support (even if I&#39;m still a little uncomfortable with it). Later on,<br/>
somewhere safe (home, car, etc) and calm (and without others around), I<br/>
might discuss things like recycling, resources, extra work for others<br/>
and see what kinds of things we can come up with - for instance, my DS<br/>
likes to have a separate fork for his potatoes and his dessert (or<br/>
whatever) - BUT he&#39;s okay with it if I simply wipe it off thoroughly in<br/>
between one and the other. IF it doesn&#39;t come clean enough (some things<br/>
are just really sticky) THEN we&#39;ll get another fork. His need to have<br/>
clean/different utensils is honored and we use the minimum utensils most<br/>
of the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-926899148">Agreed, that if salt, pepper, etc have been played with it should get<br/>
cleaned up to make the staff&#39;s jobs easier. That does not mean that it<br/>
cannot happen, what it means is that once the play is done, clean up<br/>
happens  (we usually do it while waiting for the check to arrive),  just<br/>
as it would at our own table at home. Spilled/poured salt, pepper, etc<br/>
are pushed onto a plate or what-have-you so that the table surface is<br/>
reasonably tidied (there&#39;ll always be little crumbs and bits but that&#39;s<br/>
within normal operating parameters). Most of the time, for that matter,<br/>
we stack the plates and silverware and all and move it toward the<br/>
easiest to reach location on the table. My DH (not a typo, that&#39;d be my<br/>
hubby) likes to make ice cubes stick to plates with salt - but we&#39;ll<br/>
also either make that plate the top plate or we&#39;ll unstick it before we<br/>
leave so that there&#39;s little chance of it causing a stack of plates to<br/>
tumble.<br/>
