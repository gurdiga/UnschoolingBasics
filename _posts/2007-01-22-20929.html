<div id="ygrps-yiv-920176156">Thank you for all your great discussion on this. It was heavily posted and <br/>
heavily responded to.  Regardless of what the asker thought about it, I have <br/>
had some great reflection on this issue personally.<br/>
<br/>
I personally agree with the opinion that it is not a yes or no answer. It <br/>
depends on a large number of variable issues from person to person, age <br/>
being only one of those variables.<br/>
<br/>
Much Love<br/>
Wildflower<br/>
