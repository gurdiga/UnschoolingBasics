<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213478517">All of the previous posts just confirm my desire not to be labeled an uschooler. I have a problem with any kind of label being associated with me or my family. <br/>
 <br/>
Way back when I decided to teach my son at home, I went to an unschoolers meeting in Boston. After talking with the parents there and hearing their philosophy on not telling their kids what to do, no matter what the consequences. And not teaching them anything, let them learn it all on their own, I quickly changed my mind about being an unschooler. After much trial and error over the years, I realized that the best way for my kids to learn was to let them just do whatever it was that they were interested in. We got the basic math and english out of the way and they did, and still do what they are passionate about. <br/>
 <br/>
Though my method for school with my daughter is &quot;unschooling,&quot; I will no longer use that term to describe our situation. I see from this group that &quot;unschooling&quot; seems to also mean &quot;unparenting.&quot; I love my kids too much to just let them make decisions that will end up harming them. Yes, I believe in letting kids make mistakes to help them to learn and mature, but never to bring mental or physical harm to themselves. I don&#39;t care if you want to call it controlling, manipulating, whatever. I call it being a loving parent concerned for my child&#39;s welfare.<br/>
 <br/>
I am done with this group and the narrow minded way everyone seems to be when it comes to parenting a child. I also don&#39;t like the way so many have judged a family that no one on here even knew. I could understand if you actually saw the behavior you describe in person, but none of you did. You are all going by what you have read or saw on the news. And then making your own assumptions on how she was brought up.  I saw the real family, saw the love they had for their kids. What happened to them was a shock to all who knew them. What happened to them could have been avoided had their daughter respected them, and respected their wishes.<br/>
All you talk about is respecting your children, what about their respecting their parent. Does that suddenly not matter? <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy judging all those that don&#39;t believe in what you do, or fit into your perfect unschooling mold! <br/>
<br/>
Funny, I always thought that unschoolers would be the last ones to judge anyone else...wrong again!!<br/>

<br/>
This statement here proves that you have spent very little time around<br/>
any unschoolers or talking with them in any depth.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we trust our children can make their own decisions. But that<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean &quot;let them do whatever they want&quot; nor does it equal a<br/>
free-for-all that you are trying to paint.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a LOT harder to build trusting relationships (yet easier in the<br/>
long run) than to forbid and punish (which has already been proven to<br/>
NOT work). If you were open enough to ask HOW that can work and WHY<br/>
punishment and forbidding are less effective methods, we can give<br/>
specifics. The defensive nature and antagonistic way you are phrasing<br/>
things isn&#39;t going to lead to a back and forth in which we can all<br/>
discuss various options.<br/>
<br/>
If punishment and coercion don&#39;t work (and it&#39;s pretty obvious it<br/>
doesn&#39;t) then what are the options for parents? I believe that we can<br/>
live in a way that honors each persons needs and desires. I KNOW we<br/>
can live this way because we DO. <br/>
<br/>
I have four children that trust their needs/wants and desires are just<br/>
as important as mine.  It makes the flow of family life a lot better.<br/>
But it&#39;d hard to describe this trusting flow to an outsider that has<br/>
already decided we&#39;re a bunch of nuts.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing though, everyone is always commenting on how interesting<br/>
and nice my kids are.  Without forbidding, without punishing or laying<br/>
down any &quot;law&quot; I have four very different children that WANT to be<br/>
healthy and happy (even though they choose very differently from me at<br/>
times). <br/>

&gt; All you talk about is respecting your children, what about their <br/>
&gt;respecting their parent. Does that suddenly not matter? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If respect is something you value, its worthwhile to consider what, <br/>
specifically you mean by the word and then how to go about having <br/>
more of it in your life. Its also worthwhile to consider how people <br/>
learn things, so you can help your kids learn to be respectful. <br/>
<br/>
If by respect you mean &quot;compliance&quot; then a certain amount of that is <br/>
a result of personality. Some people like to smooth things over and <br/>
create a peaceful environment by nature, and will be compliant and <br/>
give up things they want in order to do that. If you or your <br/>
children are naturally compliant, then you may have a hard time <br/>
understanding how respect can look differently for different <br/>
personalities. <br/>
<br/>
If by respect you mean &quot;consideration&quot; then consider this - a person <br/>
who does a specific task because its expected of him isn&#39;t really <br/>
being considerate. I want my kids to be considerate as a spontaneous <br/>
act of generousity - and they are, sometimes. I cherish that. My <br/>
kids - even my teenage stepson who was en route to getting expelled <br/>
from public school - offeres to do and give things graciously, <br/>
generously. He is kind and thoughtful to my dd, even though he is <br/>
never required to do a single thing for her. He offers to help <br/>
around the house with no expectation of reward. This is the &quot;bad <br/>
kid&quot; who everyone at school said was disrespecful, angry and <br/>
dangerous. <br/>
<br/>
Here he&#39;s none of those things. <br/>
Here he, his needs and wants and wishes, are respected. <br/>
Funny how that works.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe a more understandable way of putting this is that we trust that  <br/>
our children can figure things out.<br/>
<br/>
*Part* of figuring things out is talking about  it. Kids aren&#39;t left  <br/>
alone to figure things out for themselves. They know, because we&#39;ve  <br/>
built up that trust that they can bring the things we won&#39;t  <br/>
necessarily agree with to us and we won&#39;t condemn them for it, that  <br/>
they can come to us for information and to use us as a sounding board  <br/>
to help them think things through.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t trust that they have and know everything necessary to make  <br/>
the right decision the first time. But we do trust that they are  <br/>
capable of thinking about a situation and learning from mistakes and  <br/>
going on to make even better decisions.<br/>
<br/>
The younger kids start the process of decision making, the better.  <br/>
It&#39;s better to start making decisions about which cartoons they like  <br/>
and which foods they like than start the whole process when a boy  <br/>
starts pressuring for sex.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest reason kids do dangerous, senseless things is because  <br/>
they feel controlled and untrusted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126462611">All of this &quot;proof&quot; from what is being said here and from what is read and seen, is too much. Nothing here is actual &quot;proof&quot;, again it is all speculation, and what others conclude.<br/>
 <br/>
I am not trying to paint anything, I am simply commenting back on what was said to me. I am responding to facts that are being said, not painting any pictures. What has been said is pretty clear and what I am supposedly &quot;painting&quot; is from what I am reading here. <br/>
 <br/>
Keeping up with all this is not something I really care to do. If reading into everything and analyzing everyone and everything that is said is what people enjoy, then that if fine. As for me I do have a life away from the computer and I am getting on with it.<br/>
 <br/>

their<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, changing your vocaulary from &quot;teaching him at home&quot; to &quot;allowing <br/>
him to *learn* at home&quot; would have been a good start, but nevermind....<br/>
<br/>
You weren&#39;t listening clearly probably. I bet NO ONE said, &quot;We don&#39;t <br/>
our kids what to do, no matter what the<br/>
consequences.&quot; I bet they said, &quot;We don&#39;t tell out kids what to do, but <br/>
we DO discuss their options and help them mae the best decision that <br/>
can make.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I bet they didn&#39;t say. &quot;And not teaching them anything, let them <br/>
learn it all on their<br/>
own.&quot; They  probably said, &quot;We don&#39;t *teach*; we allow them to learn by <br/>
opening as many doors as we can and helping them with their passions <br/>
and interests.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Your decision not to unschool must not have come *too* quickly, &#39;cause <br/>
you found yourslef here---and you haven&#39;t left!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Though my method for school with my daughter is &quot;unschooling,&quot; I will <br/>
no longer<br/>
use that term to describe our situation.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Good, because it&#39;s probably not.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I see from this group that &quot;unschooling&quot; seems to also mean <br/>
&quot;unparenting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Again---not seeing clearly. We write about that a lot. A LOT!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I love my kids too much to just<br/>
let them make decisions that will end up harming them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ever? How will you prevent that? Many decision hurt us. It&#39;s part of <br/>
the learning process. I see my role as helping them make better <br/>
decisions each time. To console them when they *do* get hurt. To <br/>
discuss what they could do differently next time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I believe in letting kids make mistakes to help them to learn and <br/>
mature, but never to bring mental<br/>
or physical harm to themselves. I don&#39;t care if you want to call it <br/>
controlling,<br/>
manipulating, whatever. I call it being a loving parent concerned for <br/>
my child&#39;s welfare.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You say po-TAY-to, I say po-TAH-to.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that the tighter you wind that rubber band, the further <br/>
it&#39;ll fly.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am done with this group and the narrow minded way everyone seems to <br/>
be when it<br/>
comes to parenting a child.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not done enough, it seems.<br/>
<br/>
But if you look clearly, we&#39;re a good bit more open-minded. We&#39;re <br/>
looking at things through a W---I---D---E lens. We&#39;re seeing the <br/>
situation from all points of view, not just that of the controlling <br/>
parent.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t thik these mainstream parents think they are doing *anything* <br/>
wrong. They truly believe that they are doing ALL THE RIGHT THINGS by <br/>
forbidding and controlling their teens. The problem is that the teens <br/>
ARE being controlled and manipulated and that they will rebel as soon <br/>
as they get the balls to take that flight.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t like the way so many have judged a<br/>
family that no one on here even knew. I could understand if you <br/>
actually saw the<br/>
behavior you describe in person, but none of you did. You are all going <br/>
by what<br/>
you have read or saw on the news. And then making your own assumptions <br/>
on how<br/>
she was brought up.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
All I have to go on is what you brought here to us on this elist. ONLY. <br/>
You said they forbade her to see this young man. That she was sneaky <br/>
and lied. THose are typical behaviors from controlled teens (actually <br/>
from *anyone* under someone else&#39;s control!).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I saw the real family, saw the love they had for their<br/>
kids. What happened to them was a shock to all who knew them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t have been a shock to me. I would have expected it---or <br/>
something similar---certainly not that drastic! Running away would have <br/>
been my first thought.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What happened to them could have been avoided had their daughter <br/>
respected them, and respected<br/>
their wishes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
How do you think respect is gained? Through threats and control?<br/>
<br/>
I can guarantee that&#39;s not how it works!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
All you talk about is respecting your children, what about their <br/>
respecting<br/>
their parent. Does that suddenly not matter?<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
It comes after years and years of respect for the CHILD.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Funny, I always thought that unschoolers would be the last ones to <br/>
judge anyone<br/>
else...wrong again!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
NOT judging situations makes all situations equally valid.  Making <br/>
smart, wise judgments is how we make smart, wise decisions. Accepting <br/>
what others do and say withOUT judgment is floundering. Weighing the <br/>
good and bad helps us make better decisions.<br/>

Yeah, that really seems...well, hurtful. I know I parent. I can&#39;t imagine  <br/>
that you know all the unschooling families, let alone their parenting styles,  <br/>
just from come commentary and discussion on an unusual and very frightening  <br/>
episode with one family. Seems to me that many of the group here are  processing <br/>
the subject, thinking out loud, gaining some clarity and trying to  make <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146426027">Hmm.  Well, perhaps before you leave, you could tell us more about your experience with unschooling in your family, instead of debating control and manipulation in someone else&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed from all your posts since you joined the list, not one of them talks about how unschooling works in your home.   You originally posted that you have a 22 yo ds and a 16 yo dd  that were/are unschooled.  Tell us about a typical day with either of them.  Tell us about *your* unschooling life now.  Maybe someone can learn something important from you.<br/>
<br/>
The owners, moderators and long-time list members have a wealth of wisdom to give.  They are happy to give it for free, to help others understand unschooling so they can live free, joyous and respectful lives with their children.   You&#39;ve taken up a lot of the list&#39;s time refuting people&#39;s loving lives with their kids.  Maybe really listening to what they are saying might be worth your time.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All of this &quot;proof&quot; from what is being said here and from what is read and seen, <br/>
&gt; is too much. Nothing here is actual &quot;proof&quot;, again it is all speculation, and <br/>
&gt; what others conclude. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not trying to paint anything, I am simply commenting back on what was said <br/>
&gt; to me. I am responding to facts that are being said, not painting any pictures. <br/>
&gt; What has been said is pretty clear and what I am supposedly &quot;painting&quot; is from <br/>
&gt; what I am reading here. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keeping up with all this is not something I really care to do. If reading into <br/>
&gt; everything and analyzing everyone and everything that is said is what people <br/>
&gt; enjoy, then that if fine. As for me I do have a life away from the computer and <br/>
&gt; I am getting on with it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enjoy your debates and judging everyone that doesn&#39;t agree with your philosophy, <br/>
&gt; I am done with all of this. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~~After talking with the parents there and hearing their <br/>
&gt; philosophy on not telling their kids what to do, no matter what the <br/>
&gt; consequences. And not teaching them anything, let them learn it all on <br/>
&gt; their own, I quickly changed my mind about being an unschooler~~ <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This statement here proves that you have spent very little time around <br/>
&gt; any unschoolers or talking with them in any depth. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, we trust our children can make their own decisions. But that <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t mean &quot;let them do whatever they want&quot; nor does it equal a <br/>
&gt; free-for-all that you are trying to paint. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a LOT harder to build trusting relationships (yet easier in the <br/>
&gt; long run) than to forbid and punish (which has already been proven to <br/>
&gt; NOT work). If you were open enough to ask HOW that can work and WHY <br/>
&gt; punishment and forbidding are less effective methods, we can give <br/>
&gt; specifics. The defensive nature and antagonistic way you are phrasing <br/>
&gt; things isn&#39;t going to lead to a back and forth in which we can all <br/>
&gt; discuss various options. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If punishment and coercion don&#39;t work (and it&#39;s pretty obvious it <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t) then what are the options for parents? I believe that we can <br/>
&gt; live in a way that honors each persons needs and desires. I KNOW we <br/>
&gt; can live this way because we DO. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have four children that trust their needs/wants and desires are just <br/>
&gt; as important as mine. It makes the flow of family life a lot better. <br/>
&gt; But it&#39;d hard to describe this trusting flow to an outsider that has <br/>
&gt; already decided we&#39;re a bunch of nuts. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Funny thing though, everyone is always commenting on how interesting <br/>
&gt; and nice my kids are. Without forbidding, without punishing or laying <br/>
&gt; down any &quot;law&quot; I have four very different children that WANT to be <br/>
&gt; healthy and happy (even though they choose very differently from me at <br/>
&gt; times). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427875942">I see from this group that &quot;unschooling&quot; seems to also mean &quot;unparenting. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Obviously the OP meant unparenting in a negative possibly hurtful way.......<br/>
   <br/>
  but I celebrate &quot;unparenting&quot;  just like unbirthdays ..........I have 365 days a year where I get to toss away my authoritarian ways and joyfully celebrate life with my kids. <br/>
