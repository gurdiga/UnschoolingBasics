<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002339120">Today I drove by a billboard featuring a mug of a young, smiling boy <br/>
with the caption, &quot;The physicist is missing his two front teeth.&quot;  <br/>
Under that was, &quot;For the future:  it&#39;s why teachers teach.&quot;  And it <br/>
made me to think of that video, here, let me see if I can find it ...<br/>
<br/>
... shoot, not finding it easily ... will try again later ...<br/>
<br/>
... meanwhile, my original point ...<br/>
<br/>
This idea upon which compulsory institutionalized education for <br/>
children is founded, this idea that we&#39;re building future citizens as <br/>
some kind of moral justification for robbing them of their right to a <br/>
democratic voice is so ingrained in our collective psyche, the <br/>
billboard was like to me being unable to see the forest for the <br/>
trees.  <br/>
<br/>
Imagine looking at our much loved babes -- much loved, today, right <br/>
now, for this moment -- and seeing only a future physicist.  Imagine <br/>
going to work every day with the context of that the point of our <br/>
endeavor is to mould young men and women into cogs to be fit into a <br/>
corporate infrastructure.  I think, what a gift it is to be home and <br/>
out and about with my children TODAY because I and they learn so much <br/>
about ourselves and each other TODAY.  <br/>
<br/>
My nine year old, for years, has been flummoxed by that condescending <br/>
question, &quot;And what are you going to be when you grow up?&quot;  Since he <br/>
was, like, two, he would quiz up his brow and respond with, &quot;Well, <br/>
I&#39;m a scientist.  Already.  Now.&quot;  He has no connection to this <br/>
notion that he is &#39;preparing&#39; for some future title.  He IS what he <br/>
is, today, right now, in this moment.  And I, I am grateful to have <br/>
been supported along the unschooly path by beautiful mentors who, <br/>
like me, enjoy our progeny TODAY, for what and who they are TODAY and <br/>
who are not preoccupied with a social construct that blinds us <br/>
collectively to the tragedy of robbing children of their rightful <br/>
places in the midst of our communities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-250712272">When my oldest was 14 yo, she was talking to someone at the State Fair about her sheep and goats, and the person said &quot;So you want to be a farmer when you go up?&quot; and she thought a moment and said &quot;No, I am a farmer now!&quot;  She told me this later and I was so proud of her!  Of course, she takes care of her animals totally by herself, unless she needs help or is away.  She actually wants to be a vet when she grows up.Suewww.freewebs.com/spothollowfarm<br/>
