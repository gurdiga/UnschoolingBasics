<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137671884">This is a really interesting article.  This brought up lots of<br/>
interesting discussion at the MySpace unschooling group I belong to.  <br/>
<br/>
I find it interesting how this man was so successful in his life, even<br/>
when illiterate, yet once he can read, he equates not having someone<br/>
else teach him to read with a form of child abuse!  This guy beat the<br/>
system, and now he&#39;s complaining about it!!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70812632">I had that same thought. Here was a guy who was successful by most <br/>
standards in spite of not ever learning to read. No one has focused on <br/>
that positive part of it.<br/>
