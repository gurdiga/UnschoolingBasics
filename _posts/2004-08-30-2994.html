<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286511271">Long before I had kids or had heard of unschooling or the radical <br/>
idea of treating kids with respect, I used to flinch at people who <br/>
lied to their kids without even considering telling them the truth.<br/>
<br/>
But...I&#39;m kind of afraid of telling ds (almost 4) that we&#39;re having <br/>
one of our cats put to sleep. (Not that I&#39;d use the word &#39;sleep&#39; if I <br/>
do explain it.) I guess I&#39;m afraid of him having the idea that we <br/>
kill someone if they are too sick. I think he could handle the idea <br/>
that Gizmo died because the vet couldn&#39;t save him, but I&#39;m worried <br/>
about questions about people getting sick enough to be &quot;put down&quot;. <br/>
That seems like a tougher subject. <br/>

Am I wimping out? I don&#39;t know. Dh won&#39;t be able to handle ANY <br/>

just like my FIL did), so I&#39;m on my own.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there&#39;s a middle ground, like explaining that the vet couldn&#39;t <br/>
do anything besides make sure Gizmo wasn&#39;t hurting anymore--leaving <br/>
out the fact that we went there knowing what was going to happen.<br/>

Any clear thinking on this subject would be appreciated, because it&#39;s <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893233471">I think explaining that it is the alternative to a lot of pain may<br/>
work. My daughter was about 9 when we went through this, though... but<br/>
she found a cat that had been hit by a car nd was trynig to nurse it.<br/>
When I found out about this I realized that the cat had a compound<br/>
fracture at a minimum so we took her to the vet (me debating how much<br/>
I can afford to spend on a stray cat) and found out that the leg was<br/>
hopeless and there were unknown internal injuries too. We explained<br/>
that the kitty was probably going to die anyway and did not understand<br/>
anything except that she hurt really bad. My daughter cried a little<br/>
and asked for time to say goodbye. It seemed to help when I pointed<br/>
out that at least the kitty died knowing somebody cared about her.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How sad for you aj, it has been our experience that our children have been <br/>
able to handle the truth quite well, when it is given kindly and explained well. <br/>
We have been open to discussing the entire aspect of euthanasia of pets with <br/>
our ds, now8.5, and he has been great with it. We had a small dog that was my <br/>
son&#39;s, and he had an auto-immune disease, and we had to euthanise him to ease <br/>
his suffering, and that ws exactly how we told Tommy , he was there, and we <br/>
consulted him about it, and he agreed it was the kindest thing to do. Now he was <br/>
6 at the time, and chose not to be present for the act. We have had a dog put <br/>
down , and telling tommy about it ahead of time gave him time to say good-bye <br/>
and talk about the dog and what he loved about her, to give her a cookie, and <br/>
really grieve without any surprise. <br/>
That is what worked for us, and it has set the stage for some really open <br/>
communication about death, dying, and life. He did have some anxiety about us <br/>
dying, but I think they all go thru that at some point. <br/>
Children are remarkable in their capacity to understand and care for pets, <br/>
this can be seen as part of that process, I believe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907547456">Hi Aj,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry to hear about your dear cat.  We had a dog who died when <br/>
our ds was 9 mos. I do believe that kids take in what they can manage <br/>
at the time.  He has asked about Gus and I told him what happened to <br/>
him.  At 3 and 4, he talked about him many times.  I might have said <br/>
something to a friend and then later my ds would say something like, <br/>
&#39;Gus is just at the vet&#39;s.  He didn&#39;t die.  Sometimes it just takes a <br/>
long time for dog&#39;s to get better.&quot;  I guess I would try telling your <br/>
ds what&#39;s going on and follow his lead w/ what he wants to know.<br/>
<br/>
I feel for what you&#39;re going through.  It&#39;s so hard. It seems so <br/>
difficult to separate our own fears about these things from what an <br/>
open child might take them to mean..  Let us know how this goes and <br/>
know we&#39;re thinking of you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-460077710">Hi, aj,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to hear you are going through this.  Losing an animal is really hard.<br/>
We had to put down the cat who was best friend to my husband (had him since<br/>
college when the cat was a kitten) when I was 8 mos pregnant with my son.<br/>
My daughter was 2.2 yrs old and VERY attached to that cat.  He was a big old<br/>
tomcat with an amazingly easy disposition and used to let her sit on him and<br/>
&quot;ride him&quot; - his name was Suji and he was like her brother at the time.  I<br/>
think it helped that she went to the vet and was there when the vet talked<br/>
to us about him - his kidneys had stopped working, he was old, and that&#39;s<br/>
what we reiterated to her.  We had a conversation about how all living<br/>
creatures get old and their bodies stop working, and I made sure to throw in<br/>
that for people it&#39;s a good long time.<br/>
<br/>
I was very hesitant, like you, about how my sensitive daughter would take<br/>
all this.  Personally I didn&#39;t consider myself all that close to the cat and<br/>
I sobbed for a day and a half.  My daughter amazed me with the way she<br/>
handled it.  She used play acting - pretended she was the vet and re-enacted<br/>
the whole trip to the vet experience, giving her cat a checkup.  My daughter<br/>
also used to refer to herself a lot in the third person to talk about things<br/>
she found difficult (something that evolved out of our storytelling).  She<br/>
went through a period where when she called herself &quot;Suji&quot;, the cat&#39;s name,<br/>
when she was doing this.  So she&#39;d say &quot;Suji didn&#39;t like the way that boy<br/>
was playing&quot; for instance, meaning herself.  So I came away from the whole<br/>
thing amazed at my child&#39;s ability to use the tools at her disposal to<br/>
process and handle the event of Suji&#39;s death.  I&#39;d be willing to bet your<br/>
child will amaze you also.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-766540325">We are getting ready to go through this too.  Our dog of 8 years has <br/>
been diagnosed with nasal carcinoma, he doesn&#39;t have long.  Most <br/>
likely we will end up having to put him down.  I&#39;ve also been <br/>
wondering how to tell my son, he is almost 5.  He is very attached to <br/>
this dog.  I know I have to tell him the truth and be very careful to <br/>
avoid words like putting to sleep.  It is going to be so hard.  I cry <br/>
just thinking about it.  Good luck.  Let us know what you do and how <br/>
it goes, any advice will be useful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-725638717">I&#39;m wondering how folks on this list who celebrate Christmas handle the<br/>
topic of Santa.  I went with my gut instinct when my kids first asked about<br/>
Santa and told them he was part of the spirit of giving at Christmas time<br/>
and that he was pretend like Barney...lots of fun to read about him, talk<br/>
about him, watch videos about him, but it was mama and daddy putting their<br/>
actual presents under the tree.  And we have handled the Tooth Fairy thing<br/>
the same way - fun but pretend.  It feels better to me to present it this<br/>
way, they&#39;ve responded fine to it, the only hitch being when other kids<br/>
believe Santa and the tooth fairy are real and I&#39;m not sure what the best<br/>
way to explain that to my kids is ... I&#39;m pondering saying &quot;Well in that<br/>
family they like to play a game where Santa is real&quot; or something similar.<br/>
I guess I want to show respect for other family&#39;s choices but explain it in<br/>
a way that makes sense with my decision.  Any ideas or alternate way of<br/>
handling this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks...<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719602142">We just flat out told Lydia (now almost 7) that some people tell their children that Santa is real, and that it is unkind to tell those children that Santa is not real - under the general principle of not bursting other people&#39;s bubbles.  It goes along with not expressing her unfavorable opinion of art that other children are proud of and similar issues of celebrating rather than dampening other people&#39;s happiness. <br/>
<br/>
 She wanted to know why the parents do that, and I told her that the parents thought that would be best, or more fun for the kids, or something like that.  I think she finds it inexplicable, but she finds a lot of things that other people&#39;s parents do inexplicable.  It doesn&#39;t seem to bother her and the only time that it has been an issue was when her friends tell stories designed Lydia clearly knows to be untrue (like her friend who said that she once saw Santa coming down her chimney) (They just agreed to disagree), and the time that a bunch of girls at gymnastics were badgering Lydia to agree to believe in the tooth fairy.   She ended up telling them there was no tooth fairy, which made the gymnastics staff annoyed with her (rolls eyes).  I told her that she didn&#39;t have to engage with people on these questions - and really the best tactic was to agree to disagree.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189086061">They had this discussion not too long ago on Unschooling Discussion <br/>
if you want to go look through the archives.  I was one who said that <br/>
I told my son about Santa and the tooth fairy because we don&#39;t really <br/>
know for sure they don&#39;t exist.  Just because we haven&#39;t seen them <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t real.  I&#39;ve never seen an electron or a <br/>
quark, doesn&#39; mean I don&#39;t believe they are real.  I choose to <br/>
believe Santa and the tooth fairy are real in some way.  So that is <br/>
what I tell my son I believe.  I know they aren&#39;t leaving presents <br/>
under the tree or putting money under my son&#39;s pillow but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean they don&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
I also believe in fairies in general and my son and I put honey out <br/>
for them.  One time we had a beautiful flower grow in the exact spot <br/>
we put the honey.  We didn&#39;t plant the flower.  During Yule my son <br/>
gets presents from Mother Earth.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel it is lying to him, because I do believe these things <br/>
exist.  If at some point in his life he decides the evidence isn&#39;t <br/>
strong enough to support his believe, that is fine.  It won&#39;t change <br/>
what I believe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270236920">When my oldest was 2 he started asking, &quot;Who is that man with the beard?&quot;<br/>
He noticed the image seemed to be just everywhere (it was December).  We<br/>
told him &quot;That&#39;s Santa Clause - He reminds us to be generous&quot; No mention at<br/>
that time about real or not real.  Later we checked out a book from the<br/>
library about the history of St. Nicholas, which included pictures of the<br/>
images as they evolved over time and stories, associated with him in<br/>
different countries. We borrowed this book many times over the years.<br/>
 We put out shoes on St Nicolas Tag and stockings at Christmas and generally<br/>
had a great time with it.  The main point we made with him was that people<br/>
would sign Santa&#39;s name when they wanted to be anonymous.  So, if you get a<br/>
present from Santa, it&#39;s because someone wanted to make you happy with a<br/>
present but didn&#39;t want to tell the secret of who the gift was from.  This<br/>
worked out well for ds.  He always got it that he shouldn&#39;t spoil the fun by<br/>
explaining that Santa is not real.  He got to pretend if he wanted to (he<br/>
rarely did though) and he could surprise others with gifts &quot;from Santa&quot;.<br/>
DD went through a time about age 6 when she really believed in Santa and<br/>
wanted us to as well.  For her, the magical stories and movies on tv were<br/>
utterly convincing.  We let her believe.  Didn&#39;t spoil her fun but one thing<br/>
we were sure not to do was to egg it on.  The aspect of Santa I find<br/>
disturbing is where adults manipulate children by telling them bald-faced<br/>
lies to try to get the kids to behave &quot;or you&#39;ll get a lump of coal&quot;.  Or<br/>
Santa can see that - you better be good.  I think when the kids put together<br/>
a mythos for themselves about santa that&#39;s much more fun than if the adults<br/>
try to &quot;teach&quot; them that he is real and going to elaborate lengths to hold<br/>
up the myth.  The favorite stories around here about the big guy are the<br/>
early ones from Italy and Romania and the modern ones where the love of the<br/>
parents for the children is highlighted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329090686">Thanks for the advice and support. I haven&#39;t had time to write any <br/>
responses because my dd has decided that sleep is optional!! Argh.<br/>

I think I&#39;m going to talk to ds and just take it one statement at a <br/>
time and see how it goes. Gizmo has avoided Mikey since he started <br/>
crawling, so Mikey isn&#39;t close to him or really aware of how sick he <br/>
is.<br/>
