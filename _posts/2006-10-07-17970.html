Our country&#39;s custom is to call the president &quot;Mr. President&quot; and that&#39;s <br/>
what I would do and that&#39;s what my son would do because he seems fair adept <br/>
in social skills.   But as to ma&#39;am-ing and sir-ing random hers and hims <br/>
there is no custom left in our part of the country which calls on young <br/>
people to use such terminology.   If Dylan found himself in a situation <br/>
where such a custom existed he&#39;d be polite and follow the custom.<br/>
<br/>
But if an adult refers to Dylan by his first name I can&#39;t think of any <br/>
reason Dylan should not respond in kind.  And if it&#39;s about respect then I <br/>
would say my son is as entitled to respect as any ma&#39;am or sir.  If it&#39;s <br/>
about respect would it be disrespectful of them to say &quot;Dylan?&quot;   And if <br/>
it&#39;s about respect why do children deserve less respect than adults?  Or, <br/>
why are children expected  to &quot;show&quot; respect in a way adults are not?<br/>

It seems wiggly, really.  Respect is more than a spoken &quot;ma&#39;am&quot; or &quot;sir.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These are all very hypothetical situations which happen to an<br/>
individual so very rarely (especially meeting the leader of a<br/>
country!) for most individuals that it is hard to even imagine.  Being<br/>
polite does NOT require a &quot;ma&#39;am&quot; or a &quot;sir.&quot;  Being polite means just<br/>
not being offensive.  I have never stressed the &quot;ma&#39;am and sir&quot; thing.<br/>
 Never.  Even before I was unschooling.  I also don&#39;t insist that my<br/>
children call adults by Mr. or Mrs.  _______.  Just their names.<br/>
That&#39;s how I introduce them to my adults friends.  &quot;Martha this is my<br/>
daughter Emily.  Emily this is my friend Martha.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I actually would be concerned about my child meeting our current<br/>
president as she is not a fan of his.  I can just see her glaring at<br/>
him and giving her a piece of her mind (although this meeting would be<br/>
SO unlikely as I am quite sure that the  Secret Service would know<br/>
full well what her opinions are way before the meeting!)<br/>
<br/>
Michelle - who actually punched the last police officer who pulled her<br/>
over (it was my brother who routinely pulls me over just to harass me<br/>
which has taught me when not to drive through the town he works at<br/>
during shift changes!)</div>

My ds (now 15) was sick at school alot - he was in 2nd grade. I do believe the school made him physically ill.  But one day, when I went to pick him up, the teacher said &quot; Alex is not sick, he&#39;s faking it and I feel he should be made to stay & stick it out.&quot;  Well Alex promptly threw up all over her shoes ! I looked at her and said &quot;Well I feel he is sick & we&#39;ll be leaving now.&quot;   Thats when we decided public school was no longer an option.<br/>
