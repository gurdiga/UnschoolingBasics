<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515884302">To everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t thank you all enough for the wonderful ideas and thoughtful <br/>
sharing of experiences. They have all been SO helpful and have given <br/>
me a lot to think about.<br/>
<br/>
Like Mary said, to leave the learning co op would be a grieving <br/>
process, for sure. What an amazing group of mothers and children. BUT <br/>
they do hold events that we may still be able to share in from time to <br/>
time. For instance, I plan many field trips with them. It&#39;s good for a <br/>
discount rate and it always adds to the fun :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, in regards to leaving Christian at home.. He&#39;s been left home <br/>
many times for about a year now. The issue I have is with the time and <br/>
distance. The more I mull it over though, there ~may~ be a way to <br/>
arrange with my second shift husband and to simply ~not~ stay all day. <br/>
I did talk to Christian again about it. He IS happy to be there. Maybe <br/>
he just doesn&#39;t need the classes, or needs the option to NOT attend if <br/>
he doesn&#39;t want, or to just not go. He does enjoy the courses.. <br/>
there&#39;s art and science and chess. It&#39;s definately more school-y than <br/>
unschooling but not nearly what it may sound. There&#39;s no homework, the <br/>
kids&#39; interests are followed in choosing what to talk about, etc. <br/>
Having been our first year at this, it was a nice &#39;bridge&#39; for the <br/>
time being while we were finding our way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also taken much of the advice on the board and started delving <br/>
into my own interests again. I picked up the neatest book on country <br/>
living and I have bread rising in the kitchen as we speak! I love <br/>
gardening and my beds look nice this year (so far) and I&#39;ve begun <br/>
planting in my vegetable garden. <br/>
<br/>
So, bottom line is THANK YOU everyone. I ~loved~ hearing about your <br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Warm regards,<br/>
Tonya</div>
