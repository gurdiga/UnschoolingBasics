<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069473856">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
Glad to report that although I still feel some uneasiness, I have <br/>
loosed my grip on the food issue.  My dds are doing well and are <br/>
happy having more freedom.  They seem to be slowing down a little <br/>
with the binging and begging, etc. as the novelty is wearing off. <br/>
Joyce, thanks for you response to aj concerning sitting at the table <br/>
for dinner.  This has also been an issue for us (especially dh) and <br/>
your post helps.<br/>
<br/>
So here goes with the NEXT issue...  It has been suggested to me that <br/>
forcing children to clean up after themselves is not respectful or <br/>
healthy, and that having toys, etc. picked up is a parent&#39;s issue. <br/>
For some time, we have imposed clean up time once or twice a day and <br/>
required the girls (3 & 5yo now) to put away toys in the living room <br/>
and throughout the house.  Of course, they have never wanted to do so <br/>
at any time, and in the past we have used punishment as an <br/>
&#39;incentive&#39; but have decided, after seriously questioning our <br/>
lifestyle that we don&#39;t want to coerce this any more either.    <br/>
<br/>
Our house is very small and our humble livingroom is the only place <br/>
toys can be kept. So it gets out of control to the point that I <br/>
cannot stand the clutter/lack of floor and sitting space.  If left <br/>
unchecked, it spills over into the kitchen and diningroom and starts <br/>
to choke out the entire house.  At times before we would help the <br/>
kids clean up, and try to make the chore a game by singing songs, <br/>
etc.  Now and then we would get good results, but usually ended up <br/>
with two frustrated or angry parents who did most of the work.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, we want good relationships with dds, and are seeing <br/>
that perhaps cleaning should be up to us, as we did choose to have <br/>
children and provide them with the toys. And a tidy home (key word: <br/>
tidy, NOT perfect)is just not a priority that the kids (and not <br/>
really to dh, sigh) can understand yet. We have stopped making it a <br/>
daily requirement (and I have been trying to let the mess bother me <br/>
less) and have been saying, &quot;I would like to get these toys put away <br/>
today&quot; instead of &quot;time for you to clean up&quot;. Then one or both of us <br/>
does the job and casually asks the kids for help.  When they refuse <br/>
(act deaf) we have been trying to let this go, BUT...I (more so than <br/>
dh) still feel, deep down, anger and resentment at times when I <br/>
am &#39;stuck&#39; cleaning up after them while they sit and watch or go <br/>
merrily on their way. Hmmm...is this how they felt when I made them <br/>
do it alone?  <br/>
<br/>
I have been feeling selfish - it really upsets me that I do so much <br/>
for the family and no one (not even dh, really, but he tries to keep <br/>
the peace)wants to help me take care of things that are important to <br/>
me now and then. I have been controlling in the past, so perhaps that <br/>
is part of the issue right now, but as we have relaxed our parenting <br/>
over the last few months, I wonder is anyone appreciative at <br/>
all?  I am almost 9 months pregnant and cannot physically keep up <br/>
with all that I usually do.  I have been skimming the surface and <br/>
leaving the toys, but after several days, it needs an overhaul so we <br/>
can utilize the house comfortably!  I just wanted to cry today as I <br/>
was bending over (difficult task) doing it myself again before <br/>
company came.  It didn&#39;t bother anyone else but me.<br/>
<br/>
Help me see the light?  Or get my head out of the sand (or at least <br/>
above water)?  Or do I just need a hormone adjustment?<br/>

Hi, Melissa,<br/>
<br/>
I feel for where you are at!  I have been through a lot of the mental<br/>
wondering about cleanup that you are pondering here (without even being all<br/>
hormonal and the whole bending thing!) and have gotten to a better place<br/>
somewhat over time, so I&#39;d be happy to share my own thoughts in the event<br/>
they are helpful.  FYI my kids are 5 and 3.  I also have a small house and<br/>
it doesn&#39;t take much time before I am getting grumpy tripping over toys and<br/>
there&#39;s no room left to set up the next project.  I have definitely<br/>
identified a need in myself for a certain amount of tidiness and have tried<br/>
to honor that as well as the needs for my kids to play and learn and<br/>
experiment all of which equal greater clutter.<br/>
<br/>
I have never had much luck and not spent much time on forcing or punishment<br/>
type things for cleanup.  My husband sometimes tries it and it never works.<br/>
When my daughter was younger she was very amenable to me making it more of a<br/>
game (sing the Barney song or ask &quot;What color do you want to pick up?  You<br/>
want red?  Okay, I&#39;ll clean up yellow... or alternately it&#39;s more fun to<br/>
pick up certain things if you get to &quot;throw&quot; them in the appropriate<br/>
container) so we did a lot of that.  My son doesn&#39;t respond so much to that.<br/>
Where we are at now is that I&#39;m probably less bothered by the clutter than I<br/>
used to be, but also I&#39;ve discussed with my children how clutter makes me<br/>
feel and my needs around it and we&#39;ve found some things that work.  I find<br/>
discussion with them at an age appropriate levels about my needs and<br/>
feelings a big key to both helping me move to a better place and also<br/>
enlisting their help in just about all areas where here we are trying to<br/>
together with different needs and tolerances.<br/>
<br/>
So these days to enlist their help cleaning up I have a few things.<br/>
Sometimes I go with &quot;Okay, to start this next project you want, I think we<br/>
need to make some space by cleaning up the last few things you guys did.<br/>
I&#39;m ready to help you set up the next thing when we get all of that cleaned<br/>
up&quot; and that works a lot ... we all pitch in together to clean it.<br/>
Sometimes I just go with &quot;Okay, it&#39;s getting late in the day and we have a<br/>
lot of old projects not cleaned up yet.  Mom&#39;s tripping over things.  You<br/>
guys are asking for more toys to come out from the closet.  I like to help<br/>
you with the things you want, and I need you to help me now get the clutter<br/>
picked up which is something mama wants&quot;.  They are really responsive to<br/>
that for the most part.  I see it as getting cooperation that enables all of<br/>
us to live together peacefully in the same space.  I help them with what<br/>
they want and let them know that I expect they will help me.  It is seldom<br/>
that they will choose not to do the next project to avoid cleaning up.  I<br/>
still clean up quite a bit after my 3 year old because he is after all 3 and<br/>
his capabilities of making a mess far exceed his clean up capabilities, but<br/>
it&#39;s important to me that he pitch in and make an effort - if I see him<br/>
helping I find that even if I&#39;m doing a lot of it, I&#39;m not so angry and<br/>
cranky.<br/>
<br/>
Also as long as I see them willing to help and take some responsibility for<br/>
their messes I find that I can handle the new messes with more equanimity<br/>
instead of a long held inside repressed sigh.  I find it funny that as I<br/>
write this my daughter, son and niece have taken every book off our three<br/>
shelf bookshelf of kids books, stewn them on the floor and are having fun<br/>
with them - my son mostly walking over the piles, my daughter and niece<br/>
actually looking at what they find.  It&#39;s a huge mess, but I didn&#39;t blink an<br/>
eye when they made it because I know I will have some cooperation at some<br/>
point cleaning it up so I can enjoy the bonding with all those books they<br/>
are having without inwardly seething that I&#39;ll have to clean it all up<br/>
myself.  So my suggestion is talk to them about how you feel and try some<br/>
different ways of enlisting their cooperation and see what works for all of<br/>
you.  I think it&#39;s important to honor your own feelings and your children&#39;s<br/>
as well about how they like to be treated (not many of us like to be<br/>
dictated to, but most of us are more than willing to help if we are part of<br/>
a team) so you can all live together in harmony.  It&#39;s not a &quot;parent<br/>
problem&quot;, it&#39;s a &quot;family issue&quot; in my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754116134">Just a thought ;)<br/>
<br/>
You say that the toys can only be kept in the<br/>
livingroom?  How about, now that you&#39;re relaxing about<br/>
eating, you get rid of the dining room table and turn<br/>
that into a cool play room, with bright shelves and a<br/>
TV, playstation, all that.  We did something similar a<br/>
few years ago--we have a small house, with three small<br/>
bedrooms, and took one of the bedrooms, patched the<br/>
doorway that was in the hallway and cut a hole to it<br/>
from the living room.  Then we put cool french doors<br/>
on it.  It has long, low shelves that offer for ease<br/>
in cleaning, and I bought wicker baskets for $1 at<br/>
walmart and fill them with toys.  NOT to say that we<br/>
mandate toys stay in that room or anything, but it is<br/>
a really cool room with no other furniture but toys<br/>
and bean bag chairs, and a pop machine, and<br/>
tv/vcr/tivo/playstation....so lots of playing does<br/>
happen there.  Since we family bed, we were only using<br/>
it as a guest room anyway, and that&#39;s just stupid!  If<br/>
we have guests, they can sleep on the couch or stay in<br/>
a hotel!  My kids should be comfortable all the time!<br/>
<br/>
As for enforced cleaning, obviously it sounds like it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be an option for you, but my husband and I<br/>
spend about 2 hours cleaning on Saturday morning, and<br/>
that&#39;s when most of the cleaning gets done for the<br/>
week.  Other than that, there&#39;s laundry and dishes and<br/>
garbage and that stuff, but clutter gets de-cluttered<br/>
and put where it belongs once a week, to start the<br/>
migration out again.  It helps a lot that most of the<br/>
toys are in the playroom, and that there&#39;s a door<br/>
there in case of guests (who am I kidding--no one ever<br/>
visits :( but other than a weekly pick up we would<br/>
rather spend time living than cleaning...<br/>

Yes, this more than anything seems to help in all situations WHEN I <br/>
can find the appropriate words to say (without sounding coercive or <br/>
like a martyr), in a way they can understand where I am coming from.  <br/>

I have said something like this (which as you worded it, sounds <br/>

Dh has been working a lot, and is up to his ears in things he is <br/>
struggling to accomplish most of the time (ie yardwork, vehicle <br/>
repair, etc.) but he does help when he can.  I usually have to <br/>
specifically ask, or he does not see what the need is. Today I <br/>

approach to the toy situation.  I wonder, if he was the one to <br/>
encourage the kids to help HIM to help me, if they might respond <br/>
better than if I ask myself?<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Yes, this more than anything seems to help in all situations WHEN I<br/>
can find the appropriate words to say (without sounding coercive or<br/>
like a martyr), in a way they can understand where I am coming from.<br/>
I am still struggling with the approach, and if I don&#39;t get it just<br/>
right, older dd does not respond.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hear you.  I find it&#39;s good to wait till I&#39;m feeling calm and not do it in<br/>
a moment of anger.  Waiting till I&#39;m calm makes it more likely things will<br/>
come out sounding a way I end up liking.  How about something like &quot;Gosh,<br/>
have you guys noticed how big this new baby is getting?  It&#39;s really hard<br/>
for me to bend down to pick up, and I&#39;m worried I&#39;ll trip over some of these<br/>
toys and fall down.  I could really use some help on this.  Do you have any<br/>
ideas on how we could keep things more tidy?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have said something like this (which as you worded it, sounds<br/>
great), but when it came out of my mouth, it sounded as if I was<br/>
saying I don&#39;t want to help you if you don&#39;t help me -- which is<br/>
probably not a good thing to communicate.  And I don&#39;t want to sound<br/>
as if I am bargaining/negotiating for help either???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rather than doing an &quot;if&quot; type of scenario, I strive really hard to make it<br/>
a &quot;when&quot; scenario which I feel is a different message.  I would not want it<br/>
to be &quot;if&quot; you don&#39;t help me, I won&#39;t help you, but &quot;Okay, I need some help<br/>
here and I&#39;m ready to help you with the next thing you want when this<br/>
cleanup is done&quot; message.  So it&#39;s how long do they want to wait which is up<br/>
to them.  For instance last night with the huge book mess, after I got off<br/>
the computer we all got busy reading.  Before I knew it it was 9:30pm.  I<br/>
asked them if they wanted to pick up now or tomorrow morning since it was so<br/>
late and it&#39;s a tall order to clean up such a mess late at night.  I was<br/>
willing to wait.  My daugher said &quot;tomorrow&quot;, so I said &quot;okay, so we&#39;ll do<br/>
it tomorrow after we&#39;ve had a chance to wake up and eat and before we go to<br/>
Plaster Fun Time (a trip we have planned today which she wants to go to<br/>
first thing).  As soon as she knew I was planning to do it before we went on<br/>
her outing, she declared &quot;No, I think I&#39;d rather do it now&quot; and we did.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think it would have been effective or made me feel we were working<br/>
together to say &quot;If you don&#39;t clean up this mess then we won&#39;t go to Plaster<br/>
Funtime at all!&quot; That type of &quot;if&quot; thing feels like a punative, angry<br/>
message to me.  The other thing I did that helps them is that with big<br/>
messes I&#39;ve noticed they often get overwhelmed and don&#39;t know where to<br/>
begin, so it&#39;s good to suggest jobs they can break up the task with.  Last<br/>
night I started with suggesting my daughter find all her magazines and put<br/>
them in a pile while I started on the bottom shelf, which got her going.  I<br/>
suggested my son go get the books that were out of my reach far away and<br/>
&quot;dump&quot; them near me (he loves to dump) which was a big help and within his<br/>
ability.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<br/>
Be kind to yourself. = )<br/>
<br/>
Ask your husband for help with the things that are bothering you.  If you<br/>
really want a clear space in the living room but can handle toys around<br/>
the parameter, let him know that so he has a definite idea what will help<br/>
you the most.  <br/>
<br/>
Your kids can&#39;t really know how draining it is to be pregnant.  They<br/>
can&#39;t really know your hormones are telling you to get everything ready<br/>
for your new baby.  They can&#39;t really understand how busy your going to<br/>
be when the baby comes or how worried you are that nothing will ever get<br/>
done.   It&#39;s not that they don&#39;t care about how you feel, they love you. <br/>
They are not trying to make things hard on you.  They want a happy home<br/>
life just as much as you do.  <br/>
<br/>
I think you can be secretly happy that you have such smart children.  If<br/>
you&#39;ve been grumpy and resentful while picking up toys they&#39;ve probably<br/>
come to think of picking up as an awful task that should be avoided.  I<br/>
think it might take some time with you and your dh modeling the cheerful<br/>
maintenance of your home for them to feel like helping. <br/>
<br/>
Are there things you could do to make putting the toys away easier?  Can<br/>
you put bins in convenient places or hang canvas bags on hooks on the<br/>
wall and stuff toys in there?  If it was really easy for the kids to do<br/>
and really easy to retrieve a toy again they might be more willing to<br/>
help.  Maybe you&#39;re doing this already.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have room for a little tent in your living room where you could<br/>
stash toys?  They might really like putting toys into the tent.   <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re making a lot of changes at a fairly stressful and physically<br/>
demanding time in your life.  I find that remarkable, Melissa.  You&#39;re<br/>
moving toward a better place, and it will get easier for you and your<br/>
family the more you live it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301897994">Joan - that was such a great description of exactly how to &quot;work <br/>
together&quot; in practice - as an alternative to ordering kids around. I&#39;m <br/>
saving that and will pull it out in the future as an example. Sometimes <br/>
this is hard to get across to people who are used to thinking, &quot;They <br/>
made the mess, they should clean it up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to bring this back to its unschooling connection - just in <br/>
case that isn&#39;t clear to people new to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
When we start trusting our children to learn what they need to learn, <br/>
when, and how -- this approach/attitude will soon naturally begin to <br/>
spill over into how we behave regarding things that aren&#39;t <br/>
&quot;educational.&quot; When we develop the collaborative kind of natural <br/>
learning lifestyle that is unschooling, we&#39;ll soon find that we are <br/>
closely examining how we relate to our children in other aspects of <br/>
life - food, bedtimes, television, and chores.<br/>
<br/>
When learning, which used to look like assignments, lessons, tests, and <br/>
grades, starts to be easy, calm, peaceful, joyful and natural, we often <br/>
start to think that maybe other areas of life with our kids that are <br/>
still hard and conflict-ridden can ALSO be transformed.<br/>
<br/>
That is why unschooling discussions gravitate naturally to include <br/>
talking about all aspects of life.<br/>

A quick little idea: if bending over is the worst part, ask the kids <br/>
to hand things to you when they are sitting on the floor. &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
cleaning up, but it hurts to bend over. Please hand me those 5 toys <br/>
and I&#39;ll put them away so that we don&#39;t step on them.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We play construction vehicles to clean up. So if the kids are cranes <br/>
or forklifts, they&#39;ll push stuff up to &quot;Mommy Dump Truck&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
This is just such a clear and practical, common sense thing to me. <br/>
<br/>
Our kids won&#39;t learn to read all at once.  It doesn&#39;t usually happen that<br/>
they pick up a book for the first time, look at the words and the next<br/>
time they pick up a book they can read.  Reading is a process.  Each kid<br/>
makes sense of the words in their own time.  <br/>
<br/>
So, when we&#39;re thinking of natural learning and the ways it spills over<br/>
into other parts of our lives, we should remember there is a process for<br/>
everything.  Every kid will make sense of things in their own time.   If<br/>
we&#39;re going to accept kids will gradually acquire reading skills, if<br/>
they&#39;re read to and see other&#39;s reading,  then it&#39;s easier to accept kids<br/>
will gradually acquire cleaning up skills if people clean up for them and<br/>
they see people cleaning up.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it.  My son does most of his own laundry.  He even has to get a<br/>
stool to stand on so he can reach into the washer to take stuff out, so<br/>
it&#39;s not the easiest thing for him to do, but he does it.  I never<br/>
required him to do laundry and I don&#39;t ever remember even asking him to. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll clean up hair balls if the cat spews.  He takes the garbage out<br/>
when he sees it&#39;s full.  He sometimes does dishes.   But none of that<br/>
happened all at once.  He didn&#39;t just wake up one day and know how to do<br/>
those things and have a desire to do them.  He lived with people who did<br/>
them because it made everyone&#39;s life a little better and less frustrating<br/>
when those things were taken care of.  He lived with people who did them<br/>
happily, (usually&lt;g&gt;) and who were happy to do things for him.  <br/>
