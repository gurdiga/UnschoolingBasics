<div id="ygrps-yiv-251950981">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this list.  My name is Lindsay and I&#39;m 29 and living in the <br/>
beautiful state of Oregon. I took my son Jackson (7) out of school <br/>
about 4.5 months ago.  I have 3 other, very young children, Kylie 2 <br/>
and 6 month old twins, Willow and Annabelle.<br/>
<br/>
I am struggling with the fact that due to the heavy load I must carry <br/>
with such young children that Jackson most probably will be back to <br/>
school in the Fall.<br/>
<br/>
We are looking at enrolling him in a spanish immersion school here in <br/>
our town.  I&#39;m trying to seek the best place for him since being at <br/>
home isn&#39;t the best option -- for now at least.<br/>
<br/>
Jackson is a brilliant child with a ton of energy.  His mind is 50 and <br/>
his body is 7 (at least that is how it seems to me).  Even if he does <br/>
go to school in the fall, we are dedicated to living a radical life.  <br/>
Kind of like radical unschooling with a little school in the mix ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m just looking for a place to get some of my thoughts out.  <br/>
I&#39;m hoping some who have been unschooling for awhile can share some <br/>
wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my oldest daughter was 6 I panicked that I couldn&#39;t &quot;do it all&quot; since I<br/>
had a 3yo and a newborn in the house.  I had &quot;too much to do&quot; to properly<br/>
homeschool her.  I wish I had known about unschooling back then and realized<br/>
that I truly didn&#39;t need to &quot;properly homeschool&quot; her.  I truly regret those<br/>
years she was in public school.  Even though she had two pretty amazing<br/>
teachers, the years it has taken to deschool all the schoolish ways has been<br/>
hard on both of us.  In reality, looking back, I probably created *more*<br/>
work than less by having her in school.  I *had* to be up at 6am every<br/>
morning with her school uniform ready.  I *had* to have a lunch packed for<br/>
her (she refused to eat school food).  I *had* to take her to school every<br/>
morning by 7:15 (7:15 for a baby to start sitting in class all day!) and<br/>
pick her up everyday at 2:30 (she went to a magnate program school and we<br/>
lived outside of that district).  Because I wanted to be involved in her<br/>
education this meant that I also had to drag an unwilling 3yo and a fussy<br/>
(because he wasn&#39;t doing what he wanted to do) baby to school functions,<br/>
field trips, class assisting, PTA meetings, and parent teacher conferences<br/>
(which this school required every 6 weeks in order to get report cards.)<br/>
Then there was homework that had to be done (yes; starting in kindergarden)<br/>
and other projects.<br/>
<br/>
Oh if I had only known the joys of unschooling and joyful living and had<br/>
allowed my daughter to be the nightowl she has always been so she could go<br/>
to bed when she was tired and wake when she was rested rather than fight<br/>
each night about bedtime because she needed sleep in order to be on her best<br/>
for school the next day (which she rarely was as she was usually awake until<br/>
midnight anyway!)  If I had only known how to let her enjoy living and trust<br/>
that she would learn the things she needed without school (which why I<br/>
thought she needed school after she taught herself to read at age 4 - with<br/>
*very little* help from me).  How much simpler our lives would have been had<br/>
I known about unschooling back then, rather than having to stumble on it<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
You pulled your son from school for a reason.  Look back and remember what<br/>
that reason was and whether you think it is a good choice to put your son<br/>
back into that situation again.  While it might seem like you will have more<br/>
time to focus on your younger children, is this really best choice for HIM?<br/>
Is this really the best choice for your family *as a whole*?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-139263715">Hi Lindsay,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list too. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve even posted an <br/>
introduction yet, but I wanted to respond to your post because I can <br/>
relate so well.<br/>
<br/>
I am 40 yrs old and the mother of five : Athena Grace-10, Jesse <br/>
Josiah-10, Malachi Jaedon-3, Isaiah Elias-2, Xanna Joy-9months. Yes, <br/>
the older ones are twins. I started homeschooling when the twins <br/>
were 7 and I was pregnant with Malachi. I lost Malachi&#39;s twin during <br/>
that pregnancy and had alot of other complications. Malachi was born <br/>
with a cleft lip and a heart condition. When we were trying to get <br/>
pregnant again, my husband was afraid I&#39;d end up on bed rest again <br/>
and wouldn&#39;t be able to homeschool both twins, so he sent my <br/>
daughter to public school. Worst mistake ever. She&#39;s a social <br/>
butterfly and just loved being surrounded by friends(Miss <br/>
Popularity), but neglected to do any school work. I don&#39;t believe <br/>
she learned a thing in that year. So, we went back to homeschooling <br/>
her. <br/>
<br/>
I have been homeschooling for four years and it has been a constant <br/>
struggle finding out how to school the twins. I wish I had known <br/>
about unschooling when I started. It&#39;s hard to get out of <br/>
the &#39;schooling&#39; mentality. I&#39;m still not totally there. However, if <br/>
you take time to write down everything the kids are learning without <br/>
being stuck at a table with books, it&#39;s amazing. My twins can run a <br/>
house by themselves including grocery shopping(comparitive price <br/>
shopping), cooking, changing babies, making formula, sterilizing <br/>
bottles, doing laundry, planting gardens, mowing & weeding, etc. My <br/>
husband owns an ACE Hardware Store so they also have had experience <br/>
with on-the-job training, customer service, organization, manners, <br/>
time cards, phone skills, paychecks, etc. <br/>
<br/>
My 10 yr old is very active (Sometimes down right wild) but he <br/>
taught himself to read at 4 yrs of age and is great at retaining <br/>
what he&#39;s learned. He has a love for science, space, natural <br/>
disasters, weather, and history. Through videos, field trips, and <br/>
google searches, he has learned so much more that even I can <br/>
remember from being in pulbic schools my whole life. <br/>
<br/>
I finally decided to stop giving weekly tests and just let the kids <br/>
learn. I was a straight A student in school and Valedictorian when I <br/>
graduated from high school. Went to college on a full scholarship. <br/>
However, I don&#39;t remember anything they I was ever taught in school <br/>
and none of what I was taught applies to the life I am living now. <br/>
I&#39;d rather my kids follow their own interest and remember what <br/>
they&#39;ve learned.<br/>
<br/>
Lindsay, having little ones around can be difficult at times. <br/>
However, the 6 &7 year olds are very similar in age. Keeping tabs on <br/>
the 2 yr old may seem hard, but don&#39;t feel bad to allow him to watch <br/>
some educational tv while the older ones are involved in something <br/>
else. My 2&3 year old can both count to 10, recognize letters, <br/>
complete puzzles, build with legos, role play, and even say some <br/>
words in spanish. They have learned to be independent and share. <br/>
There are plenty of activities available for them to do alone. If <br/>
all else fails, incorporate your older kids in helping with the two <br/>
year old. If things get out of hand around here, I will have each of <br/>
the 10 yr olds take time with the toddler and baby. They will play <br/>
with them outside or read them books(a good way to enforce their own <br/>
reading skills). Just having them one on one with the little ones <br/>
controls the chaos.<br/>
<br/>
All I can say is hang in there Lindsay. There are days I think it <br/>
would be so nice to ship them off to school, but I feel so called to <br/>
have them at home I know I&#39;d really be miserable. Believe in the <br/>
choice you have made and believe in yourself. My husband doewsn&#39;t <br/>
help out at home, but I have his support in my endeavors and that <br/>
means the world to me. Find a support system. I&#39;m learning adn <br/>
struggling right along with you. Feel free to drop me an e-mail if <br/>
you ever need to talk or vent.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725254206">Oh Lindsay, that is really tough. I wonder if you can put school out  <br/>
of the picture and come up with other ways to deal with the  <br/>
difficulties you&#39;re having.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have help with the little ones - maybe for a couple of hours a  <br/>
day? Can you get a mother&#39;s helper to come in and spend time with  <br/>
your son?<br/>
<br/>
An idea I&#39;ve never heard mentioned - contact Girl Scouts and see if  <br/>
there is a girl or two who might like to help you as part of a  <br/>
service project. To earn badges and patches, they always have to do  <br/>
some kind of service.<br/>
<br/>
Another option that I&#39;ve seen used, and it worked really really well,  <br/>
is not to send the child to actual school, but just to sign him up  <br/>
for an after-school (daycare) program. These CAN (you have to check  <br/>
them out) be fun - with a lot of emphasis on games and activities and  <br/>
projects. Also, parks and recreation departments often have after- <br/>
school programs -- these tend to be a bit more casual, less  <br/>
regimented, than the ones offered at the actual schools.  After- <br/>
school programs might run from 2 or 3 to 6 daily, that&#39;s 3 or 4 hours  <br/>
of supervised playtime with other kids. Might not be your ideal  <br/>
situation, but I think it would be a lot better than actual classroom  <br/>
schooling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lindsey, don&#39;t try to look that far into the future.  Think about what you<br/>
need and want to do right now.  What are your priorities?  What needs to get<br/>
done today?  Obviously you have 2 wee ones that really need a lot of your<br/>
attention.  What can  you do to help the older 2 be more self-sufficient?<br/>
I&#39;m not talking about housework (forbid!) or taking themselves to the<br/>
library, but simple things like having foods and drinks accessible.  Cheese<br/>
that is already cut up or apples already sliced.  Graham crackers that are<br/>
open and put in an easy to reseal container (like those ziploc sandwich<br/>
boxes that you just push to close).  If your 2 yo drinks from a sippy cup,<br/>
what if she had several that were already made up ahead of time waiting for<br/>
her in the fridge or on the counter?  A &quot;story basket&quot; set up beside<br/>
whatever chair you nurse your twins in?  Or (as I did with my last child) a<br/>
&quot;video basket&quot; with videos that we could watch together while I sat down<br/>
with the baby (nursing or not - sometimes just to take a load off!)  Someone<br/>
pointed out to me not long ago that laundry takes 10 minutes to do.  5<br/>
minutes to start a load and 5 minutes to &quot;flip&quot; a load.  I&#39;ve gotten to<br/>
where I pile the laundry on my bed and found that 2 loads of laundry a day<br/>
takes about 5 minutes to fold - 10 if it&#39;s whites (why is that?  LOL!)  And<br/>
some things just dont&#39; need folding - underwear, dust or burp rags, and<br/>
diapers - not that I have those anymore - they&#39;re all dustrags LOL!)  I have<br/>
a basket in each bedroom and in each bathroom.  I ask people to aim towards<br/>
the baskets.  It has helped immensly with the laundry struggles!<br/>
<br/>
Your twins are 6 months old now, but at the end of the summer they are going<br/>
to be 9 months old and by the end of the year 12 months old.  By this time<br/>
next year they are going to be busy little toddlers and you *will* have more<br/>
time (for yourself and your older children.)  What is the worst that could<br/>
happen if your son didn&#39;t go to school and didn&#39;t do any formal studies this<br/>
year?  You might surprise yourself to find that he will be immersed in his<br/>
passions and living life joyfully ............ and so will you!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Lindsay, is Jackson doing any summer day camp programs? If he likes going, that might really help to take the pressure off.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Oh Lindsay, that is really tough. I wonder if you can put school out  <br/>
&gt; of the picture and come up with other ways to deal with the  <br/>
&gt; difficulties you&#39;re having.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you have help with the little ones - maybe for a couple of hours a  <br/>
&gt; day? Can you get a mother&#39;s helper to come in and spend time with  <br/>
&gt; your son?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; An idea I&#39;ve never heard mentioned - contact Girl Scouts and see if  <br/>
&gt; there is a girl or two who might like to help you as part of a  <br/>
&gt; service project. To earn badges and patches, they always have to do  <br/>
&gt; some kind of service.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another option that I&#39;ve seen used, and it worked really really well,  <br/>
&gt; is not to send the child to actual school, but just to sign him up  <br/>
&gt; for an after-school (daycare) program. These CAN (you have to check  <br/>
&gt; them out) be fun - with a lot of emphasis on games and activities and  <br/>
&gt; projects. Also, parks and recreation departments often have after- <br/>
&gt; school programs -- these tend to be a bit more casual, less  <br/>
&gt; regimented, than the ones offered at the actual schools.  After- <br/>
&gt; school programs might run from 2 or 3 to 6 daily, that&#39;s 3 or 4 hours  <br/>
&gt; of supervised playtime with other kids. Might not be your ideal  <br/>
&gt; situation, but I think it would be a lot better than actual classroom  <br/>
&gt; schooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He&#39;ll probably feel resentful if you make him go when he doesn&#39;t want to. :-( It would be great if you get him some out of the house time without imposing the school bullsh*t on him. I really like Pam&#39;s suggestion of a daily after hours program.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi Lindsay. I&#39;m glad you found your way over here. This is a really <br/>
&gt; good place to explore your unschooling options.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; How is Jackson feeling about the idea of going back to school?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi All,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to this list.  My name is Lindsay and I&#39;m 29 and living in <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; beautiful state of Oregon. I took my son Jackson (7) out of school <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about 4.5 months ago.  I have 3 other, very young children, Kylie <br/>
&gt; 2 <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and 6 month old twins, Willow and Annabelle.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am struggling with the fact that due to the heavy load I must <br/>
&gt; carry <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with such young children that Jackson most probably will be back <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; school in the Fall.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We are looking at enrolling him in a spanish immersion school here <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our town.  I&#39;m trying to seek the best place for him since being <br/>
&gt; at <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; home isn&#39;t the best option -- for now at least.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Jackson is a brilliant child with a ton of energy.  His mind is 50 <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; his body is 7 (at least that is how it seems to me).  Even if he <br/>
&gt; does <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; go to school in the fall, we are dedicated to living a radical <br/>
&gt; life.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Kind of like radical unschooling with a little school in the mix <br/>
&gt; ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m just looking for a place to get some of my thoughts <br/>
&gt; out.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m hoping some who have been unschooling for awhile can share <br/>
&gt; some <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wisdom.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lindsay<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>

 However, the 6 &7 year olds are very similar in age. Keeping tabs on<br/>
 the 2 yr old may seem hard, but don&#39;t feel bad to allow him to watch<br/>
 some educational tv while the older ones are involved in something<br/>

I&#39;d drop the &quot;educational&quot; part of the tv viewing.<br/>

ALL tv is educational, if you choose to see it that way! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853139033">I just wanted to add what a GodSend Baby Einstein movies have been in<br/>
occupying my NT 4 year old while trying to deal with my 9 yo Aspie! <br/>
My Dh even commented that he loved Julie Clark one day and told me<br/>
(teasingly I think) that she did more for him those months than I ever<br/>
could!! :(<br/>
Seriously, I wish I was close to you, I can&#39;t ever get enough &quot;baby<br/>
