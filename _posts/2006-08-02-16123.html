<div id="ygrps-yiv-23966594">I&#39;m still a newbie too, by the way.  But I just wanted to let you <br/>
know that radical unschool works!  It does.  It&#39;s hard, it takes <br/>
patience.  It knocks your world upside down, but it works.<br/>
<br/>
Last night my 6 yr old son, who could be labeled an aspie, was <br/>
having one of his tantrums.  Normally I start shutting him down to <br/>
try and &#39;teach&#39; him how to behave properly (what an oxymoron!).  <br/>
This time instead of blowing up at him, I was honest and I let him <br/>
know that I was getting angry (the issue was he used the toilet and <br/>
didn&#39;t want to flush it) and I didn&#39;t want to talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway....he went upstairs, flushed the toilet, and came back <br/>
downstairs later and hugged me and said &quot;I&#39;m sorry for yelling <br/>
mommy.  You&#39;re the best mommy ever.&quot;  I was floored!!!  I told him <br/>
thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Now, can someone help me to help him see why he needs to flush the <br/>
toilet???  LOL<br/>

In our house we follow the motto: &quot;If it&#39;s yellow, let it mellow, if it&#39;s <br/>
brown, flush it down&quot; and our 2.5 year old son loves to flush everybody&#39;s <br/>
*browns*. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the best person to help you understand why <br/>
it&#39;s important to flush all the time...<br/>

<br/>
In terms of the OP, perhaps consider he might have sensitivity issues. <br/>
One of mine *hates* loud noises and often doesn&#39;t like to flush at home <br/>
and downright refuses in public restrooms with the huge whooosh! She <br/>
just steps out of the stall and covers her ears while I flush for her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, this brings me back.  I&#39;m remembering now <br/>
that when I was a wee one and was attending <br/>
kindergarten, I was scared sh*tless (pun <br/>
intended) of those oversized toilets there!  I <br/>
was sure I would fall in &#39;cause they were so <br/>
big!  And that whoosh!!  Yikes!!!  I was so <br/>
afraid, in fact, that I absolutely refused to use <br/>
them and would prefer to either wait and do my <br/>
bidness at home or ... well, you know (suffice to <br/>
say, I rarely was able to make it that long, if <br/>
ever).  I had a lot of accidents because of this <br/>
fear, and it was *very* humiliating.  (Probably <br/>
cost me a fiancé, too; I was engaged to young <br/>
Stephen B. back then, but he might have changed <br/>
his mind when he saw how incontinent I was.  But <br/>
I digress.)  Finally, after way too long of all <br/>
that, my folks and Mrs. Baum, my K teacher, and <br/>
the school nurse put their heads together and <br/>
figured out that they could let me use the <br/>
commode in the nurse&#39;s office, which was more like a home commode.<br/>
<br/>
But, you know, as stubborn and frightened as I <br/>
was about it back then, I seem to have no fears <br/>
or problems with those kinds of toilets today, <br/>
and, in fact, I grew out of that fear pretty <br/>
quickly, probably by the time I was 7!  I was <br/>
bound to and I most likely would have no matter <br/>
what, whether I had been treated compassionately <br/>
or whether I had been ridiculed and shamed (which <br/>
I was).  Therefore, (warning: rhetorical question <br/>
alert) why not be compassionate to little folks <br/>
when they&#39;re going through their issues?  Why not <br/>
hold a safe space for them to feel good about <br/>
themselves as they move themselves through <br/>
whatever it is they have to move through?<br/>
<br/>
Marji, who&#39;s literally simmering in this heat - <br/>
stick a fork in me; I think I&#39;m done!  (not <br/>
complaining, though; I reserve my right to <br/>
complain about the other end of the temperature spectrum!)<br/>

and you can go flush it. It can just sit there until the next person  <br/>
needs it and they can flush it. The phrase &quot;he needs to&quot; is often an  <br/>
indicator that a parent isn&#39;t recognizing a kid&#39;s actual needs, by  <br/>
the way. So - are you aware of why he isn&#39;t flushing? Are you trying  <br/>
to find a way to give him what HE needs?<br/>
<br/>
A couple of my kids went through a period of time of not wanting to  <br/>
flush the toilet. I just sort of walked through the bathroom every  <br/>
once in a while and flushed, if it needed it. Didn&#39;t turn it into a  <br/>
power struggle, didn&#39;t make any kind of point about it. And then one  <br/>
day noticed that they&#39;d started flushing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Keon is always in too much of a hurry to flush the toilet.  I didn&#39;t mind<br/>
him not flushing it once or twice, but after that it really needs to be<br/>
flushed just for clearing the air.  :)  One thing that I did for him was<br/>
laminated the word FLUSH (Stamped in really big colorful letters) and taped<br/>
it right at eye level.  Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn&#39;t. Another<br/>
thing that we will do periodically is to remind him as we see him headed for<br/>
the bathroom.  &quot;Flush please!&quot;  And for those times that I have passed his<br/>
bathroom and been overwhelmed, I will simple go in and flush.  One thing<br/>
that has helped is we purchased a KaBoom system for the tank (doesn&#39;t<br/>
corrode the toilet &quot;innards&quot; like the bleach tablets).  So the toilet stays<br/>
cleaner than before even with his sporadic flushing<br/>
<br/>
Remember, his lack of flushing is upsetting you not him, which means that it<br/>
is your problem not his.  :)<br/>

We have the same motto here.  Our town has septic systems, not town <br/>
sewerage, so it cuts down on water to not flush every single time.<br/>

public toilets.  At Disney they have automatic toilets.  The first time we<br/>
went after Mary Elayne was using the potty I would have to stand in the<br/>
stall with her and put my hand over the eye bending in shapes that I just<br/>
was not meant to be bending.  After that we bought a pack of sticky notes<br/>
and even now at almost 11 she still won&#39;t use an automatic toilet without a<br/>
sticky.  She&#39;ll be damned if she is going to have another toilet flush while<br/>
she is sitting on it.  I generally have to go in, put the sticky note over<br/>
the eye, she goes in and does her business and then I remove the sticky note<br/>
waving it in front of the eye to make it flush and depositing the sticky<br/>
note in the trash.  We even keep a pad of sticky notes in the car for those<br/>
times when we have to use rest area bathrooms while on the road.<br/>
