<div id="ygrps-yiv-511530184">Even though I have come to the conclusion that we mostly unschool here <br/>
it is still hard for me to let go of the &quot;school&quot; idea. Especially <br/>
since DH thinks they need to sit down for hours a day and do school <br/>
work. I understand the fact that children learn on their own and its a <br/>
natural process. I was looking through thier &quot;school&quot; books(we are <br/>
using a charter right now) trying to think of what to do for tomorrows <br/>
lessons. Everything looked so pointless, I kept thinking why do they <br/>
need to sit down with this book and &quot;learn&quot; this, they can learn that <br/>
on their own. The only book I could possibly think of using is their <br/>
math book. Knowing all this and believing in  unschooling doesn&#39;t help <br/>
me get over the idea that they need to sit and do lessons. Don&#39;t know <br/>
what exactly my question is or if I even have a question, its just <br/>
hard to let go of these kind of ingrained thoughts.</div>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s because we live in a school-driven society.  Our <br/>
society &quot;needs&quot; school in order to contribute to the economic status <br/>
of our society.  That&#39;s the mindset that we are put in.  Without <br/>
schools our society would fail because this is the only way in which <br/>
people can learn.  How else are we going to teach the masses if not <br/>
in schools?  Certainly they can&#39;t learn this stuff on their own!  (I <br/>
hope you are reading this dripping with sarcasm!) <br/>
<br/>
How did most of us &quot;learn math?&quot;  It was at school.  So we don&#39;t <br/>
know any other way of learning math.  Or science.  Or literature.  <br/>
Or economics.  Or history.  Or ART for that matter!  Very few of us <br/>
were given the freedom to learn these things for ourselves. To <br/>
explore them on our own and figure it all out on an &quot;as needed <br/>
basis.&quot;  I liken it much to the fact that we don&#39;t live in a <br/>
breastfeeding society.  If we did live in a breastfeeding society, <br/>
breastfeeding would be the norm and bottle feeding would be what <br/>
womyn did if they really truly couldn&#39;t breastfeed.  Mothers <br/>
wouldn&#39;t quit after 3 or 4 days because they were familiar with the <br/>
cycle of breastfeeding and that breastfeeding would get easier and <br/>
smoother after the first couple of days or weeks.  And they would <br/>
have support from their mothers, sisters, aunties, grandmothers, <br/>
girlfriends as well as the men in their lives because it was what <br/>
was *normal*<br/>
<br/>
What we are trying to accomplish with unschooling is &quot;not normal&quot;  <br/>
Abnormal if you wish to think of if that way.  Think what we would <br/>
have if we were truly an unschooling society (in that wonderful <br/>
utopia that we dream of LOL!)  Children would have all the creative <br/>
play and materials for creating art.  Shopping malls (if they even <br/>
exist in our version of utopia) would be built around large green <br/>
spaces where children could run and play and curl up under (or in) <br/>
trees while waiting for their mothers to try on another pair of <br/>
shoes (if we are even wearing shoes in our utopia LOL!)  Instead of <br/>
conversations at dinner like &quot;So what did you learn today at school, <br/>
Junior&quot; the parents and children alike would be sharing the joy of <br/>
their day.  And our society, somehow, would still thrive.  Video <br/>
games wouldn&#39;t be evil and television wouldn&#39;t be vile.  And there <br/>
might even be something worth watching on television!  :-D<br/>
<br/>
We wouldn&#39;t question whether our children were &quot;learning&quot; because we <br/>
would see them excel and create and thrive beyond just thriving!   <br/>
They would be living life to the fullest and they would feel <br/>
respected and honored by not only their parents but by society as a <br/>
whole.  Unfortunately, we don&#39;t live in an unschooling society.  We <br/>
live in a society that is geared to train our children to be ready <br/>
for school as soon as they are walking (if not sooner).  Kids forget <br/>
how to be kids.  <br/>
<br/>
It might help to know that kids don&#39;t need to sit and &quot;do math&quot; to <br/>
learn math.  They will learn math as they have a need for it and <br/>
many kids figure it out on their own.  I&#39;m astounded sometimes when <br/>
my kids ramble off something mathematical and I have to sit and <br/>
figure out if they are right or not (99,9% of the time they are).  <br/>
And I didn&#39;t teach it to them.  Not really.  I mean we counted <br/>
together and learned numbers and quantities, but I did very little <br/>
arithmetic with them.  They just figured it out because they had a <br/>
need to know a number and how to get that number.<br/>

I know what you are saying.  It is hard to let go of how we were<br/>
conditioned?  It might take time to unlearn or relearn that we CAN learn on<br/>
our own.  It&#39;s a process and may take time.  It was 13 years of programming.<br/>
It seems like when my brain takes one step forward in the process (towards<br/>
living an Unschooling lifestyle) my fears kick in and take me two steps<br/>
back.  It&#39;s hard for me to let go and trust that my children will learn what<br/>
they need to learn and that they will learn it in their own time.  I don&#39;t<br/>
have this trust because I was never trusted to learn on my own?  I feel<br/>
schizophrenic sometimes.  <br/>
