<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589999333">My 8 yr olds best friends parents and I are having &quot;issues&#39;, or I am having issues with them.  I <br/>

last few times we have gotten together i have left very unhappy.  The mom constantly calls <br/>

I want my kids to understand that words that are not nice can hurt, name calling, etc.  How <br/>

with out saying something.  The mom has also said to my younger daughter(who has certain <br/>
disabilities) that she(the mom) expects her(my D) to act her age, who is she to tell my <br/>
daughter what is right for her at 5, it may be different than what she expects from her 5yrold.   <br/>
My son(also 5) has potty training issues, not a big deal at home, he will get it when he gets it, <br/>
at their house it is not tolerated, again names.  She also believes in the &quot;let them duke it out&quot; <br/>
theory, I do not.  We want our kids to understand that you keep your hands off other peoples <br/>
bodies when you are upset.  And to respect other peoples personal space.  I am not a <br/>
confrontational person, and I would like to just run and hide, but i feel like my kids need to <br/>
know that I will protect them even from other Big People.  Am I over reacting, being too <br/>
protective?  How can I get my feelings accross with out having my kids lose their best friends. <br/>
Or would they be better off having different friends.  BTW their kids really are not horrible, for <br/>
the most part I enjoy them, but they are really &quot;contained&quot;.   I know I&#39;ve ranted a lot, but it <br/>
has been stewing. Help!?  Thanks Melanie in VT</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-891664545">You are definitely NOT overreacting!  Your kids should not be made to <br/>
feel bad for normal behavior.  You need to talk to this mom before it <br/>
happens again.  Have you said anything about it yet?  If not, then she <br/>
may not even know it is upsetting you.  She does not seem to have any <br/>
respect for your children as people if she is calling them names.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a confrontational person either, and I would be tempted to <br/>
just completely avoid a person like this, but if the friendships are <br/>
important to your children, you will have to be brave.  Your kids <br/>
should be able to trust you to stick up for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930572642">-Christy thanks, as lame as it is I guess I just needed someone to say I was not overreacting.  <br/>
Not many examples around here, and I seem to be standing up for my kids against a lot of <br/>
adults lately(ie the school, teachers, relatives) and am feeling really vulnerable.  Again <br/>
Thanks. I haven&#39;t said  anything directly, but in front of her I have (in a clear voice so she <br/>
would hear) explained to the kids that calling names is disrespectful and hurts.  But she <br/>
didn&#39;t catch on, so I will talk to her.  I have just been avoiding them for the last few days. <br/>

you to meet at your home or in a neutral place?<br/>
<br/>
And most certainly stand up for your children!  You have every right to do<br/>
that and if things don&#39;t change then you also have the right to remove them<br/>
from further negative situations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608631065">You are definitely not over-reacting!  Our kids depend on us to <br/>
protect them in situations where they can&#39;t protect themselves.  In <br/>
this other home, it is abundantly clear that the kids are not <br/>
respected and different rules apply to adults.  (I&#39;d like to see how <br/>
this mom would react if her kids started calling her names!)  <br/>
Therefore, it is clear that they need an adult advocate that, <br/>
hopefully, in this other mom&#39;s eyes would be on the same level as <br/>
her.  Very sad that you don&#39;t have to show respect to someone until <br/>
they reach a certain age (or size maybe).  I could go on and on.  <br/>
This is extremely sad to me.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>a way for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you to meet at your home or in a neutral place?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to agree, it might help to meet somewhere neutral or even at <br/>
your home.  In your home, you&#39;d be in charge, so to speak and your <br/>
kids could be safe from her.  Somewhere neutral might be even better, <br/>
then you wouldn&#39;t have the &quot;in my house ....&quot; kind of thing going on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And most certainly stand up for your children!  You have every <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lesa <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to agree again with Lesa, stand up for your children.  Talk to <br/>
the other mom, but remember you do have the option of helping your <br/>
children cultivate other friendships at the same time that your <br/>
trying to salvage these.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to be &quot;ugly&quot; about this.  You can be very sweet and <br/>
smile while your telling your child &quot;I&#39;m so sorry that such-and-such <br/>
doesn&#39;t respect you and feels like she has to call you names.&quot;  And <br/>
of course do this in front of her so she can hear and then address <br/>
her calmly and kindly and say that &quot;You know, we really try to show <br/>
our children how to respect others by treating them with respect.  If <br/>
you have something to say to my kids, please say it to me first and <br/>
we&#39;ll see if we can work it out.&quot;  Be creative.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have <br/>
plenty of opportunities to talk to this person.  But at some point, <br/>
if the discussions don&#39;t work, you&#39;ll have to decide if this is <br/>
something that brings peace and joy to your home or if it actually is <br/>
hurtful for your children and you.<br/>
<br/>
In our home, we try to meet everyone&#39;s needs, not just the <br/>
children&#39;s.  I&#39;ve said it before, we are family-oriented, not child-<br/>
oriented or parent-oriented.  We try very hard to make something work <br/>
for everybody in our family.  It is hard sometimes, but this means <br/>
that if something is bad for you that is important to discuss and try <br/>
to work through also.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>
Terri (who just read this to her son and he totally agrees, stand up <br/>
for your kids)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102701231">Have you talked with your children and asked them how they feel about <br/>
things?  Do they leave upset and unhappy also, even a little?  Do they <br/>
know or notice that you are upset about it?  How do the feel about being <br/>
called names?  Do they notice it?  How upset would they be if these <br/>
relationships dwindled or ceased?  Are there other friends that they <br/>
would like to spend more time with?  Do you have any local <br/>
un/homeschooling groups to get together with and meet like minded people <br/>
in your area?<br/>
<br/>
I ask these questions to make sure that you know all sides of the <br/>
situation.  I, personally, do not believe that you are over reacting.  <br/>
The other mom seems to be a person that I would not like to be around.  <br/>
If you feel that these relationships need to continue than I believe you <br/>
have a need, and a right, to discuss your concerns with her.  I know you <br/>
will try to make it a nonconfrontational discussion but even if it has <br/>
to be a confrontation, or becomes one, I think this woman needs to know <br/>
that her actions are inappropriate.  If she decides that she can not <br/>
abide her children continuing a relationship with your children, that <br/>
would convince me that this is a family you are better off without.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I would deeply evaluate the relationships that the children <br/>
have and consider reducing the contact.  If your children really want to <br/>
get together with them, then invite the children to come to your house <br/>
or meet at a park or some other neutral ground.  I would very much <br/>
reduce the time you or your children spend at their house. <br/>
<br/>
All just my opinion,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121394121">-my oldest and I have talked about the situation. She noticed I wa upset the last time.  I gave <br/>
her a &quot; what would you do if a person you knew...&quot; and she said &quot; I would tell them how I felt, <br/>
and if they did it again then you shouldn&#39;t let us go to S&#39;s house anymore&quot;  She had noticed it <br/>
too, and didn&#39;t like it, knew who I was talking about.  My son doesn&#39;t like to go to their <br/>
house, so we have their son over to our house.  We meet in neutral places (the local PS) b/c <br/>
our 8yrolds take Tae Kwon Do there(not school related, just using the space).   Our 5&#39;s are in <br/>
the same preschool(very liberal) and so we see them there too.  I have stopped letting the <br/>
kids go to their house w/o me, and have limited time with them.  In fact the last time we <br/>
were together my 5&#39;s and I left where they were to &quot;walk&quot; and they followed.  Our area is very <br/>
rural, my little family, and their  preschool teacher are the only vegetarians, only AP parents, <br/>
etc, in the area.  We have found an unschooling group in the area, and are trying to hook up <br/>
with them.  Thanks for all your advice and your opinions, I just need to jump in and do it.  <br/>
Meanwhile the other 8 is here visiting, and we are having fun!! Thanks Melanie in Vt-<br/>
