I don&#39;t think Jon has a passion just yet. He likes to fish. He hangs out<br/>
with older boys who have a car, boat, etc. and can go places. He goes<br/>
fishing with my husband, too. He seems to have listened well to people<br/>
telling him he is not smart and knows nothing. He has a hard time tryng<br/>
anything because he predetermines his failure at it, so why bother<br/>
trying. <br/>
We gently encourage him to try something he may like. We encourage him<br/>
to take one small step. I do agree that he is in angst. We talk about<br/>
that. He is seeking to fit in to &quot;make it all better.&quot; The only trouble<br/>
with that is that change comes from the inside. That is the tricky part.<br/>
Sometimes it seems like he gets stuck in the blame game. It seems he is<br/>
stuck taking it out on me because he trusts me and I am handy. Then he<br/>
will apologize afterwards. It still feels bad to me. I want with all my<br/>
heart to see him succeed. I will stick by him and keep encouraging him.<br/>
Eventually he will find a passion. I didn&#39;t find one until my 30&#39;s.<br/>

Why don&#39;t you think that fishing is a passion?  If that is what he <br/>
likes to do, couldn&#39;t you go fishing with him one day, let him teach <br/>
you about what it is he does, maybe take him fishing somewhere he <br/>
hasn&#39;t been.  You could even invite one of his friends to come if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t trust your motive.  Even if you don&#39;t see the value in <br/>
fishing, and even if he&#39;s only doing it as an escape, it may help <br/>
your relationship.  <br/>

Sounds like fishing is a passion to him. My suggestions would be, <br/>
ask him if he would teach you how to fish, take him to fishing <br/>
rodeos (we have them here), get online with him and find fishing <br/>
books at Amazon or half.com. In other words, let him know that you <br/>
take his fishing passion seriously and that you&#39;re willing to do <br/>
whatever it takes to help him pursue the fishing. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe fishing will become a lifestyle for him, maybe fishing is his <br/>
escape, maybe he just loves the quietness of fishing ( LOTS of <br/>
thinking goes on when a person is fishing), maybe he&#39;ll someday <br/>
create a television show around his fishing technique or maybe he&#39;ll <br/>
immerse himself totally into fishing and it&#39;ll lead to something <br/>
else. No way to know just yet. <br/>
<br/>
Would you learn how to handle the boat so that the two of you could <br/>
go off together and fish? What an incredibly spiritual adventure <br/>
that could be. Mom and Jon fishing quietly on the water. Sounds <br/>
heavenly to me.<br/>
<br/>
What about hosting a fishing party for Jon and one or two of his <br/>
friends? My dad took me and 5 other teenage girls crabbing from his <br/>
boat one time. It&#39;s one of my fondest childhood memories. And he <br/>
really shone with patience. Imagine SIX teen girls in a boat in the <br/>
middle of the water! <br/>
<br/>
And there are so many ways to fish, so many different types of fish <br/>
to catch. Fishing from the boat, the shore, deepsea fishing, etc. My <br/>
dad has a million passions, but fishing is number one with him.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of looking for things that you might feel he SHOULD have a <br/>
passion about, go with the one he already has. Fishing is an art and <br/>
if more teen boys could sit still long enough to fish, they&#39;d <br/>
probably be a lot more content. It&#39;s a physical and cerebral <br/>
activity.<br/>
