My 16yos ( unschooled since he was 9.), got up, got dressed, made himself breakfast and made his lunch.<br/>
He stuck his head in my room to &quot;wake me up&quot; at 8 :10 AM to take him to work.<br/>
All this on a rainy kind of day when it feels soooo good to sleep in.<br/>
We passed school buses on the road and I was reminded<br/>
how many wonderful years we have had without 8 hours away from home, 5 days a week!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 15 yr old has a summer job, this will be his second<br/>
year. He worked as a volunteer at 13 and last year<br/>
they decided to pay him. It is working for a not for<br/>
profit music series, what he has learned there is way<br/>
beyond any amount of money they could pay him. He was<br/>
(and is) their only under 20 yr old. He does most<br/>
everything, from roadie to toilet cleaner to security<br/>
guard (he even got to guard Davy Jones once from women<br/>
trying to get backstage!!). He works with other staff,<br/>
park rangers, and the public working long hours and<br/>
loves every minute. He is also a volunteer at the Y<br/>
who will be on staff after the summer (we&#39;re too busy<br/>
now). I really think the key is to get out there and<br/>
advocate for them until you can get someone to see it<br/>
your way or you wear them down. There is no legal<br/>
reason to stop your son from working at GameStop, just<br/>
the manager&#39;s perception.It&#39;s all about changing<br/>
perceptions...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567088683">My son is working at a local pick your own farm.  <br/>
The farm is family owned with a very friendly environment.<br/>
They have had good experiences with homeschoolers.   <br/>
<br/>
We stuck our head in the door during the fall season last year and handed in his application.<br/>
Then we started calling in April. <br/>
One of his greatest hiring points was that he could work when school kids could not! <br/>
Strawberry season started 2 weeks ago.  He will be able to work in the busiest time in the fall...<br/>
October pumpkin time!<br/>
<br/>
The volunteer thing is a good way to get your foot in the door.  Maybe your son could volunteer to help<br/>
sort stock/ organize shelves for the local game store once a week for a few months.  I think summer is hardest because all the teens and college kids are out looking for spending money.  Once fall hits, spots might open.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-811823908">My 15 yo daughter also started out as a volunteer.  She works about 10 <br/>
hours a week providing child care at our church.  She starting hanging <br/>
out in there instead of going to Sunday School when she was 12.  She <br/>
has always loved little kids.  They had 2 college aged kids working <br/>
and whenever one of them was sick they would pay her to fill in.  When <br/>
one of them quit they couldn&#39;t find an over 18 person so they hired <br/>
Liz at 13.  Volunteering at something you love is definitely the way <br/>
to go for anyone.  Even if you don&#39;t make any money you are doing what <br/>
you like to do with other people who like it too.  Can&#39;t go wrong <br/>
there.<br/>
