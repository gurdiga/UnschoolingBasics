<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868417241">&quot;(Don&#39;t you hate how people who<br/>
have no kids all seem to be such experts on what parents should do?)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not necessarily!!<br/>
John Holt was an &quot;expert&quot; on how children learned best and he never<br/>
had children of his own.:) I think parents should really listen to<br/>
what John Holt shared.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to weigh ideas and philosophies AND life experience when<br/>
choosing to hear an opinion. Some childless people are FAR more<br/>
qualified to be around children than many parents.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, my SIL who is childless is SCARY but has a million opinions<br/>
about how people should raise children.<br/>
