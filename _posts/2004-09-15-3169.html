<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038570036">&quot;also, does anyone have any experience in doing murals? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some. I just painted some a cute mural at Unity Church in Pensacola <br/>
and it&#39;s <br/>
being hammered by hurricane Ivan at the moment...so I may be <br/>
painting another <br/>
before long. ugh.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m safely tucked away in a Marriott in Tallahassee, waiting for <br/>
Ivan to do it&#39;s <br/>
worst. Pensacola is in the circle of the most devastating winds and <br/>
damage...my <br/>
home may not be liveable by morning. I&#39;m really stressed sitting <br/>
here wondering, <br/>
but also relieved that everything I care most about is right here <br/>
with me.:)<br/>
My children and dh, my photos and cherished keepsakes, plus my four <br/>
rattie girls <br/>
and Sierra&#39;s hamsters...we&#39;re all safe, dry and enjoying the pool <br/>
immensely.<br/>
<br/>
So about murals...I use acrylics always, usually the best of the <br/>
inexpensive <br/>
brands. My suggestion is to get some giant rolls of paper and hang <br/>
them up on <br/>
the wall and try your hand at some LARGE stuff. It&#39;s fun and it <br/>
helps you get <br/>
the feel of painting something on a larger scale. The only thing <br/>
I&#39;ve really <br/>
noticed that&#39;s different is you have to stand back from it a bit <br/>
more often, to <br/>
make sure you&#39;re getting the perspective right. It&#39;s easy to feel <br/>
it&#39;s going <br/>
great...but you&#39;re too close.<br/>
It&#39;s really pretty easy though. There&#39;s something very freeing about <br/>
doing BIG, <br/>
swooping designs on a wall. I love murals.<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re working from an existing work of art make a grid on the mural<br/>
wall so sizes transfer proportionately.   If you&#39;re creating the work as<br/>
you go a grid still helps keep people or animals or buildings in<br/>
proportion to other people, animals or buildings.  <br/>
<br/>
Just make the grid using a chalk line, it works great.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270725737">Hi all,<br/>
 <br/>
Sending good vibes and prayers for those in Ivan&#39;s path.  We got nibbled on by Tropical Storm Jean all day yesterday.  Lots of downed trees (which always makes me a little sad.)  I saw an almond tree uprooted this morning.  :(    In my own yard, we watched avacados and passion fruit fly from the trees but the trees themselves weren&#39;t damaged that I can see.  My bananas are hurt though-I don&#39;t know that we can save it.  :(  But we are all safe and healthy.  :)  We still have no power or running water (sneaking in from the computer at work where we have a generator).  ;)<br/>
 <br/>
We actually ended up having a lovely unschooling day since nobody could work and we all just got to hang out.  We played board games and sketched how the trees looked bending to 60mph winds.  At night we played cribbage by candlelight.  All in all and the sadness around us aside-it was a nice day.<br/>
 <br/>
Will be back online asap-miss you all.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-548585423">---Hi, have just recently joined this group and I am loving it:)  Was<br/>
going to wait to post (getting so much out of just reading)....just<br/>
had to reply to the post from Puerto Rico - we live in neighboring St.<br/>
Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands and also experienced tropical storm<br/>
Jeanne with minor problems: power out for a day, a few trees down and<br/>
some flooding.  I have to admit that I feel just like you Jonni-Ann in<br/>
regards to hurricanes (you phrased it so well!).  <br/>
A little about us, I have lived on St.Croix for 15 years, dh here for<br/>
20 years.  We have one ds age 6 and another ds age 3.  We have been<br/>
homeschooling for two years.  <br/>

I am so glad we found this group!  <br/>

&gt; Yipes!  Stay safe down there, too, Jonni-Ann!  Whew, hurricanes are <br/>
&gt; powerful and plentiful this season.  Do you ever get used to them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have tornados up here in MI, but nothing compared with a big ol&#39; <br/>
&gt; hurricane.  Although, my great-great-grandfather was killed by a <br/>
&gt; &#39;twister&#39; in Iowa back in the 1800&#39;s.  The dummy went outside on his <br/>
&gt; porch to watch it coming across the fields.  His famous last words were <br/>
&gt; &quot;Here she comes!&quot; and there he went.  LOL<br/>
