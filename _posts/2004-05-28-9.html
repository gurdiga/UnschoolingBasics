<div id="ygrps-yiv-602699818">&quot; I watched, chuckling, as Ren got this unschooling &quot;thang&quot; a few <br/>
years ago. Her &quot;reckoning&quot; is all recorded at unschooling.com----<br/>
well, if it&#39;s been saved. They&#39;re cleaning up a bit over there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And believe me, I gave these ladies plenty to chuckle about prior to <br/>
my &quot;conversion&quot;.:)<br/>
I&#39;ve saved some of my &quot;reckoning&quot; if anyone ever needs a good laugh.<br/>
