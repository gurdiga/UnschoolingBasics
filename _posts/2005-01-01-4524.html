<div id="ygrps-yiv-154536800">&quot;I understand that you don&#39;t have to test but don&#39;t you have to do<br/>
some sort of yearly review?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, you don&#39;t.<br/>
You can if you choose.<br/>
There are basically three ways to meet the law in Florida:<br/>
Register with the school district and a) test at the end of the <br/>
school year or b)have a registered teacher review your portfolio. <br/>
The teacher is chosen by YOU, the parent, so anyone with a Florida <br/>
certificate can do this.<br/>
Choice #3 is to sign up with an umbrella school of your choosing. <br/>
Again, the school is YOUR choice, so pick one that doesn&#39;t have <br/>
requirements. Alternative Education Institute charges something like <br/>
$15 per year and only requires the registration form <br/>
and &quot;attendance&quot; (which can simply be an email).<br/>
<br/>
Florida is an easy state, but you need to understand the laws here <br/>
and just what your choices are. I have a more detailed description <br/>
of the law and some good links at the homeschool registry:<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s under the Florida &quot;Wiki&quot;.<br/>
