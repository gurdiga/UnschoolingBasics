My 2  year old<br/>
turns three in October, so this is something we might be  interested in.  <br/>

Do you have a Parks and Recreation facility near you? Or in a neighboring  <br/>
town? They are generally cheaper than a private dance or gymnastics class  and <br/>
are more flexible, less rigid, that kind of thing. Good luck! we&#39;re looking  <br/>
for Mexican dancing and tap over here...no luck so far...(Julian wants to be in  <br/>
a class with boys and at age 4, that seems to be sadly, nearly impossible :( <br/>
) <br/>
