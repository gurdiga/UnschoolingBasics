<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560373886">To say I needed yesterday is an understatment...it was so amazing. We <br/>
have been deschooling since July..Before July we were doing school at <br/>
home/unit studies and that sort of thing. Very structured , very <br/>
organized...it was horriable. It was like we were all going against <br/>
the grain of what we truly wanted and needed to do. It sucked and our <br/>
house was full to the brim with resentment, anger and fustration from <br/>
every angle....my poor hubby coming home from work must have wanted <br/>
to stay away....*sigh*...remebering back...everything was such a <br/>
fight...going to bed was a fight, eating was a fight...sitting down <br/>
was a fight...going out to play was a fight...It was <br/>
horriable...anyway I am sure you understand where I am coming <br/>
from..and I share this simply becuase I wanted to give you all some <br/>
background. We went to unschooling out of pure exhaustion on <br/>
everyones parts and it was the best descion we ever made for our <br/>
family..though we are def still in the deschool mode...were getting <br/>
there...sooooo uesterday was amazing...We woke up together after <br/>
cuddling in bed for about 2 hours...we all got our brekkie...The <br/>
oldest helped me get everyone together...we sat and ate <br/>
together...watched the snow...it was a gorgeous morning out...I <br/>
jumped on the net to check my email, Ash(5yo)went to play zelda on <br/>
the gamecube, Tyler(8yo) was off doing all sorts of different things <br/>
and Heather(3yo) was playing house with the Guinea Pigs. It was <br/>
really calm...THEN the fun really begain...my son came down deciding <br/>
he wanted a job...He didt want a paper route or anything that other <br/>
people do...so he came up with dog walking! He sat at the computer <br/>
and made posters , figuring out how to put them together with <br/>
pictures and everything, how much to charge (he came up with 5 bucks <br/>
an hour), his phone number (which I didnt even know he knew!) and <br/>
printed them out...he took them around our condo taping them up...he <br/>
was so excited...upon returning home he decided that he had to have <br/>
some kind of page that he could write everything down , so he got out <br/>
a notebook and wrote down name, date, name of dog, unit you live in, <br/>
times....it was amazing to see...I helped him come up with a few more <br/>
questions like temperment of the dog, that sort of thing. It was <br/>
great! He then sat there thinking, and asked &quot;what happens when I get <br/>
to many dogs&quot;..I jsut sort of said, I am not sure..what do you <br/>
think...he said..I need empolyees..lol...I walked in on <br/>
him &quot;interviewing&quot; three of the neighbourhood kids , one of them <br/>
being his sister...It was the cutest thing...It was neat too because <br/>
he was telling his &quot;employees&quot; that he was going to get paid 5.00 an <br/>
hour so he would give them half which would be 2.50 an hour and if <br/>
they only worked for an hour, it would be 1.25! I was blown <br/>
away...where did he learn that!! One of the reasons I wanted to <br/>
homeschool in the begining was becuase I wanted to know what and how <br/>
my children were learning....They dont go to school so where did he <br/>
get this stuff? lol..His sister decided that she would do it, IF and <br/>
only if she got to keep 4.00! He also decided that he was going to <br/>
approach his dad and ask for a loan for his businees, so that he <br/>
could buy his own leash! lol...it was amazing. He didnt get any calls <br/>
yet, but he is already planning his next business venture.  The way <br/>
his mind was working, it really made me see that he truly has a <br/>
business mind...thats what makes him tick. To make a great day even <br/>
better we went out and played in the snow together....shovled our <br/>
front walk and driveway, giggled and had a great time. Heather (3yo) <br/>
and I came back in and made hot cocoa and she went down to watch some <br/>
shows...and I got some houswork done...We ended up having some of the <br/>
neighbourhood kids over, and one stayed for dinner. After dinner, the <br/>
kids cleaned the table without being asked...my daughter helped with <br/>
dishes without being asked, and preceeded to tell me stories about <br/>
everything and anything...She is quite the story teller...Back in <br/>
june I wouldnt have &quot;let&quot; her help with dishes I would have told her <br/>
to go find something on her own to do...*sigh*...so we sat and did <br/>
dishes and she told me stories...I listened. It was awesome.  After <br/>
that was all said and done , the kids sat down and drew pictures <br/>
together while I tried to fix our blasted computer (I had to re DL <br/>
windows XP a few weeks ago and ever since then we don&#39;t have sound. I <br/>
know we have an onboard soundcard....HELP..LOL). Tyler then went on <br/>
to knitting his wallet he is making. He learnt how to change colours <br/>
yesterday amoungst all the other things we were doing. Very cool. Its <br/>
neat to see him sitting on the floor cross legged in combat pants <br/>
knitting...*smiles*. I gave up on the computer and we decided to play <br/>
monoply...Tyler (8yo) was the banker, Ashleigh (5yo) was the property <br/>
person and Heather(3yo) was Heather *smiles*...it was amazing...Tyler <br/>
was making change like a pro..helping his sisters make it <br/>
too...Ashleigh was able to give the right properties to people <br/>
ebcuase she organized them by colour and then matched the words on <br/>
the card to the words on the board..her doing , not mine. Heather <br/>
sorted the money by colour. It was so incrediable...Daddy came home, <br/>
the game went away. We spent some time talking together while daddy <br/>
ate his supper and tried the candy we made two days ago. He loved <br/>
them both..the kids then dissappeared upstairs and Graham and I sat <br/>
and talked about the property were looking into buying...when we <br/>
looked at the time it was 10pm, Graham had been up since 4 am and was <br/>
zonked and so was I. We headed upstairs to see what the kids were <br/>
doing...they were all found in Tylers bed cuddled together sound <br/>
asleep....*sigh*...what a perfect end to an amazing day...and the <br/>
best thing....my husband then looked at me and said, &quot;you know this <br/>
unschooling thing just might work&quot;. My reply, &quot;I was hoping you would <br/>
say that&quot; . We might have a long way to go with this deschooling <br/>
process, but proof is in the puddin hunny.<br/>
Amoung all of this we had discussions abotu everything from weather, <br/>
friends, farming, animals, colours...sooo many things...amazing.<br/>
<br/>
happy were doing this<br/>
