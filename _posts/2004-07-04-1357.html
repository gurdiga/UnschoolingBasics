<br/>
And thanks, Kelly, for that superb introduction...funny how you couldn&#39;t<br/>
think of that at the last conference when you introduced me as a &quot;big, fat<br/>
poopyhead.&quot;  Now Kathryn is thinking I should be a big, fat poopyhead, too.<br/>
<br/>
And more on John Holt...<br/>

&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future,<br/>
it<br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn<br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be<br/>
able<br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>

Syndi&#39;s quote again proves how I feel about John Holt...I open a John Holt<br/>
book and I think, &quot;I have nothing more to say that this man hasn&#39;t already<br/>
said so gently and sweetly...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hope he&#39;s feelin&#39; the LOVE post-mortem!<br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>
