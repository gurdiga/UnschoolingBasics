<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518711647">Hello!<br/>
We started unschooling about 4 months ago.  Obviously we are deschooling<br/>
ourselves big time.  My ds, 5 years, never went to school... he wants to do<br/>
what he wants... not what some one else wants :-)  clue to mama... there has<br/>
got to be a better way... so here we are.<br/>
<br/>
My dd is 2 years old.  My son is big on lego and privacy... he mostly wants<br/>
at least 8-10 hours of time alone in a room with his lego per week!  And<br/>
this is new to us... and while we were moving house and country twice over<br/>
in the past year....a easy to fix child proof gate was my solution until<br/>
now....<br/>
<br/>
My 2 year old is almost as tall as a 4 year old and has that kind of<br/>
strength as well... so she does not take kindly to the gate any more... so<br/>
we now let ds close the room door when he needs to.  And i made sure that i<br/>
would stay with my 2 year old during her sadness of being kept out.  Slowly<br/>
she has come to accept her brother&#39;s need for time... adn has found her own<br/>
ways to play then.  Also... we plan to give her a child&#39;s gate for our room<br/>
(a sleep only room with some toys).. so she can control entry to that<br/>
room:-)  I think thats the least we can do..so she feels like she can<br/>
control access to a space like her brother can.<br/>
<br/>
And interestingly ds will some times come out after 10 minutes.. and play<br/>
with dd till she seems past her sadness and then go back in again!  how<br/>
glorious to see them empathize and connect... i&#39;m so glad we started<br/>
unschooling.... and parenting in an unconditional way... it allows for the<br/>
child to always feel safe :-) and hence empowers them.<br/>
<br/>
Also.... when dd wants to go into ds&#39;s room... i accompany her... and show<br/>
her how to handle lego creations or some other delicate sculpture that ds<br/>
has made.  Usually she is satisfied to pick up some blocks and a few lego<br/>
pieces from there and bring them into the kitchen or front room with me.<br/>
(She has enough toys outside ds&#39;s room but is constantly thinking there must<br/>
be a spotted dinosaur or something in there we&#39;re hiding from her  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you find something that works for both of them.<br/>
