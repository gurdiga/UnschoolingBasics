<div id="ygrps-yiv-464556479">I always thought that I had to spend time with each one of my <br/>
children on an individual basis EVERY day in order for unschooling <br/>
to work.  I am seeing that just as when they are babies, children go <br/>
through &quot;growth spurts&quot; in their learning.  I am learning to go with <br/>
it when one of my six kids is in &quot;spurt&quot; and devote that time to <br/>
learning right alongside them.  My daughter got an acoustic guitar <br/>
and a sewing machine for Christmas and her birthday so she is very <br/>
excited about learning how to do both.  And I am excited to help and <br/>
learn too!  My eldest son is not currently at a learning spurt right <br/>
now.  That&#39;s okay.  He doesn&#39;t have to be.  He is still learning by <br/>
playing and doing all those normal kid things.  I think I am finally <br/>
getting to be all right with this.<br/>
<br/>
Any feedback, would like to hear of your own personal experiences <br/>
with this!<br/>

That&#39;s really kewl.:)<br/>
<br/>
I agree that my kids seem to go in spurts with things. They&#39;ll want <br/>
to try a new class, or learn about something for a while, then they <br/>
seem to back off and just &quot;be&quot; for a while.<br/>
If I think about it, I tend to be the same way. I think kids <br/>
especially, need down time to sort of process all the new things <br/>
they learn. It can be months of processing, but when they come out <br/>
of that cycle, they&#39;re ready to eat up the world again!<br/>
It&#39;s cool how that all works and to see truly natural learning in <br/>
action.<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that when my kids come out of a &quot;down&quot; cycle, they seem <br/>
to have lept forward by many months. Something that was hard to <br/>
grasp seems to make sense almost overnight. It&#39;s like the needed <br/>
rest for development.<br/>

 <br/>
I think this is really important----and I think you&#39;ve &quot;got&quot; it!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
*I* have waves myself----times when I&#39;m busy and almost OVERdoing it. Then  <br/>
I&#39;ll have periods of veg-time when I need to sit and read or watch TV. That&#39;s  <br/>
usually followed by another intensive spurt when there are not enough hours in <br/>
 the day for all I want to do.<br/>
 <br/>
Seeing it---and acknowledging it in your kids is great.<br/>
 <br/>
I think being OK with it is a big step! Congratulations!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347322455">Does anyone else notice a change with the weather? When fall came and <br/>
the weather cooled off--and we saw the sun a lot less--I&#39;d have sworn <br/>
my kids were part bear...they were practically hibernating.<br/>
<br/>
Now my ds is back in sponge mode and demanding large amounts of new <br/>
info on a daily basis.<br/>
