<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923360719">hi. <br/>
i am new here, as you can tell, and i am interested in unschooling. <br/>
i was first interested in it after reading &quot;the teenage liberation <br/>
handbook&quot; this past fall. i, in my excitment, threw together a <br/>
proposal and showed it to my parents.<br/>
<br/>
of course, they were completely against the idea. with my <br/>
suggestion, they read &quot;the teenage liberation handbook&quot;, let the <br/>
idea mull over for a couple weeks and again said no. but instead of <br/>
sending me back to public school that year, i ended in a liberal <br/>
private school for my first year of highschool.<br/>
<br/>
as the year is winding down, i have looked into the topic of <br/>
unschooling again because my school is very dissatisfying <br/>
academically (it&#39;s been two trimesters and i think i&#39;ve learned <br/>
about three things). i don&#39;t want to go back to my old public school <br/>
where i learned more but the only things on students minds are sex, <br/>
drugs, and cheerleading/football. i also don&#39;t want to go to a <br/>
preppy private school. so, unschooling seems like the best choice <br/>
out of my options so far. <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve been putting together another, more in-depth proposal for my <br/>
parents, but do you have any other suggestions so my parents will <br/>
agree to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
japaneseprint.</div>

Have they read John Taylor Gatto&#39;s Dumbing Us Down or The Underground <br/>
History of American Education?<br/>
<br/>
That might be a good way to get them on board.<br/>
