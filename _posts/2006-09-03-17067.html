<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587250063">&quot;today I&#39;d like to ask all of you if you go to work? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, both dh and I work.  He is a full-time realtor and I work<br/>
part-time for MAC cosmetics as a makeup artist. I also freelance jobs<br/>
on the side occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve worked around each other&#39;s schedules for the last few years. <br/>
Occasionally, our older children would watch the younger one&#39; during<br/>
any  gap in our schedules. I don&#39;t like asking them to babysit, but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t happen very often.  <br/>
<br/>
The ages of my children really affects my ability to work....having<br/>
older kids has helped make it possible. I love my work, but it does<br/>
get hectic to work around each other consistently. In the past it was<br/>
pretty easy for dh to flow around my schedule (he ran his own decking<br/>
company in Pensacola) but now that he&#39;s doing realty, it&#39;s going to<br/>
get challenging. I can&#39;t count on him to always be here.<br/>
<br/>
So...it&#39;s probably good that as he&#39;s starting to get busier, I&#39;m going<br/>
back to 12 hours per week. <br/>
<br/>
The point is, it can work out just fine with a little creativity and<br/>
perseverance.:)  One of our best friends is a single mum that started<br/>
an internet business and is doing great with that.  There are creative<br/>
ways to make money and unschool.<br/>
<br/>
I love my work as it&#39;s a big part of creative expression for me. I get<br/>
paid well for what I do and I meet a ton of interesting people. I&#39;d be<br/>
doing this even if I didn&#39;t get paid (though probably not for another<br/>
company).<br/>
