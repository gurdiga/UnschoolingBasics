<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935125606">This is (another) Marcia from MA<br/>
<br/>
The comments about food and control have sounded very familiar to me...and I<br/>
agree with everything suggested about ease of access to a good assortment of<br/>
healthy but appealing food.  (See below)<br/>
This is long...I have thought a lot about all of this, recently.<br/>
<br/>
But the most important journey I have had is...that it is all the SAME<br/>
conversation about the control.   I am learning about letting go...in every<br/>
area of my relationship with my son (11, just out of school this last<br/>
November).  The journey about encouraging him to take responsibility for his<br/>
own choices...about food and EVERYTHING else...is part and parcel with his<br/>
journey of de-schooling.  I have had to let go of my fear (which makes me<br/>
&quot;need&quot; to control things) about his future, and trust both/each of us, in<br/>
the present.  I often need to stop and redirect myself...but at least I am<br/>
catching myself more quickly, now!<br/>
<br/>
He is slowly beginning to initiate more calmly and easily...letting go of<br/>
his anxiety and stuckness about being &quot;told what to do&quot; in school and<br/>
elsewhere.  I sometimes give him my opinion/remind him of a notion we feel<br/>
strongly about in our family, if I think that he may have missed something<br/>
about the bigger picture...but I let him know that, ultimately, it is up to<br/>
him.  And there are ongoing conversations with his Dad and me (often at<br/>
night, in bed, sort of debriefing).  I am blessed to have a husband who is<br/>
not only on board...but working at home - although he is in school full time<br/>
at the moment, on top of his office schedule...a little nuts around here -<br/>
he is as involved with hands-on unschool family learning as possible.<br/>
<br/>
We occasionally revisit the idea that he is now in charge of what and<br/>
when...and he is relishing being able to read and play as much as he likes.<br/>
Some days I do suggest changes in the flow...to encourage there being a mix<br/>
of physical activity and mental stimulus, varied visual opportunity and<br/>
hands on stuff to &quot;stir the pot&quot; and not be stuck, inadvertently.   I invite<br/>
him to do things with me: make pottery/play with clay - my work, cook,<br/>
garden, ride bikes, walk, play games - chess, Scrabble, Equate,<br/>
Boggle....sometimes he joins me and other times, not.  This helps him feel<br/>
the difference in his body and mind as we explore things together.  I am<br/>
learning about sharing and teaching without controlling...a challenge for<br/>
me!  And I throw in a bit of Brain Gym activities to keep integrating the<br/>
hemispheres.<br/>
<br/>
He now knows how this way (unschooling) is different from school<br/>
particularly because...&quot;they&quot; used to make all the decisions (this could be<br/>
said to be easier) but that the cost of this is having to do what &quot;they &quot;<br/>
think is a good idea when &quot;they&quot; tell you to....they have the responsibility<br/>
for all of the decisions.  Being unschoolers REQUIRES (and therefore can be<br/>
seen as harder!) a new level of being responsible for one&#39;s own<br/>
decisions/choices.  These are the most important lessons!  This impacts<br/>
everything in life...how well we do at having friends, learning skills,<br/>
being successful at it ALL!  Yes, we as parents help facilitate...but the<br/>
initiation and follow through comes from the child!  And the only way this<br/>
can happen is if we grownups get out of the way and trust our children to<br/>
&quot;do it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
De-schooling is very similar to de-junk fooding, and letting go of<br/>
controlling electronics (for example).  There is a period of trusting the<br/>
child to make the RIGHT mistakes and learn about themselves and the world<br/>
along the way.  They also learn to TRUST us to: 1) do what we say we are<br/>
going to do; 2) really let them make their own choices...REALLY!  This<br/>
removes the need to be sneaky and greedy about things that may have been<br/>
available under huge strictures previously.  It takes time to get used to<br/>
this shift!  This is not to say that we have no opinions or that we say<br/>
nothing...we absolutely want our &quot;family culture&quot; to guide all of us...and<br/>
if we &quot;walk our talk&quot;...lead by example, as another said earlier...then<br/>
there is value in the journey.  I believe we all know that the journey IS<br/>
the important part...not the destination!<br/>
<br/>
Our food issues are a bit less extreme because I have always had them eat<br/>
some of everything our whole family is having, even if things are not as<br/>
spicy/flavored as before children!  And I offered them the alternative to<br/>
have whole grain cereal (we have a family policy that they must have at<br/>
least two kinds together!) if they still wanted more to eat after having had<br/>
some of the meals they found less desirable.  I have always baked most our<br/>
bread (yay, bread machines!) and often make other baked goods...all with<br/>
whole wheat pastry flour, other whole grains (write to me about the BEST and<br/>
easiest way to make yummy brown rice, and my favorite homemade pancake mix)<br/>
and so on.<br/>
<br/>
But mostly we have always talked about the wholesomeness of whole foods (and<br/>
unwholesomeness of food additives - synthetic colors, flavorings and<br/>
preservatives)...how things are made/grown/and have involved the children in<br/>
gardening, butchering, baking and cooking.  They go through phases of<br/>
interest and enthusiasm.  We are very healthy as a family (my husband&#39;s<br/>
being a chiropractor and giving us all regular care helps a great deal, I am<br/>
sure!), but we have stressed our belief that we stay healthy because &quot;you<br/>
are what you eat!&quot;   I share ideas such as lemonade being quite pretty with<br/>
just a tiny dash of beet juice...(no, you cannot taste it!)...and eventually<br/>
getting them to enjoy beets along with me.  The pink lemonade sells better<br/>
at their lemonade stands!  My kids have been seen reading candy wrappers and<br/>
refusing goodies at events because of the garish colors, etc!   I stress<br/>
lots of fruit and protein sources.  I usually have a banana (or other quick)<br/>
bread made, an extra in the freezer, and everyone loves this with cream<br/>
cheese on it!  Frozen banana chunks in the freezer make great smoothies<br/>
(with other fruit or a hit of chocolate syrup), too...leftover smoothies<br/>
make for easy, more interesting frozen pops, too.<br/>
<br/>
There are also really good alternatives to most &quot;junk food&quot;<br/>
nowadays...Newman&#39;s cookies, and Barbara&#39;s Puffs, Annie&#39;s Cheese Popcorn etc<br/>
etc.  Belonging to a whole foods coop is also a great place to meet like<br/>
minded eaters AND homeschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
I have grown immensely since we made the shift to<br/>
homeschool/unschooling...and it has naturally expanded the current direction<br/>
of our family...all in about seven months (with help from many friends).<br/>
Amazing to me, and so &quot;right&quot; for us.<br/>

now on!)<br/>
