we go back to the way we ate before?&quot; LOL! Meaning, that she wanted me<br/>
to tell her what to eat again! She said she didn&#39;t feel as good as she<br/>

happy to limit the amount of &quot;junk food&quot; that we have in the house, if<br/>
that would help her (because money is an issue when it comes to buying<br/>
whatever food they want, and I&#39;d prefer to spend our money on the<br/>
foods that provide the most nutrition). But I can see her now learning<br/>
firsthand how different foods make her feel!<br/>

ME what to eat, Mommy.&quot; :D I received a HUGE hug from her when I told<br/>
her she could watch TV whenever she wanted. On my part, it has felt<br/>
very freeing to let go and stop expecting my children to behave like<br/>
mini-me&#39;s. I feel closer to them, and more open to who they  truly are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696263487">I have had a similar experience in that I have finally also let go of trying to control what they eat - I have 13 1/2 year old twin girls.  I was totally upfront with them about it; I also often share things with them that I read on this list - they are in 100% agreement!  And whenever I slip back into &quot;telling&quot; them what to do, or trying to manipulate them into something and I catch myself, I&#39;ll say something about it to them - we had a pretty good relationship[ before, but I can see more trust and joy in it, and more willingness on their part to share things with me :-)  Also there&#39;s more willingness on *my* part to see what are my issues (cleaning the house) and not feel resentful that I am washing the dishes or cleaning the bathroom *again* - actually one of the girls washed (some of) the dishes the other day, totally on her own - there&#39;s just a whole different dynamic going around!

The two reactions are very interesting. &lt;g&gt; And I&#39;m glad that things <br/>
are working out well.<br/>
<br/>
I want to point out that simply &quot;letting go&quot; of control is not what we <br/>
tend to advocate here.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than say: &quot;You can eat whatever you want&quot; and &quot;You can do <br/>
whatever you want,&quot; we generally suggest that you simply start saying <br/>
&quot;yes&quot; more. Don&#39;t pull the rug out from under them. It can be scary. <br/>
Make the transition more slowly. E-a-s-e into it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358978241">I&#39;m new to unschooling and would like to understand better how it can<br/>
work in a context where the kids have significant other role models in<br/>
their life (their mommy!) even though I am their primary caregiver. I<br/>
want to give them the best start in life, and partly from discussions<br/>
here, I realize that control and restriction brings about what your are<br/>
afraid of or worried about. I used to know this but somehow when I<br/>
landed with kids (and my every move was scrutinized) I fell back on<br/>
&quot;conventional wisdom&quot; (or &quot;how my mom did it&quot; more like) or something.<br/>
In any case, it makes sense to me that if I try to restrict or control<br/>
it&#39;s like playing tug-of-war: they pull against the restriction and it<br/>
makes them go toward what I&#39;m trying to keep them from. So no restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
My concern is that I know that I am not modeling health because I don&#39;t<br/>
feel healthy, and neither do most of the other significant role models<br/>
in their family (their grandmother and mother foremost amongst them,<br/>
according to their own words).<br/>
<br/>
But my original question wasn&#39;t exactly &quot;shouldn&#39;t I continue to control<br/>
their food because I still have some worries...&quot; it was &quot;does anyone<br/>
have any ideas how I can best deal in a situation where I am concerned<br/>
that the kids are not getting the best role models (particularly with<br/>
regard to food and TV)?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a quote from Sandra Dodd&#39;s web site:<br/>
&quot;Moving Toward Less Control, Concerning Food<br/>
Sandra Dodd, responding...<br/>
&quot;Talking about different types of foods, *modeling healthy eating<br/>
behaviors*, and helping them choose (rather than choosing for them) will<br/>
enable them to make the right choices for themselves.&quot; [my emphasis added]<br/>
<br/>
I feel confident of my understanding of the dynamic described in the<br/>
rest of the page (how humans react when restrictions are loosened and<br/>
then eventually balance out). My ongoing concern is with the modeling. I<br/>
am changing what I model, but I am not the only or maybe even the<br/>
primary influence on my half-grown (or so) step-grandkids.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else dealt with a situation where they came late to<br/>
unschooling and have eating habits they don&#39;t like the results of that<br/>
that might have affected the kids and now everything is changing?<br/>
<br/>
I see this is really two questions (1) I am concerned about my past and<br/>
perhaps ongoing modeling food behaviors I don&#39;t like the results of<br/>
(poor health); and (2) I am concerned about the modeling other<br/>
significant close family members are giving the kids (bulimia among<br/>
them). Giving the kids choice, talking to them about food and how it<br/>
feels and works for all involved should go a long way, but are there<br/>
other ideas that I&#39;ve missed?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m still seeing some control issues! You&#39;re seeing what you do as a  <br/>
way to change the kids. Focus on changing your eating habits *for  <br/>
you* and just allow your model to be there for them. Answer their  <br/>
questions, certainly. Make nutritious food available among the  <br/>
choices and easy or easier for them to grab than snacky food, yes.<br/>
<br/>
Picture the aura difference between Mother Teresa who went about her  <br/>
work with serenity knowing she was doing what was right for her and a  <br/>
fiery preacher who is out to protect people from themselves and from  <br/>
the evil in the world. Which would you be drawn to and which would  <br/>
you avoid?<br/>
<br/>
Any messages we have for our kids that they haven&#39;t asked for are  <br/>
going to be a whole lot easier for them to absorb if they&#39;re about us  <br/>
and not about the kids.<br/>
<br/>
(One caveat to anyone: don&#39;t stretch that farther than it wants to  <br/>
go. Don&#39;t avoid stopping kids from hitting each other or helping them  <br/>
find better ways to get what they want besides grabbing and so forth.)<br/>
<br/>
The more self assured you are that you&#39;re on the right path *for  <br/>
you*, the more the kids are likely to look to you as a reliable  <br/>
source of nonjudgmental, sensible information and the less they&#39;ll be  <br/>
looking to others who feel a bit rocky and less centered.<br/>
