<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001749640">Hi All --<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling (whole-life learning) is picking up momentum here in Australia.  After the success of the first ever Australian Unschooling Conference earlier this year, the second Australian Conference is to go ahead for 2011.  Check out the web site for details; pass on to all who may be interested.  <br/>

I know there are a lot of Australian unschoolers on this list!  On a more personal note, if you actively unschool, or are keen to pursue such a way of life, drop me a line!  We live in SE Melbourne.  I have three kiddies, Mia (8) Jude(5) and Rueben (2).  <br/>
<br/>
I am going to cross post, so I apologise if you read this more than once . . . <br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>
