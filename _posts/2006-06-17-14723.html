<div id="ygrps-yiv-125989343">Since the early spring my 12yo lifelong unschooled dd has been showing<br/>
an interest in going to school.  We arranged for her to visit the<br/>
middle school with her best friend in April and she came home saying<br/>
she &quot;loved&quot; it.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s still on the fence about registering for this September. She<br/>
realizes one day isn&#39;t an accurate picture of real school life.  We<br/>
talked about her needing to make a decision about going because we&#39;ll<br/>
need to get her &quot;caught up&quot; academically and vaccination-wise before<br/>
the new school year starts. (I thought once she knew she needed<br/>
vaccinations she&#39;d change her mind for sure lol!)  I suggested she<br/>
make a pros and cons list, but she rightly pointed out that she<br/>
doesn&#39;t know the pros and cons because she&#39;s never really been to<br/>
school.  <br/>
<br/>
My question is: how much input would you have?  She knows her dad and<br/>
I want her home, but we don&#39;t want to pressure her.  I&#39;m kind of<br/>
wishing that I&#39;d been more vocally anti-school while she was growing<br/>
up, but because we had so many schooled friends and relatives I&#39;ve<br/>
never really badmouthed the system.  Didn&#39;t really see a need to, but<br/>
now I&#39;m wondering if she doesn&#39;t know enough about why we unschool. <br/>
If I tell her what I think now, will she think I&#39;m just trying to<br/>
persuade her? For us, not going to school has simply been a way of<br/>
life.  There was never any &quot;huge&quot; reason why we didn&#39;t send her, but<br/>
there are a million good reasons. And how would I tell her how school<br/>
can affect her in ways she won&#39;t even realize? These abstact reasons<br/>
are probably biggest reasons we don&#39;t want her to go, yet for me,<br/>
they&#39;re some of the hardest to explain in a way a 12 yo will understand. <br/>
<br/>
As far as her reasons for wanting to go it seems it&#39;s just natural<br/>
curiosity fueling her.  I know her best friend with ulterior motives<br/>
tries to convince her that school is great, which she thankfully sees<br/>
through, but it&#39;s got her wondering.  She does have plenty of friends,<br/>
but most are schooled.  She loved the unschoolers she met at the<br/>
Peabody Conference and has kept in touch with some.  I think there&#39;s<br/>
also some level of her wanting to see &quot;how she would do&quot; grade-wise at<br/>
school. This brings up the issue of getting her &quot;caught up&quot;.  I just<br/>
printed up the mathematics curriculum framework for 6th grade, (she&#39;d<br/>
be entering 7th) and I couldn&#39;t solve the problems myself without<br/>
studying up.  I know she could catch up, but honestly don&#39;t know how<br/>
to teach this stuff.  I actually did very well in Math at school, but<br/>
of course that knowledge is long gone from my brain!   <br/>
<br/>
Also, signing her up for the school year would interfere with several<br/>
cool plans we had, one of which was a possible trip to Albuquerque in<br/>
Sept. and a trip to Disney in Nov., both of which she was/is excited<br/>
about.   Looking at the school dept. website, it looks like they have<br/>
pretty low tolerance for absenteeism.  We were planning a two week RV<br/>
trip down to FL and back avoiding the school vacation crowds.  I<br/>
suggested maybe we wait until after our trips to start school, but she<br/>
wanted to start with everyone else in Sept. if she decides to go,<br/>
which I think would probably be best anyway.   So, everything is so up<br/>
in the air and I need her to decide soon.   I know this is irrelevant,<br/>
but it would break our hearts if she decided to go.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long, but there are a lot of variables and reading<br/>
other posts I know it&#39;s best to get out as much info as possible to<br/>
get applicable advice. Thanks for taking the time!</div>

 </span></blockquote>She needs more information about the negatives of school. Could you  <br/>
have her read a bit about school - such as an essay or two from,  <br/>
&quot;Dumbing Us Down?&quot; Or the first few chapters of, &quot;The Teenage  <br/>
Liberation Handbook?&quot;<br/>
