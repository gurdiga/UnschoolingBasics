Perhaps you could purposely find other things to do during midday, like Pam  <br/>
suggested.  I don&#39;t really like sunscreen that much, seems odd to put a  bunch <br/>
of chemicals on oneself to protect us from something natural, LOL, and I  <br/>
prefer to go out later in the day so we don&#39;t need to use it.<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;ve had some great suggestions and I hope something works.<br/>
 <br/>
When I&#39;ve been in a no-win situation and it is a safety issue, I  gently draw <br/>
a line.  In my home it might go like this.  &quot;Pool time!  let&#39;s all get on our <br/>
sunscreen!&quot;  &quot;I don&#39;t want sunscreen!!&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s  not safe to be in the pool <br/>
without it.  We can play in the pool with  sunscreen or we can do <br/>
XXXXXX(something good not in the sun)&quot;.  If  they continue to be upset, I validate it and <br/>
repeat the choices.  Then  maybe, &quot;it sounds like you don&#39;t want to put on <br/>
sunscreen today, maybe we should  play princess instead, I&#39;ll get the tiaras!.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
With my kids, giving them a good alternative often freed them up from  adding <br/>
resistance on top of &quot;don&#39;t want to&quot;.  They were simply able to  choose.  And <br/>
I had to be willing to cheerfully do either.<br/>
 <br/>
I know it is not simple, especially with conflicting needs!<br/>
 <br/>
Can you sit inside and play with her and be able to watch the others?   Or <br/>
create some sort of shady tent where you two could have a tea party or  <br/>
something?<br/>
 <br/>
Leslie in SC, who is glad her children are finally past the sunscreen  issue  <br/>
