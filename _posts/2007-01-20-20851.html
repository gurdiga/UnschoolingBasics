<br/>
I am new to this also.  My kids were in public school,<br/>
until September of last year.  They do play alot of<br/>
video games, and play on the computer alot too.  I am<br/>
ok with this, because they are learning new things as<br/>
they play.  My ds is 11 and my dd is 9.  They don&#39;t<br/>
mind not doing school, because they&#39;ve had so much of<br/>
it.  We are able to have the freedom&#39;s that we&#39;ve<br/>
never had before, and we love it.  We have baked,<br/>
cooked, and traveled with my parents.  We do math when<br/>
we go to the grocery store, because I have them keep a<br/>
tab on how much we&#39;ve spent by rounding dollar amounts<br/>
up to the next even amount, and adding it all<br/>
together.  They do pretty good.  We did some gardening<br/>
this last summer/fall, and decided we weren&#39;t planting<br/>
any hostas because they were too hard to dig up.  Kids<br/>
learn all of the time, even if it doesn&#39;t look like<br/>
they are doing anything.  I love the unschooling life,<br/>
we learn every day by life&#39;s little lessons, and if<br/>
they ask questions, we find out the answers together.<br/>
<br/>
If you try it, and don&#39;t like it, you can always try a<br/>
different way.  My kids love it, because they had so<br/>
many things to do at school (my son had no less than 4<br/>
or 5 book reports to do at public school, and hated<br/>
doing them, and my daughter had her own set of issues<br/>
too.)  Unschooling affords them to learn about the<br/>
things they find interesting.  That&#39;s what is<br/>
important--getting their love of learning back, by<br/>
letting them pick and choose what they want to learn<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, let go, and have some fun.  Take time to<br/>
enjoy your kids.  I am still trying to reconnect with<br/>
my kids, and learn what&#39;s important to them.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Many people don&#39;t read for fun, or do any math they can avoid (even <br/>
balancing checkbooks), never write stories and spend most of the day <br/>
on the computer. I can think of half a dozen &quot;successful&quot; people I <br/>
know personally who fit that description (okay, One of them writes <br/>
stories! but that&#39;s not his main job). <br/>
<br/>
Take some time on your own to think of all the things you did/do for <br/>
pleasure and what kinds of things you learned from them. Look at the <br/>
adults around you who are happy - where and how did they learn &quot;what <br/>
they needed&quot; to be who and where they are today? <br/>
<br/>
What kinds of computer games do your kids enjoy? Do you play them <br/>
too? That can be a big mental hurdle for a Lot of adults - kind of <br/>
like Rock and Roll was a big mental hurdle a couple generations <br/>
ago ;) Try out some different games - really try, too, don&#39;t just <br/>
play for fifteen minutes and throw down the controller in <br/>
frustration. There&#39;s a learning curve in figuring out the controls, <br/>
especially if you&#39;re brand new. Play enough to get a sense of what <br/>
the goals are in the game and which parts are exciting to your kids. <br/>
Ask them for help and advice (let *them* teach *you* something, <br/>
maybe!). Decide if you find the same parts fun or frustrating - <br/>
there&#39;s some valuble information, right there, about interests and <br/>
learning styles. Talk with your kids about the games from the <br/>
perspective of someone who plays them - its a *different* <br/>
perspective, and one that will bring you closer to your kids.<br/>

hates anything that reminds him of school, so asking him to &quot;do <br/>

learning to cook, though, and he&#39;s a big eater, so he&#39;s forever <br/>

The other day we were talking about our budget (and current lack <br/>
thereof) and what kind of game system we&#39;d like to get when we have <br/>
the cash. He knows an amazing amount about which systems tend to <br/>
have more of which types of games, how much they cost new and used, <br/>
which stores have better deals - I was impressed. He&#39;s great at that <br/>
kind of comparitive analysis. Once again, not something I had to <br/>
tell him to do - he&#39;s interested in the subject (both subjects! he <br/>
*wants* to know about the family finances) so he learns about it. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right, you are still stuck in that school mindset, &lt;grin&gt; I see<br/>
two problems that are keeping you hemmed in that frame of mind.<br/>
<br/>
First, you mention that if left to their own devices they wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;do&quot; math. You have to stop thinking about math in terms of<br/>
worksheets, textbooks, pages of drill problems and memorizing the<br/>
times table, etc. You&#39;re thinking of learning as this separate process<br/>
that occurs outside the realm of real life only when workbooks and<br/>
school assignments are present. That&#39;s really limiting. They will &quot;do&quot;<br/>
math as it applies to their life. If they have an allowance and they<br/>
want to buy something from the store then they&#39;ll have to figure out<br/>
how much they need to save and so forth. If they want to make a cake<br/>
they&#39;ll need to understand measurements like weight, volume, and<br/>
temperature. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll learn to tell time just by going about<br/>
their lives (or perhaps they already know).<br/>
<br/>
Certain math skills are required in common living experiences, others<br/>
aren&#39;t. And if they aren&#39;t necessary for everyday living, then there<br/>
isn&#39;t a reason to know them right now because that information would<br/>
serve no purpose; it has no forseeable application. You&#39;re right -<br/>
your kids probably will avoid doing workbook stuff, and if that&#39;s the<br/>
only way you think of learning, then you&#39;re definitely selling things<br/>
short! It&#39;s certainly not the only way to learn math or any other<br/>
skill.<br/>
<br/>
Second - and this may be the hardest thing you&#39;ll ever do - you need<br/>
to stop thinking that you ever taught them anything. You didn&#39;t. You<br/>
might have helped them further their own understanding, but the truth<br/>
is that the only way anyone ever learns is when we&#39;re ready,<br/>
interested, and have received the information in a meaningful way.<br/>
*They* learned it, you helped them by providing information or<br/>
experiences. But you didn&#39;t open up their heads and insert the<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
Did you &quot;teach&quot; your kids to walk? To eat? No. You might have held<br/>
their hands and surrounded them with opportunity, encouragement and<br/>
examples, but you didn&#39;t teach it. Just as surely you didn&#39;t teach<br/>
them their ABCs or how to read. It&#39;s funny how society looks at<br/>
learning as if it&#39;s something done to a child, like a process applied<br/>
to a kid by the teacher. But it&#39;s not. It&#39;s internal and natural and<br/>
automatic when the right elements are in place. I read somewhere that<br/>
it&#39;s helpful to replace the word &quot;teach&quot; with the word &quot;learn&quot;. You<br/>
could even put a dollar in a jar everything you think or say, &quot;I<br/>
teach&quot; or &quot;they were taught&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you could get past those two (admittedly big) hurdles then<br/>
you&#39;d be able to relax a bit and feel comfortable giving unschooling a<br/>
real go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140486949">I don&#39;t ask my kids to do math.  They are simply<br/>
helping me to remember how much money we are spending,<br/>
because we are on such a limited budget.  I don&#39;t<br/>
always remember where we are at with the money, so<br/>
they help me.  Every child is different.  Not all of<br/>
them like doing the same things.  Mine don&#39;t mind<br/>
doing this, because they are helping mommy.<br/>
<br/>
They also have different intersts.  My son loves video<br/>
games, and plays them all the time.  He keeps trying<br/>
to figure out different ways to afford new games, and<br/>
is quickly learning that selling them to Game Stop is<br/>
not such a good idea- that he won&#39;t get what<br/>
he&#39;s/we&#39;ve paid for them.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter spent some time yesterday, playing with<br/>
some cardboard, and blocks of styrofoam, building a<br/>
castle she named after her.  She also did puzzles, and<br/>
played with her dolls, and played video games with my<br/>
son.<br/>
<br/>
They have now been out of school for four-five months<br/>
and are loving it.  They still learn, and are not<br/>
asked to do math on a daily basis.  Helping me track<br/>
of how much we spend, is just that &quot;helping me&quot;, and<br/>
nothing more.  When I have two kids with me talking to<br/>
me at the same time, I tend to forget where we are<br/>
with money.  This just helps me remember.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-510134558"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s been a while since I posted, but thought I would throw in my two <br/>
cents worth. I&#39;ve been reading all your posts on children eating <br/>
sweets, and I just think, my story needs to be told. I am a overweight <br/>
mom of a 11 year old overweight daughter, and to be honest with you, I <br/>
really don&#39;t know who is right or wrong about how a child grows up, one <br/>
having no sweets in the house verses one having anything they wanted. I <br/>
feel that I eat out of stress, due to money issues, being single again, <br/>
and my disabilities. I also believe my daughter eats for the same <br/>
reasons. Living off the state for any disabilities doesn&#39;t bring enough <br/>
money in for anything, let alone the bills. I&#39;ve really needed to be <br/>
watching my daughters and my eating habits, however the more stress, <br/>
the more you eat. Right before my disabilities we use to walk 3 miles a <br/>
day without a problem, since then, and two years ago, we have had to <br/>
live another life. We are lucky if we can get to the YWCA a few times a <br/>
week to do water workouts. Since this all has happened in our life, I <br/>
have put on 50 pounds, my daughter has put on 50-60 pounds. She is now <br/>
at danger of going on pills for Diabetes this week. She just can&#39;t seem <br/>
to shake off the weight, myself included. I have tried everything I <br/>
could to keep healthy stuff around the house, it doesn&#39;t work, we end <br/>
up going out and getting something sweet at the end of almost each day. <br/>
I allow one or maybe two sweets a day, but it just seems as if we <br/>
aren&#39;t loosing the weight. I come from a family where my mother was a <br/>
junk food junkie, but in secret, she hid all the stuff. As kids we <br/>
weren&#39;t allowed to have much. When my daughter was born, she was a very <br/>
picky eater, and wouldn&#39;t eat much at all. Infact I had to feed her 7 <br/>
or 8 times a day just to make sure she got enough food intake. I think <br/>
she has learned the eating pattern from watching me, even though I <br/>
never really offered her a lot of sweets, it seems like I just can&#39;t <br/>
stop her either. I would like to change things and let her eat all she <br/>
wants, but at this point I&#39;m to scared. She has type 2 diabetes that <br/>
can be controlled with what she eats, and  Doctors say 2 hrs of <br/>
exercise a day. &quot;A bit too unrealistic in my book&quot;. Any pointers, I <br/>
would love to hear them. I seem to be stuck... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-557832">I have been thinking alot about what you just emailed.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am still new at this, and haven&#39;t been &quot;teaching&quot; my<br/>
kids anything.  My kids were in school up until<br/>
September of last year, so we are still deschooling. <br/>
We just go with the flow of things, and when they are<br/>
interested in something we learn about it together. <br/>
There is no forced learning at our house.  That was<br/>
what they did in public school.<br/>
<br/>
When I was talking about having them help me keep<br/>
track of what we spend, it was not a math lesson.  My<br/>
kids are less than two years a part in age, and tend<br/>
to both talk to me at the same time.  When I am trying<br/>
to keep track of what we spend, (not because I want<br/>
to, but because money is extremely tight.) and they<br/>
are talking to me at the same time, I lose my train of<br/>
thought and have to start all over again.  So when<br/>
they help me, it is not because I am trying to sneak<br/>
in some kind of math lesson, it is because they like<br/>
to help, and we add all the number together.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
just them, it&#39;s me too.  I don&#39;t make them help me,<br/>
they do it because they like to.<br/>
<br/>
I am still new at this, and am bound to make mistakes.<br/>
 I am, by no means a perfect parent.  I am not angry. <br/>
I just don&#39;t understand when I&#39;m trying to show how<br/>
things are used in every day life, I keep being told<br/>
that I am doing things wrong.  If I call adding<br/>
numbers together math, it&#39;s because that&#39;s how I&#39;ve<br/>
always thought of it, not because it&#39;s a schooly term,<br/>
what else would you call it?<br/>
<br/>
My wording was probably a little off when I said I<br/>
have them help, but I don&#39;t make them help.  I don&#39;t<br/>
mind some constructive comments, but sometimes it<br/>
seems like I come under fire alot.  I guess part of me<br/>
needed to talk about this, just to get it off my<br/>
chest.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>

Ren&#39;s reply wasn&#39;t meant to attack you. She was simply questioning your motive. ANd <br/>
again---not to attack, but to help *you* (and others) see how we say things can color how<br/>
we are perceived.<br/>
<br/>
I do exactly what you do. Duncan and I keep a running tally of about how much we&#39;re <br/>
spending---rounded up or down a bit depending on the last item. $1.19 beans, $3 <br/>
onions, $2.37 chicken stock, $3.99 sausage would end up being almost $10. Do I make <br/>
him? No---he could go off and do other things or not even accompany me to the store. <br/>
But when we go together, it&#39;s a game we play and have since before he was born (with his <br/>
brother).<br/>
<br/>
When we can change our language, we can change our thoughts and make that paradigm <br/>
shift. But it&#39;s not easy!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not being told &quot;you&#39;re doing it wrong.&quot;  You&#39;re actually doing it *right*! &lt;g&gt;---but <br/>
folks here *will* question your motives.  Just SO you&#39;ll explain further (or think about it at <br/>
home and not post sometimes) as you focus onthe what, how, and why.<br/>
<br/>
Your explanation above made more unschooly sense than your original post. It explains <br/>
what and how and why. You&#39;re doing fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064956562">Yes, you are right, and I have tried many things, one being working out in the Y&#39;s pool when we can get there. Other wise, I bought an  exercise bike &quot;which takes me pulling her arm to get motivated to even get her on it&quot;.  We have started walking again, if we can do even a few blocks a day or every other day, but the weather has not been our friend, with the snow and ice. We take a few Tripp&#39;s a week to Super Wal-mart where we walk, or I ride on the electric cart while she walks around and around! But I just feel like it&#39;s not helping  her to lose the weight. I&quot;ve tried putting this Doctor appointment off three times now, in fear of what this medications side effects will have on her. I was told the side effects are rough.. I&#39;m still not sure I&#39;m going to go along with it, but I&#39;m still in fear of her health. She is a beautiful young girl, but has the body of a 18 yr old, and men do look.. that really gets me upset. But she is a big girl, and that won&#39;t change, her weight<br/>
 will over the years, and your right that doesn&#39;t mean she is not healthy. I feel if we can exercise as much as we can, and still eat the foods we like we will be one step ahead.. Thanks for your input..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295869633">Hi Meredith,<br/>
  Thanks for your response, I am in the process now of looking for the help my daughter needs. However I am very skeptical of getting help from the state, &quot;which is the only way I can afford it&quot; because they look into your personal life. I don&#39;t want anyone getting involved with our business, I know they won&#39;t agree with unschooling, and I don&#39;t want to go thru any more battles, which might be very departmental for my daughter at this point. I think I&#39;ll start looking on line to see what I can find out, haven&#39;t thought about the book store, duh!  As far as grieving goes, I know she has been grieving, but is afraid to let it all out, even though we are close, she doesn&#39;t want to hurt me in any way. So her release is eating, as is mine.. I know we need to start getting out and joining some groups. I&#39;ve been looking for just that, but  haven&#39;t been successful as of yet. The groups I have found are for adults only &quot;go figure&quot;.  But I&#39;m not giving up here. Thanks for your ideas,<br/>
 I will look into them... Debra<br/>
