<div id="ygrps-yiv-709967731">Hi,<br/>
   Thank you to all that shared. I do think pin pointing what I need<br/>
when I am grumpy is a good idea but my husband works alot at night so<br/>
I will have to work around that. I have tried bringing the three year<br/>
old upstairs into my bed and watching tv. She is a chatter box though<br/>
and ends up waking me which in turn makes me more cranky. Any ideas<br/>
for this?<br/>
   We do have a bedtime ritual and she generally is in bed by 9:00 but<br/>
sometimes earlier if she hasn&#39;t napped for a few days in a row. My<br/>
other two are fine for the most part at night. During the day my<br/>
crankiness comes out when they are fighting with each other and I am<br/>
tired.<br/>
    Thanks for sharing all your bedtime stories!!<br/>
Danette</div>
