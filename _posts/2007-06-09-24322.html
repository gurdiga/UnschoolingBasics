<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684023092">I&#39;ve had some interesting conversations with some awesome teenagers lately,  <br/>
and wanted to share some ideas that have come up.<br/>
 <br/>
We had a passel of teenagers visiting at different times in the last weeks,  <br/>
and I am also honored that some of my teenaged son&#39;s friends often <br/>
spontaneously  begin IM conversations with me. These kids are all either unschooled or  <br/>
attended/currently attend a Sudbury school.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I joked with one of my son&#39;s male friends that some of us unschooling moms  <br/>
talk about fixing up their kids. I laughed that it was probably that we would  <br/>
prefer they not marry &quot;outside the religion.&quot; He laughed, but said he was  <br/>
certain that it would be a priority when he has kids that they unschool. I asked  <br/>
him -- what would you think if it was important to your partner that she (he <br/>
is  straight) work outside the home? He said he&#39;d be happy to stay home and do <br/>
music  and be with his kids. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that male and female, these kids seem to consider  <br/>
more than their schooled peers what kind of relationships they want when they  <br/>
are adults. Maybe it&#39;s because unschooling is all about relationship. As <br/>
Julian  plans his future, he doesn&#39;t just think about the work he will do -- he <br/>
also  thinks about family life. I think particularly for boys, this is unusual. <br/>
It&#39;s  pretty cool.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed the same thing ...it&#39;s really cool.<br/>
Trevor is dating another unschooled kid. I&#39;ve had time to reflect on<br/>
all that pressure my family put on my to date within our church and<br/>
how very different the situations are.<br/>
<br/>
I felt this tremendous pressure and guilt over liking boys that<br/>
weren&#39;t in our church. It was awful. Yet here is my child dating<br/>
another unschooler and while we certainly don&#39;t think of unschooling<br/>
as any kind of religion, it&#39;s important to him that any long term<br/>
partnership involves agreement on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
He has put a lot of thought into it. Both of them have put thought and<br/>
conversation into the sex issue. I think they&#39;re so far ahead of<br/>
myself at that age. There&#39;s a level of awareness about big issues that<br/>
I tried to avoid. No guilt, no pressure has equaled some very<br/>
thoughtful and mature individuals that care deeply about healthy<br/>
relationships.<br/>

Not too long ago, DS opined that if he married someone who had a job<br/>
that paid enough money to live on, he could stay home and unschool the<br/>
kids. (Given that DH is the at home parent and has been for all of DS&#39;<br/>
memory (since he was not quite 2), it&#39;s not too hard to understand where<br/>
that idea came from lol)<br/>
