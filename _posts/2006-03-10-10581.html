<div id="ygrps-yiv-933105960">Wearing a seat belt is the law. Ever since my daughter was old enough to understand, the car did not start until the seat belt was buckled. She never questioned that, it was simply a fact of life. Now she asks me not to start the car, if someone has forgotten to &quot;buckle up&quot;. I would not drive my car with someone in it not buckled, both because it is breaking the law (with fines involved) and because I feel that it is worth it to wear a seat belt (does prevent many injuries). I choose not to start the engine until everyone is using their seat belts, if you don&#39;t want to wear a seat belt, then you can choose not to ride with me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-119624461">As I have said, while I don&#39;t have the words to make it sound unschooly...<br/>
my son doesn&#39;t even know or think of it as a rule. It is something we all do<br/>
to be safe. I did tell her that she needed to buckle her belt before we<br/>
left. Because my car usually carries more then my kids, I have booster seats<br/>
and cool things that go on the buckles so that they don&#39;t choke the kids or<br/>
chaff.<br/>
<br/>
Usually, the most I ever have to ask a child is, &quot;Can you buckle your belt<br/>
or do you need me to do it?&quot; When S said she didn&#39;t want to do it, I didn&#39;t<br/>
even get a chance to say anything more because my son jumped up and buckled<br/>
her in. She didn&#39;t object or shoo him away - she let him do it. <br/>
