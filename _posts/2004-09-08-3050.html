<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I met so many beautiful unschoolers at the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>conference and I really noticed the differences from other couples <br/>
that I&#39;ve come in contact with over the years. Gentle unschooling <br/>
parents carry it over in their adult relationships. The ones that <br/>
REALLY &quot;get it&quot; when it comes to gentle parenting, are also gentle <br/>
partners. Not all of the time, but most.&lt; <br/>
<br/>
Sandra just said something along these same lines in talking about how she <br/>
became more gentle with her dh, knowing that most men have a hurt little boy <br/>
inside who was not parented gently.  I saved her post and know I&#39;m not quoting <br/>
her exactly but....She mentioned she just started being motherly/nurturing <br/>
towards him and how that kindness & love, and that, in turn, helped him to become a <br/>
&#39;softer&#39; person.  <br/>
<br/>
I have to say that both of these posts really struck me (like, DUH!) as I&#39;ve <br/>
been focusing all my &#39;unschooling&#39; energy towards my dd, but not necessarily <br/>
to my dh...  Our relationship had stayed the same, with me not carrying my <br/>
shift of thinking over to where it was affecting him (Hmm...no wonder he&#39;s having <br/>
a hard time understanding unschooling!) :(  <br/>
<br/>
I feel sad that I didn&#39;t get this before, it seems so obvious. But there it <br/>
is.  Today&#39;s a new day...he won&#39;t know what the heck is going on - LOL!  But <br/>
I&#39;m positive he&#39;ll like it, and probably be able to finally *see what I&#39;ve been <br/>
talking about :)  LOL - Just when I think I&#39;m really getting unschooling, my <br/>
eyes are opened to yet another instant where I see that I have a long way to go!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
