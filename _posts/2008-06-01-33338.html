<div id="ygrps-yiv-665846784">Hey<br/>
<br/>
Our family attended the Peabody conference last weekend and we have <br/>
not been the same since - we have metamorphasised!  My three boys 8,5 <br/>
and 4 had no idea about what was going on for it was just business as <br/>
usual for them, lots of running around, new friends to meet, and more <br/>
running around - it was a privaledge to watch them BE!  <br/>
<br/>
As I found out on the ride home, through some of the most beautiful <br/>
New England towns, that my wife Rosie suggested our attendance as a <br/>
way for me to get a first hand helping of RU.  She had sent me <br/>
Dayna&#39;s YouTube postings and other links. I watched and read and felt <br/>
a little ting.  I have to be honsest that it was not until we arrived <br/>
at the conference on Friday when we went into the playroom that I <br/>
really began to GET IT - here were my three boys, lots of toys other <br/>
kids and adults and everyone was having a blast - I did not here the <br/>
word NO which made me feel pretty good.  <br/>
<br/>
The whole weekend was fantabulous - I met so many people who gave me <br/>
a lot of inspiration and confidence that RU is the way to go.  I have <br/>
always felt that something is wrong with the education system in the <br/>
world, for I have been working as a teacher, dyslexia specialist and <br/>
consultant in the US and UK. That is a completely different post and <br/>
when I have time I will be sure to share my experience with the <br/>
horrors I have seen in both systems.  I am lucky to have gotten out - <br/>
let the healing begin!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Any how, this past week has been the most precious week ever and it <br/>
has felt like it has gone so slow so I have been able to really take <br/>
in the shift which has occured.  Rosie and I have been listening to <br/>
the CD&#39;s we won in the raffle and pass each other with a grin on our <br/>
faces which says &quot;Did you listen to so and so and wasn&#39;t it <br/>
amazing!&quot;  Rosie and I are grateful for our life and having the <br/>
oportunity to share each moment of every day with each other and our <br/>
boys makes it even sweeter. Like I said this past week has been so <br/>
amazing in that we began to see a rythm emerge which has made each <br/>
day so relaxed - whilst there are still burning questions about how <br/>
to do this and should we let the boys do that or how can we figure <br/>
this out and so on...- life has this past week has been REAL!  The <br/>
house is in a bit of chaos, laundry is backed up, and after our movie <br/>
marathon yesterday, there is still a coating of popcorn on the <br/>
sitting room floor - isn&#39;t life grand!<br/>
<br/>
I am hooked on the RU way and have really let the Peabody experience <br/>
sink in this week.  I am excited for the present day as I know the <br/>
furture is bright and full of opportunity and the past is the past.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
<br/>
