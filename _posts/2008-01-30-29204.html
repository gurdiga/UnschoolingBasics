I generally don&#39;t tie it down to one person but when I hit a wall about<br/>
something I mentally write a post and try to explain to y&#39;all in general<br/>
what&#39;s going on. Trying to verbalize it then clarify it usually helps me<br/>

<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
<br/>
There are days when the lists just start getting to me. I usually take <br/>
a break then. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ben asks why I don&#39;t just stop. Close the list. Give it to someone <br/>
else. Just stop.<br/>
<br/>
But *I* get so much out of the writing. I get to make sense out of it <br/>
in my own head. I get to work through how *I* could handle it better. <br/>
By reading AND writing.<br/>
<br/>
If I can wrestle it down and pin-point how *I* can hog-tie it, then <br/>
maybe I&#39;ll do better myself next time. It solidifies my own thoughts <br/>
and beliefs. It helps me trust myself and my kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really handy! &lt;G&gt; Y&#39;all help *ME* so much too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063642653">&quot;are there any unschooler single parents out there? i can&#39;t imagine <br/>
having my kids up until whenever they want to go to bed on their <br/>
own. mainly because i&#39;m a single parent, live in a tiny 950sq foot 1 <br/>
floor apt with 4 kids, i&#39;m a light sleeper, there is so much else to <br/>
get done around the house and oh yay.....need some quiet time if <br/>
there is any time left in the day left after all that.<br/>
seriously... ?<br/>
i read these posts and can&#39;t figure out how you all do it. you make <br/>
it sound so peaceful and i&#39;m frazzled juggling all the demands on me.<br/>
i live two hours from my family (who don&#39;t line up to take the kids <br/>
for the weekend anyway), have no contact with birth father and am <br/>
totally on my own out here.&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m not a single parent now but I was one for about 9 years, with only one child, though. I also just spent a little over a year with my dp deployed. I have 3 kids now, one of which I had about halfway through my dp&#39;s deployment. So, I had to be a single parent temporarily. <br/>
   <br/>
  My teenager had pretty much free reign. As long as he didn&#39;t disturb me while I was sleeping he could stay up as late as he wanted. My other 2 are younger, just turned 4 years and 7 months. We do have a bedtime with them but it&#39;s based on when everyone gets sleepy. Also, it&#39;s not written in stone. If someone falls asleep earlier, that&#39;s fine. Or, if our normal bedtime comes and someone&#39;s not sleepy, they are not forced to go to bed. I needed the bedtime just as much as the LOs because by the end of the day I was so tired that I had nothing left.<br/>
   <br/>
  The only suggestion I have is to hire a mother&#39;s helper if you can. They are much cheaper than a housekeeper but can really take the load off of the daily chore grind. Even if you have someone come just a couple times a week, it can really help. They can also watch your kids if you&#39;d like, so you can run a quick errand or just get a much needed 15 minute bath. My dp just got home yesterday. Last night I snuck off and took a really hot bath. It been since before he left (over a year) since I had been able to take a bath by myself.<br/>
