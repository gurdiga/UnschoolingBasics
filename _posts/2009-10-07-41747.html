<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537932691">I&#39;ve never posted here before but I have been lurking for a very long time.<br/>
A little intro first --- I have one dd who is 7 and she&#39;s never been to school. I started out in Kinder with doing the whole school-at-home thing and it just didn&#39;t work. I came across unschooling and poured myself into books and forums, ect. We&#39;ve been unschooling ever since and every day I feel more and more comfortable with our decision. She&#39;s so bright and so smart and is just wonderful to be around, but that&#39;s besides the point... LOL<br/>
<br/>
I know absolutely nobody else who unschools. Everyone in our homeschool group uses curriculum and mimics school at home and that is what most conversations revolve around. It frustrates me when I hear the other mothers talk about how much of a hard time they are having with their 1st grader or 3rd grader when it comes to &quot;school&quot;. I just want to tell them to back off and leave their poor kids alone, but of course I bite my tongue and say nothing. <br/>
I am starting to feel very very alone. I hate that I have no one else around who is as passionate about unschooling as I am. My dh is wonderful support but I guess it&#39;s not the same as having a friend with other kids who do the same thing as we do.<br/>
Anyone else in the same boat? How do you deal with feeling so alone?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461963797">I have been there, especially after attending an Unschooling Conference. But now I feel I have friends everywhere!!!!!!!! I keep in touch on Facebook, I go to Sandra Dodd chats when I can.<br/>
I own an unschooling group in my State and we even had a state wide get together this past February for two days at a water park. THere were a total of 61 people that came!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
Its wonderful to know that even thou there is only one local family that radical unschools in my town but there are others around not too far. <br/>
Keep in my some of my favorite people are from 3.5 hours away to a whole ocean!!!!!!!!<br/>
Join Facebook and Look up Alexandra Polikowsky. Send em a note and a friend request. I will hook you up with unschoolers.<br/>
Another thing that helped me was accept that most of the  local homeschoolers I know are NOT radical unschoolers. THat way I accept them for who they are instead of wishing they were someone else.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes its easier to hang out with childless adults than other families, or families with teens instead of little kids. My kids both enjoy older company, so hanging around school kids often doesn&#39;t work out for them anyway. <br/>
<br/>
My unschooling friends are all online. Are you on facebook? Its really nice to be able to see some daily messages about people being happy with their kids. Its cheering. And its a good way to find out who&#39;s artsy and who&#39;s silly and who&#39;s a great cook... things you don&#39;t really learn from these terribly serious posts on the discussion lists! <br/>
<br/>
I try to get out to one or two unschooling gatherings every year. This year I feel like I&#39;ve had &quot;extra&quot; bc we were able to stop over at unschoolers&#39; homes on the way to and from visiting family, as well. Its nice to get to see unschoolers in their &quot;natural habitats&quot; too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-96263496">I, too, am feeling isolated.  We live in a rural, conservative Christian area in California&#39;s Central Valley.  I have many school-at-home acquaintances, but only one other family who unschools.  I am so blessed to have her, but would love a larger community.<br/>
 I &#39;friended&#39; Alexandra Polikowsky...online support seems the way to go.  We are out there.  Anyone else near Merced?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-188363701">We live in the very southern part of Texas down by South Padre Island/Brownsville. I&#39;ve created a Yahoo group (in hopes that someone like me is searching!) as well as posted on our city forum. When you search for unschooling and our city my post is one of the first things that come up on Google. Not sure what else to do besides that. <br/>
The closest unschooling group that I have been able to find is in San Antonio, TX, which is about 4 hours north from us. I joined the Yahoo group for them because we do go to San Antonio quite a bit so I thought it&#39;d be great to meet up with them at some point but our trips have not worked out the same time as their get-togethers.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that we have NOT done is to go to an unschooling conference - which I am sooo wanting to do!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you for your support and posts! <br/>

a great group.  I hope you can make it to a park day soon.  The park might<br/>
