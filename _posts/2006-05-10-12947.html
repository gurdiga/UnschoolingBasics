<div id="ygrps-yiv-34554992">I read an article about an engineering college<br/>
(Olin)that&#39;s turning engineering upside down.<br/>
Traditionally all engg students are required to do a<br/>
number of math and science courses and then later<br/>
they&#39;re supposed to apply that knowledge. This college<br/>
is starting with projects and then throwing in some<br/>
theory. It makes a lot of sense because the students<br/>
then have a real interest and need to learn the<br/>
theory. <br/>
<br/>
Here are some interesting quotes from the article:<br/>
--<br/>
<br/>
Miller (the president) explains the philosophy behind<br/>
what he calls the &quot;do and then learn&quot; approach.<br/>
&quot;Students start out with an audacious project, which<br/>
would in many institutions be heretical, except we do<br/>
that deliberately,&quot; the amiable 56-year-old executive<br/>
says. &quot;Because, after all, when you get hired in a<br/>
corporation, that&#39;s the first thing that happens to<br/>
you: they give you a challenge for which you&#39;ve not<br/>
had the prerequisites. It&#39;s all about learning how to<br/>
learn. So we do that here from day one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
They (i.e the faculty) wanted to determine whether<br/>
students have to sit through a barrage of fundamental<br/>
courses before designing and building anything at all.<br/>
They divided the students into small groups and<br/>
assigned them a task: they had eight weeks to design,<br/>
build, and demonstrate a pulse oximeter, a medical<br/>
instrument clipped onto a patient&#39;s finger to<br/>
electronically measure pulse rate and blood oxygen<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
The professors showed the groups a commercial unit and<br/>
referred them to relevant patents and other technical<br/>
documentation in a step-by-step guided design. The<br/>
faculty&#39;s plan was to watch carefully as the groups<br/>
progressed and discover where and why they failed.<br/>
&quot;The problem is, they didn&#39;t fail,&quot; Miller says. &quot;They<br/>
got it to work. This wasn&#39;t the highest-quality<br/>
fabrication in the world; it was a very crude-looking<br/>
circuit board with a lot of transistors. But it<br/>
worked. And we said, &#39;Aha! There&#39;s something to this.<br/>
You don&#39;t need to have prerequisites.&#39; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even more revealing, he adds, was the effect the<br/>
exercise had on the students. &quot;They now wanted to know<br/>
what a transistor isÂ—badly. They now had a sincere,<br/>
deep, personal motivation to learn electromagnetic<br/>
theory and circuit design. These kids will never<br/>
forget the experience they had in that project.&quot;<br/>
