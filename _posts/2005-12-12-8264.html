===== Ren:<br/>
Joyce posted this over at the &quot;No More Spanking&quot; list earlier today<br/>
and I thought it was really great...especially in light of all our<br/>
discussion on corporal punishment:<br/>
<br/>
===== back to me:<br/>
I glanced at the most recent newsletter from the Natural Child Project<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/naturalchildproject/)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/naturalchildproject/)</a><br/>
and right there was &quot;Children want their own way... like everyone  <br/>
else!&quot; and I clicked on the link and it went to these really neat  <br/>
cards. On the page you can click on the picture and get some random  <br/>
ones to see what they&#39;re like:<br/>
<br/>
Your child has years and years to become an adult.<br/>
A child at play is a young scientist, learning about the world.<br/>
Treausre this time ... children grow up fast!<br/>
&quot;There is no reason why we cannot say &#39;No&#39; to children in just as  <br/>
kind a way as we say &#39;Yes&#39;.&quot; John Holt<br/>
Listen openly to your child&#39;s ideas.<br/>
Your child may have the solution.<br/>
Alternatives to punishment: listening, understanding, compassion,  <br/>
validation, gentle instruction, and humor.<br/>
Gentle guidance is best.<br/>
No child was ever spoiled by too much love.<br/>
Let your child be a child.<br/>
Try whispering if your words aren&#39;t heard.<br/>
Believe in your child&#39;s good intentions.<br/>
Children reflect the treatment they receive.<br/>
Look past the behavior ... What is your child feeling?<br/>
<br/>
There are 100 of them for $15. Really cool.<br/>
<br/>
