<div id="ygrps-yiv-569413384">This topic brings up a lot of interesting thoughts for me. <br/>
 <br/>
Right now I have been married for a couple of years to my partner of more  <br/>
than 16 years, thanks to those lovely Massachusetts Activist Judges.  So  I&#39;m a <br/>
big fan of marriage for a lot of reasons, including health insurance. But  I&#39;m <br/>
not more committed to Beth than I was before we could get married legally.  <br/>
(I say legally because we&#39;d gotten married two times before -- first, in a holy <br/>
 union in our church, then a civil union in Vermont.) <br/>
 <br/>
That said, I don&#39;t think we&#39;d consider moving to a place where we wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
be married, which lets out the rest of the US.  <br/>
 <br/>
The other thing about young marriage. Julian is in a relationship with  <br/>
another unschooler, who he met at conferences and lives in Arkansas. She&#39;s a few  <br/>
years younger than him and she&#39;s very far away. But I could see them ending up  <br/>
together permanently. They come from families with similar values and ideas  <br/>
about parenting. They have similar temperaments -- both are calm, sweet, <br/>
gentle  people. They are incredibly kind to each other.<br/>
 <br/>
I would hope that they wait a long time before making a permanent  <br/>
committment, because I think they both should have a chance to be kids as long  as they <br/>
can and want to.  But I really respect their relationship.<br/>

<br/>
See, and that&#39;s one of MY arguments against marriage!:)<br/>
I don&#39;t think the government has any business deciding what<br/>
constitutes a &quot;couple&quot; and I think insurance should be offered for<br/>
anyone in the same household/companionship type of arrangement. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to work for a company that offers insurance for any and all<br/>
employees, regardless of whether they are legally married, same sex or<br/>
any other situation.  I really detest that anyone else can decide what<br/>
constitutes a binding relationship based on sex or some certificate. argh.<br/>
<br/>
But, laws being what they are currently, anyone that wants to be<br/>
legally married should be able to do so.<br/>

stepson. We can&#39;t register with the local authorities b/c George <br/>
doesn&#39;t have the educational requirements and I&#39;m not his wife. <br/>
Fortunately for us, the Farm (that ol&#39; hippie place) has just become <br/>
legit as a means of registering for homeschool and they (with some <br/>
prodding on my part) have agreed that marriage doesn&#39;t make a <br/>
family/ partnership (or gender, or number of &quot;parents&quot;). They&#39;ve <br/>
also agreed not to have educational requirements for parents, but <br/>
that&#39;s a different topic.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m curious. So your state needs the parents to meet<br/>
some educational requirements to be able to homeschool<br/>
a child? I live in one of the stricter states (MA) and<br/>
I haven&#39;t heard of that requirement here.<br/>
<br/>
I think in your case though you probably wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
able to register even if you were married. The state<br/>
would probably require a parent to do it and<br/>
step-parent may not qualify. <br/>
<br/>
I have long wanted a notion of a &quot;household&quot; where a<br/>
group of people living together can register<br/>
themselves as a household and be treated as a family<br/>
without the govt poking its head into who&#39;s having sex<br/>
with whom.<br/>
