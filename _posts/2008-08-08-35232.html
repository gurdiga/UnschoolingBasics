<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119061827">unschoolingbasics&quot;I would feel awful if I dismissed something that my children liked with the comment that my lack of interest hadn&#39;t stopped the world from spinning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, quite the opposite. I think it frees them to decide what they like for themselves. With or without my enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
Now, there are many TVs and several computers in this house. Nobody HAS to watch what the other wants to watch. <br/>
<br/>
And my children are older -- 13 and 15 -- and aren&#39;t hanging on my every word. <br/>
<br/>
We went through the things where I pretended to be interested when they were very young. We watched or read things that really, in truth, did not interest me -- Dr. Seuss is neat but . .  :)<br/>
<br/>
But then we reached the age of Pokemon cards and there was some other trading card game. I didn&#39;t care about them, DS was into them. I drove, I bought, he collected and traded. And talked at me about them but didn&#39;t expect me to remember all the details he did. He actually enjoyed knowing things I did not know. It was HIS thing. <br/>
<br/>
And things grew from there, I think. I think that was the turning point. Where he started to have independent activities -- independent from me. <br/>
<br/>
And watching TV around here has always been an interactive activity anyway. We have always sliced and diced ads, for instance. <br/>
<br/>
To the point where DD will remind the rest of us &quot;it&#39;s just an ad&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s just a show&quot; -- it doesn&#39;t actually have to hold together in a perfectly logical way. We get carried away sometimes. :)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know -- we just aren&#39;t required to assign value to things because the other person likes it. If I don&#39;t like football, I feel free to watch something else and not hide my disdain from DH. After all, he&#39;s a Jets fan. He&#39;s used to disdain. :)<br/>
<br/>
But he knows, as the kids know, that the disdain is for the game -- or those cars all driving very fast while turning left, what the heck is entertaining about that! -- and not him. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to suggest others should live the way we do or that our way is the right way and other ways are not. I&#39;m will suggest that our family dynamic allows for one way of doing things that may or may not fit with other families.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe you&#39;re missing what people are saying. Maybe your family  <br/>
dynamics are altering the feeling of the words. But there&#39;s a point  <br/>
being missed that&#39;s useful to building good relationships.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s useful for building relationships to give what kids (and  <br/>
spouses!) like a good try. And even if you decide you don&#39;t like it,  <br/>
to at least be familiar enough with it to have conversations.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve given something a try, it&#39;s perfectly okay to say &quot;I don&#39;t  <br/>
really like that show.&quot; And talk about why not.<br/>
<br/>
(For instance, I really tried to like The Office. I think the concept  <br/>
is brilliant. But I get a creepy feeling knowing the characters are  <br/>
all acting one way to one another and saying something different  <br/>
behind their backs. I *know* that&#39;s the point of the show and why  <br/>
people find it funny. It just makes me uncomfortable. But I do know  <br/>
the characters and can understand when they tell me something about it.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure my family can tell you what shows I don&#39;t like! I don&#39;t keep  <br/>
it a secret. My likes and dislikes don&#39;t dictate theirs. And theirs  <br/>
don&#39;t dictate mine. We all know we&#39;re free to like or dislike  <br/>
whatever we do.<br/>
<br/>
I find it useful to appreciate what they like about things I don&#39;t  <br/>
like. It gives use more connections. There are some things that I  <br/>
just won&#39;t be able to get. That&#39;s okay too. But I think the more we  <br/>
try, the better and stronger the relationships we have.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever useful for building relationships to  <br/>
label what someone else likes as stupid or dumb or boring or anything  <br/>
negative. There are gentler, kinder, more relationship building ways  <br/>
of sharing our likes and dislikes without using judgmental words.  <br/>
Even if the members of a family don&#39;t find the words hurtful, there  <br/>
will be other people outside the family who will be put off and feel  <br/>
put down. And that&#39;s a good thing for kids to know, even if their  <br/>
family is less sensitive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568432583">That&#39;s great if the personalities and interactions are such that it works<br/>
for your family.  There was no need for you to change what you have already<br/>
been doing.<br/>
<br/>
However when I was growing up what you&#39;re describing is how it was done<br/>
there too.  And the personalities and interactions were such that it<br/>
*didn&#39;t* do well (except for the last 2 children --out of 4).  I would<br/>
describe it as being nonchalant and sometimes careless and even cold about<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
While some families can afford nonchalance, many families have dynamics<br/>
where dismissing what others like grates on the nerves of the one who likes<br/>
what someone else doesn&#39;t and vice versa.  Nonchalance is often a point of<br/>
conflict.  And that&#39;s why the comment about a lack of interest not stopping<br/>
the world (who cares about what the world thinks or feels?) from spinning is<br/>
not helpful on a list of tons of people who might like nothing better than a<br/>
reason (though it might be a bad excuse for them) to keep doing what they&#39;re<br/>
already doing, which isn&#39;t working despite all the justifications in the<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Nonchalance for some is no cause for concern.  For others, its a *big*<br/>
reason the family stays conflicted and unhappy.<br/>
