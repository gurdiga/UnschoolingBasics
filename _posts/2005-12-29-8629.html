<div id="ygrps-yiv-843712653">for the links to books and websites that you both mentioned.  Ren, I&#39;ve <br/>
been all over the Path to Freedom website and it is absolutely REEKING <br/>
with great stuff :)<br/>
<br/>
Dierdre, I&#39;ve checked out the square foot gardening website and it <br/>
looks like something I can actually do.  <br/>
<br/>
I also found an inexpensive little pamphlet in a seed magazine with a <br/>
checklist of things that can and cannot go in a compost pile.  I&#39;ll <br/>
check out the redworms too.  I&#39;ve found a couple sites that explain how <br/>
they work. They sell them in the same catalog.  <br/>
<br/>
Blessings to you.<br/>
