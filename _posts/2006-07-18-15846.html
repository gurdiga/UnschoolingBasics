<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965215453">I brought this over from AlwaysLearning since it seems so timely:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Can I unschool and still have him accomplish his goals? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The question really is, can HE unschool and still accomplish his<br/>
goals?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Terminology reflects thought and belief.<br/>
Sometimes just a slight shift in terminology will release the mental<br/>
block that keeps people from understanding unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of examples:<br/>
Calling grown women &quot;girls&quot; instead of women kept women from<br/>
advancing for many years.   When someone learns to remember to say<br/>
&quot;women&quot; when they mean women, suddenly girls BECOME women in their<br/>
minds.<br/>
<br/>
Nursing and childbirth counselors and midwives remind women to change<br/>
their terminology.  If a woman says, &quot;My doctor says I have to...&quot; or<br/>
&quot;My doctor won&#39;t let me...&quot;  it&#39;s really worth interrupting and<br/>
asking them to change the words and thought to , &quot;My doctor<br/>
recommends...&quot; or &quot;My doctor doesn&#39;t believe...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If woman give ownership of their babies to the doctor, they will not<br/>
be able to make decisions and to act on their own beliefs without a<br/>
doctor&#39;s approval or permission.<br/>
<br/>
If parents retain ownership of their children&#39;s learning, the<br/>
children cannot learn on their own.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve just said above is / will be / has been misinterpreted to<br/>
mean the parents should throw up their hands, back off, and not say a<br/>
word.  That&#39;s not what I mean at all.   Possibly the very same<br/>
interactions can occur, but the balance of power and responsibility<br/>
can change by changing the phrasing and definitions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Can he unschool and still accomplish his goals? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is that different in wording only from &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Can I unschool and still<br/>
have him accomplish his goals? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s 180 degrees of difference mentally, and very little<br/>
difference in real life.<br/>
<br/>
Is it a change worth making?<br/>
I think it&#39;s absolutely necessary.<br/>
<br/>
When forceful suggestions are made here, though, sometimes people<br/>
take it as criticism or attack.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re trying to help push someone&#39;s car and it&#39;s not going<br/>
anywhere, sometimes pushing harder helps.  Occasionally, though, you<br/>
just HAVE to say, &quot;Is it in neutral or not?&quot;   If they say, &quot;No, it&#39;s<br/>
in first gear, push harder,&quot; what are you going to say?   You stop<br/>
pushing and say &quot;You HAVE to put it in neutral first.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So before anyone can enjoy the benefits of unschooling they HAVE to<br/>
&quot;put it in neutral.&quot;  They have to take off the emergency brake.<br/>
Otherwise the car won&#39;t move.  Too many people say &quot;We tried pushing<br/>
the car, it didn&#39;t move, we bought a new one.  Pushing cars never<br/>
works.&quot;<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>
They go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
