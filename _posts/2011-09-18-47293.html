<div id="ygrps-yiv-505597182">I just wanted to say &quot;thank you&quot; to everyone for being here and sharing your <br/>
ideas and encouragement.  I know I am an ultra-newbie, but I am already seeing <br/>
positive changes in my kids and it is so encouraging.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you remember, but I had mentioned my 10 yo and 13 yo boys being <br/>
very competitive and mean to each other - well, since I am not enforcing a <br/>
bedtime, they have been staying up late together to watch TV.  I have heard them <br/>
in there laughing, playing and wrestling - having FUN together for the last two <br/>
nights!!!  That hasn&#39;t happened in a really long time.<br/>
<br/>
Today I noticed my 13yo joking and playing with the younger kids.  For a while <br/>
now he has just treated them as annoyances, so I was really happy about this, <br/>
too.  I can tell he is a lot less stressed.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday the 13yo 10 yo and 6 yo decided they needed to exercise, so they spent <br/>
time running on the treadmill, doing situps and pushups!<br/>
<br/>
I have been loving that I can say &quot;yes&quot; more often.  A lot more often.  In the <br/>
past, I would not have let them use the treadmill.  While making breakfast the <br/>
other day, the little ones wanted to hold an egg.  In the past I would have said <br/>
&quot;no!&quot; but I gave them the carton and let them look all they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on...but I am just really excited, and really happy (instead <br/>
of stressed) for the first time in a long time!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Kristie<br/>
