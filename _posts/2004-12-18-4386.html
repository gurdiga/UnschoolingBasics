<div id="ygrps-yiv-166036925">Hi all,<br/>
I need some help here. We went to a neighborhood christmas party <br/>
tonight where they had presents to give the kids. Well, somehow we <br/>
weren&#39;t included in the drawing of the names when it went around <br/>
prior to the party but were told  to bring 2 gifts, so we did. My <br/>
kids were the only ones not with gifts at the end and the gifts we <br/>
brought were the only ones left. I know they felt left out. The <br/>
hostess eventually made changes so everyone had a gift that was not <br/>
the one they brought. My daughter, during this, said she didn&#39;t want <br/>
a particular gift because she had already seen what was in it. She <br/>
ended up getting another, then when she opened this one she was not <br/>
happy because it &quot; wasn&#39;t a big one&quot;. It was a music CD. A little <br/>
while later, following some sulking in mommy&#39;s lap, she asked the <br/>
hostesses daughter if she could have the one she originally was <br/>
offered and she was given it. She was all happy for a while. Then we <br/>
got home and she asked for the CD and when we told her that she got <br/>
the other gift instead she began to cry and plead to switch the gifts <br/>
back saying she did not know she could only have one gift. How would <br/>
you handle this situation? In retrospect I know I should have <br/>
informed her that she only got one (I had this fleeting thought at <br/>
the time but didn&#39;t act on it), but I didn&#39;t. So what do you do when <br/>
something like this happens?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I suspect she was overwhelmed by the whole situation and logic after the<br/>
fact wouldn&#39;t have made it better. It would have just been more information<br/>
in an information overloaded situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922881651">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So what do you do when <br/>

<br/>
I think you spend a lot of time giving hugs and talking about how sometimes it feels sad when things don&#39;t go exactly how we had hoped.  How it can feel like being left out when you don&#39;t really understand what is going on.<br/>
