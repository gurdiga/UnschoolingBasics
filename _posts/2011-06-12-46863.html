that&#39;s going to be hard to achieve through unschooling. And that&#39;s  <br/>
probably why unschooling feels uncomfortable to your husband.<br/>

school is bad and why you shouldn&#39;t like school either.&quot; But some kids  <br/>
-- like me, like your husband -- didn&#39;t hate school and may have  <br/>
really liked many aspects of it. But the enjoyment of school has the  <br/>
same flaw. Liking school doesn&#39;t mean every kid will like school.<br/>
<br/>
So to understand better why people get so strongly behind unschooling,  <br/>
it helps a great deal to dig into *why* people like school and *why*  <br/>
some people don&#39;t. What are the common factors? And how can that  <br/>
information be expanded on to tailor learning for each child so  <br/>
everyone can say they enjoyed learning?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s pretty much me too :-) I was a geeky kid. I loved  <br/>
reading, science and math. I watched Shakespeare on TV for fun :-) I  <br/>
went on to college and got a degree in electrical engineering so I do  <br/>
know the fear that only school can get you the (supposedly) enormous  <br/>
amount math and science someone needs.<br/>
<br/>
School can work well for kids who absorb information without trying.  <br/>
It can work well for kids who can pull an understanding just from  <br/>
reading about something without needing to experience it. That&#39;s me.  <br/>
That&#39;s why I did well in school.<br/>
<br/>
But not every child finds that way easy or interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Most people will say, well tough. They assume that school is the  <br/>
reason that some kids get a lot from school. So it seems like forcing  <br/>
yourself through school will get you what the kids who are good at  <br/>
school get.  But actually an enjoyment of the information and an ease  <br/>
of learning that way is why some kids get a lot from school. Without  <br/>
the enjoyment, without the desire, school just can&#39;t be the same  <br/>
experience for every kid.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is like school but tailored to individual learning styles  <br/>
and tastes :-) Unschooling is responding to each child individually to  <br/>
create an environment where they can experience the &quot;enjoyment of the  <br/>
information and an ease of learning&quot; so they too can learn easily  <br/>
*and* well.<br/>
<br/>
Even for kids like me who were drawn to the types of things taught in  <br/>
school (like math, science and historical times for me), unschooling  <br/>
usually won&#39;t look like school. It won&#39;t look like kids are learning  <br/>
the information that they (supposedly) need.<br/>
<br/>
But what they&#39;ll be doing instead of absorbing information is  <br/>
absorbing and building an *understanding* of how the world works.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a long long process for me to unwrap my brain around the  <br/>
idea that information leads to understanding. It&#39;s been hard because  <br/>
*my* brain works that way. I absorb loads of ideas, let them simmer  <br/>
and grow an understanding from them.<br/>
<br/>
But that isn&#39;t how humans -- all animals, really -- are wired to  <br/>
learn. We&#39;re wired to learn by trying things out and growing an  <br/>
understanding of how the world works from what happens. That&#39;s why  <br/>
kids play :-)<br/>
<br/>
 From the outside that way of learning looks inefficient. From the  <br/>
outside it looks like playing, goofing around, having fun.<br/>
<br/>
 From the inside it doesn&#39;t look much different! :-) It feels like  <br/>
play :-) But in the background the brain is making connections and  <br/>
expanding on a picture of how the world works.<br/>
<br/>
(A small caveat: When someone wants a lot of information about a  <br/>
subject right now, a class or an all-you-need-to-know book is a good  <br/>
way to do that. The reason that memorizing someone else&#39;s  <br/>
understanding works in that instance is because someone already has a  <br/>
bunch of questions they want answers to. They *want* the information.  <br/>
But without the questions, the information doesn&#39;t have anything to  <br/>
attach to. So learn &quot;because you&#39;ll probably need it someday&quot; is as  <br/>
effective as someone being made to read a book on &quot;How to make perfect  <br/>
aspic&quot;. For people like me who have a big internal drive to understand  <br/>
how the world works, even the book on aspic making might yield some  <br/>
gems ;-) But most people aren&#39;t like me. And forced learning for  <br/>
potential future needs is why most people hate school.<br/>
<br/>
Without the need, without the desire, the information is often not  <br/>
inherently interesting. (Except for people like me again! ;-) Being  <br/>
forced to learn what&#39;s not interesting often leaves people turned off  <br/>
to learning more about it. And worse, they may turn away from real  <br/>
life uses of it that would have helped them understand because it  <br/>
brings back bad memories of being forced. Which is why loads of kids  <br/>
will balk at doing arithmetic outside of class. :-/<br/>
<br/>
Just because we&#39;re hard wired to build our own understandings of how  <br/>
the world works, doesn&#39;t mean we need to build our understanding only  <br/>
from scratch. Obviously people have been improving on an understanding  <br/>
of how the world works since the beginning of thought! But how we  <br/>
naturally learn is by asking questions that intrigue us in whatever  <br/>
order we encounter ideas that intrigue us. And we seek out answers to  <br/>
those questions. Some of the seeking of answers will be us trying  <br/>
things out for ourselves. (We&#39;re naturally driven to do this and find  <br/>
it fun! :-) Some of it will be dipping into how others have explained  <br/>
the world. (Like asking mom or dad! ;-) Or reading a book.) When *we*  <br/>
get curious about a particular question we will seek out whatever  <br/>
means seems to match our need in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
What can be frustrating for someone who wants some feedback that  <br/>
learning is happening -- as schools must do to give to parents and the  <br/>
state -- is that the natural process isn&#39;t linear. It zigs and zags  <br/>
and goes off on more interesting tangents. And the zig back may be  <br/>
later in the day or ten years from now.<br/>
<br/>
And that zigging and zagging and those tangents don&#39;t look like  <br/>
academic learning for most kids. That&#39;s what can make unschooling  <br/>
really hard to accept for people like me! They look like playing. They  <br/>
look like playing hours and hours of video games. And asking  <br/>
questions. And drawing. And watching TV. And conversations. And  <br/>
listening to audio books. And playing with friends.<br/>
<br/>
For some kids the playing will look more educational like Legos and  <br/>
science experiments and completing 50,000 words of a novel in a month  <br/>
for National Novel Writing Month.<br/>
<br/>
But, here&#39;s the kicker: If the kids are exploring what interests them  <br/>
in a rich environment -- where they encounter interesting things,  <br/>
where their parents are interested in the world -- where their  <br/>
interests are taken seriously and supported, their understanding of  <br/>
how the world works will grow regardless of what they explore. By  <br/>
pursuing what interests them, they&#39;re making connections that are  <br/>
important to who they are, important to how their brains work,  <br/>
important to what about life fascinates them.<br/>
<br/>
For science minded folk, it&#39;s worrisome that not all kids absorb a  <br/>
great understanding of science through unschooling. But not all kids  <br/>
are interested in science. Not all kids are genetically wired to be  <br/>
scientists. But *all* unschooled kids will build an understanding of  <br/>
how the world works (including the science aspects) and grow a desire  <br/>
to know a bit more because they have the freedom to ask their *own*  <br/>
questions, to seek answers to what *they&#39;re* curious about.<br/>
<br/>
Kids in school who aren&#39;t genetically wired to be scientists, who  <br/>
aren&#39;t curious in those directions, don&#39;t get that freedom to explore.  <br/>
It&#39;s assumed by educators and parents that they&#39;ll absorb the minimum  <br/>
of &quot;what they need to know&quot;, but is that true? Are there long term  <br/>
studies? Schools only show kids have learned for the test. They  <br/>
haven&#39;t proven the kids have memorized for the long haul, and, more  <br/>
importantly, can&#39;t even demonstrate that the kids understand or can  <br/>
apply what they&#39;ve memorized in novel situations. What many kids who  <br/>
aren&#39;t drawn to learning by absorbing information certainly do come  <br/>
away from school with is a dislike of science and a dislike or  <br/>
learning and a desire to stay far away from learning more. And that in  <br/>
the long term is far worse than not having memorized information but  <br/>
not having your curiosity crushed. Kids don&#39;t naturally hate math and  <br/>
science. But without a curiosity in what&#39;s being taught, being forced  <br/>
to learn math and science (and literature and history) can make them  <br/>
hate those subjects.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a couple of real life examples from my daughter:<br/>
<br/>
When she was 10ish, we were reading a book that began with a joke:  <br/>
&quot;The town clock frequently told the right time.&quot; (Love that line ;-)  <br/>
She asked what frequently meant. Now at 10 she&#39;d certainly heard that  <br/>
word dozens and dozens of times. But it wasn&#39;t that she had *no*  <br/>
understanding of the word. It&#39;s that she had been building an  <br/>
understanding of the meaning of &quot;frequently&quot; bit by bit, refining it a  <br/>
bit more each time she encountered the word in a new context. But her  <br/>
understanding hadn&#39;t grown to the point where she was positive about  <br/>
the meaning of the joke. So she asked for a better understanding --  <br/>
for my understanding basically -- because the understanding she&#39;d  <br/>
pulled so far, the understanding she could pull from the joke, wasn&#39;t  <br/>
enough for that moment. She *wanted* to get the joke so she tapped  <br/>
into my understanding,<br/>
<br/>
In school the process would be to memorize the &quot;right&quot; answer:  <br/>
&quot;occurring or done on many occasions, in many cases, or in quick  <br/>
succession&quot;. And to work at understanding from there. But human brains  <br/>
naturally work the other way. They build up that understanding from  <br/>
lots and lots of examples from loads of different contexts. Once  <br/>
someone has loads of examples, a more generalized, abstract definition  <br/>
will make sense. School tries to hand kids the abstract before they&#39;ve  <br/>
absorbed an understanding from examples. And before they *want* the  <br/>
abstract understanding. Before they *need* the abstract understanding  <br/>
to answer questions they have.<br/>
<br/>
Real learning looks frustratingly inefficient! It *should* be possible  <br/>
to just memorize understandings (like  &quot;occurring or done on many  <br/>
occasions, in many cases, or in quick succession&quot;) and own that  <br/>
understanding, and make that understanding work in real life. But  <br/>
unfortunately it&#39;s not how (most) of us work. It works well for a few.  <br/>
It seems to work well for some (eg, they can spit it back for a test  <br/>
and they *think* they understand). It works okay for others who have  <br/>
to work to cram it in. It works poorly for others.<br/>
<br/>
And the problem with memorizing other people&#39;s understanding,  <br/>
memorizing the abstract, is that it doesn&#39;t give us an understanding  <br/>
of how and why something works in real life, and how and why it works  <br/>
better than something else, and how and why it doesn&#39;t work as well as  <br/>
this other thing and when you&#39;d want to use this and when you&#39;d want  <br/>
to use that. It doesn&#39;t give us the foundation of understanding that&#39;s  <br/>
summarized by someone else&#39;s understanding. It&#39;s *just* the summary.  <br/>
Someone else&#39;s understanding is like the label on the box. Building  <br/>
our own understanding is the context of the box.<br/>
<br/>
Once someone has pulled an understanding of something from a variety  <br/>
of real life encounters, it&#39;s easy to see how the (abstract) label  <br/>
applies to the contents of the box. Its&#39; very very very difficult to  <br/>
memorize a label (an abstract way of looking at an idea) and then to  <br/>
build an understanding to go inside that box.<br/>
<br/>
Related to that, the woman professor who taught Physics I in college  <br/>
said that boys picked up physics (mechanics) quicker than girls  <br/>
because boys had spent their lives being the ball. And that&#39;s true!  <br/>
(Obviously doesn&#39;t apply to all boys nor all girls, but it&#39;s true of  <br/>
many.) Boys (in general) knew how things acted in collision because  <br/>
they&#39;d *been* the ball, had hit balls, had thrown balls, had thrown  <br/>
rocks and sticks, had experienced dozens of different kinds of  <br/>
&quot;balls&quot;. So the abstract ideas presented in physics mapped to an  <br/>
understanding they had absorbed from experience. Most of the girls,  <br/>
though, hadn&#39;t spent years experiencing the way different things act  <br/>
in collision. So us girls had to try to imagine a picture of how the  <br/>
world works from a (mostly) abstract understanding of how we were told  <br/>
the world works. Which doesn&#39;t work anywhere near as well as real  <br/>
experience in a vast array of contexts!<br/>
<br/>
That realization hit me hard when I went to write a paper about the  <br/>
physics of a punch as part of the test for a black belt in Tae Kwon  <br/>
Do. I figured it would be easy. But as I delved into it, trying to  <br/>
apply the picture I&#39;d built to illustrate the abstract understanding  <br/>
I&#39;d gotten from physics class, I realized I didn&#39;t understand at all.  <br/>
The picture I had had been good enough to answer questions on physics  <br/>
tests. But when I tried to map it onto real life, my understanding  <br/>
revealed enormous cracks and holes. I thought I&#39;d understood. Tests  <br/>
showed I understood. But it wasn&#39;t an understanding at all. I had to  <br/>
start from scratch and build up an abstract  understanding from real  <br/>
life examples.<br/>
<br/>
(And the reason I did that, the reason it worked, is because I wanted  <br/>
to understand. Being made to understand in college had obviously not  <br/>
worked well at all! Even though I thought it had.)<br/>
<br/>
My second daughter example: I too was doubtful that kids could learn  <br/>
math from living life. Sure, they&#39;d pick up some simple arithmetic  <br/>
probably. But all those hours and hours of studying and practicing  <br/>
math concepts from arithmetic to calculus was not going to happen by  <br/>
living real life, I was sure.<br/>
<br/>
But my daughter proved that idea wrong! By living life in a world  <br/>
where she used numbers to tell her things she wanted to know about  <br/>
things that interested her, Kathryn absorbed an understanding of how  <br/>
numbers worked. And, more importantly, she absorbed and understanding  <br/>
of how the world works *and* how numbers could represent that and why  <br/>
someone would want to do that.<br/>
<br/>
And how did she do that? Video games were her primary  <br/>
&quot;curriculum&quot;. :-) Not educational video games! Pokemon. Super Mario  <br/>
Brothers. Animal Crossing. The desire to solve the puzzles and beat  <br/>
the game made the information presented in numbers useful to her.  <br/>
Pokemon alone has hundreds of charts and graphs that can help someone  <br/>
play better.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, she was interested in organizing collections so made  <br/>
databases and spreadsheets. (Of Pokemon, of dinosaurs, of creatures  <br/>
she made up. What ever interested her. I helped her figure out how to  <br/>
do what *she* wanted.) She was also into drawing on computers which  <br/>
presents a lot of information and ways to do things that are based on  <br/>
numbers. She had money to spend and wanted to know what she could buy  <br/>
with it and how much more she might new.<br/>
<br/>
Now she also did have a Dad who is interested in math but the amount  <br/>
of fun stuff he showed her was minutes of math, not hours. (And he  <br/>
didn&#39;t torture her with the stuff she &quot;needed&quot; to know. He just showed  <br/>
her fun stuff like Fibonacci numbers.) And I answered whatever  <br/>
questions she had, giving her the answers, walking through the answer  <br/>
as I figured it out. (Eg, I never made her do the math.)<br/>
<br/>
The point is that she didn&#39;t need an understanding of math to use  <br/>
numbers. She *pulled* an understanding of math from her desire to get  <br/>
better at what she enjoyed -- especially video games :-) (And I want  <br/>
to emphasize she&#39;s not a math geek. She wasn&#39;t doing math puzzles  <br/>
under the covers at night ;-) She&#39;s more of an artist and writer and  <br/>
musician. But she obviously does have the genes to want to understand  <br/>
how the world maps to numbers from both my husband and me.)<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, she *didn&#39;t* end up with a collection of knowledge  <br/>
equivalent to 4 years of high school math. But she ended up with  <br/>
something that was apparently much better. At 14 she took her father&#39;s  <br/>
college statistics class and was always one of the highest scorers on  <br/>
homework and tests. While she voluntarily chose to sit through his  <br/>
classes twice, while she asked him questions while doing homework, all  <br/>
the work on the homework and on tests was hers. She was in class with  <br/>
college students 3-5 years older than her who had been through 12+  <br/>
years of math classes and she did better than nearly all of them. Her  <br/>
pulled understanding was an asset. Their crammed in memorization was a  <br/>
handicap. (She also took Algebra and pre-Calculus. She made it through  <br/>
most of Calculus but the teacher was lousy and it became more of an  <br/>
exercise to get the math so she didn&#39;t have to do it in college rather  <br/>
than for fun as it had been.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying every unschooled kid can take college statistics at 14!  <br/>
She did well because she&#39;d grown an understanding of how  the world  <br/>
works through pursuing her interests. She did well because she hadn&#39;t  <br/>
been demoralized by 12 years of forced math. She did well because it  <br/>
interested her. It interested her because of genes (mostly) and  <br/>
because of an environment where math was useful and fun and never  <br/>
forced on her.<br/>
<br/>
She has learned well and profoundly about the world as long as she  <br/>
pursued what interested her. The learning dropped off when she was  <br/>
learning things that she didn&#39;t care to learn. The important thing is  <br/>
that very very little of what she did during her years unschooling  <br/>
looked like school. Most of it looked like things parents let their  <br/>
kids do if the kids have been good, if the kids have finished their  <br/>
(supposedly more important) school work. Since she&#39;s always been  <br/>
resistant to learning what she hasn&#39;t chosen to learn, it&#39;s a good  <br/>
guess that 12 years of required math would have handicapped her too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At the same time, though, those same kids will do just as well without school - they don&#39;t Need school to learn. What they need is support for the things they don&#39;t do as well on their own and schools don&#39;t provide those things. <br/>
<br/>
Absorbing information effortlessly is why I did well in school too - but conversely why I struggled more after graduation. That ability didn&#39;t set me up well with real life skills; those are things I&#39;ve had to pick up on my own while un-learning a good many of my school skills. <br/>
<br/>
That might come across as anti-school, but its one of the biggest criticisms of college professors and employers of young adults - and parents and teachers, too! Schools aren&#39;t designed to teach life skills and so they Can&#39;t, for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can do well leaving school if they go right into a situation where they have something like mentorship - and smaller colleges, Vo-tech schools, and with academic fraternities are frequently set up to provide exactly that, but not all kids know to take advantage of those options. <br/>
<br/>
Some kids get a bit of mentorship in high-school, as well, via a favorite teacher, coach, or club leader. The trouble is, schools don&#39;t have the resources to provide that level of support to all students or even Most students. And you can&#39;t know which of your kids will get that kind of support in school and which won&#39;t. Kids who are very confident and self-assured can end up getting little to no support in the school system, for instance, because they seem to &quot;have it all together&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling sets kids up with the kind of support system that lets them learn real world skills with a much higher degree of safety and support sooner. It&#39;s an avenue whereby support can be targetted to the real needs of individuals. That&#39;s an educational ideal! Its what every (good) teacher would like for her or his students - individualized support. <br/>

It could be helpful to your husband if you did some research into the education of &quot;gifted&quot; kids because it tends to revolve around this very issue. &quot;Gifted&quot; kids are expected to forge ahead in topics that interest them but also to need a lot of unexpected help along the way. Unschooling works along that same premise but takes it a little further -not just &quot;gifted&quot; kids benefit from an individualized approach to exploring the world, but all kids. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I loved school and academics and especially libraries. For me it was all exciting and absorbing very satisfying. I wanted to read and think and explore ideas, to know and do and be in all directions. I enjoyed it so much that I studied to become an education professional and didn&#39;t see any difference between school and education, thought of them as the same thing. But I&#39;ve come to understand that I was unusual to experience School and Education that way. <br/>
<br/>
What I want for my children is the loving of learning, the desire that leads education and living the life of the mind unbound -- not necessarily the Schooling, although if that works for them, fine. I was churched as a child and loved much of that in the same ways I did schooling. Now what I want for my children is ethical maturity, goodness, the morality and the communal comfort of connection with human transcendence -- whether or not they ever find any of it in Church.<br/>
<br/>
School and Church are forms of institutional support for (and increasing authority over) something that only has meaning inside each individual. To criticize the institution of school or church isn&#39;t to be against education or ethics, learning or spiritual growth; indeed it&#39;s often the opposite, arising from those who care, who would defend and return focus to individual support when institutions disappoint or worse.<br/>
<br/>
I started to write about these differences between School and Education soon after our first child was born in 1990 (at 21 now, she does, too!)and perhaps in a way your DH would relate to? Here&#39;s one excerpt, with more links to follow inside: <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Nurturing Intelligence on Any Surface. . .<br/>
<br/>
Surface players are out. Deep thinking is in. And yet, the nuance is<br/>
lost on an American system still leaning on production-line academies to spit out the next mechanical marvel.<br/>
<br/>
Versatility isn&#39;t a talent, but a desire to extend ability.<br/>
<br/>
. . .Where did Nadal find this spirit of court innovation?<br/>
Not at an American academy. Nadal&#39;s parents resisted that siren&#39;s song. He stayed close to home... far from the Nick Bollettieri-style compounds in Florida.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, Nadal grew up with dimension, was raised a chameleon... Nadal applied his eagerness to learn and adjust as he decoded the subtleties of grass during Wimbledon.<br/>
<br/>
Such court awareness isn&#39;t a virtue of American tennis academies. And the forehand factories are not the answer to the country&#39;s talent deficit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
. . .The Whole Game has changed so much over 120 years--were racquets made of wood then, or whittled whale bone, oh dear, not raw human flesh like the 11th century monks?? --that surely those early (almost accidental by comparison) greats would urge us to explore and adapt new ways of winning, rather than foolishly try to replicate skills and strategies from a different era.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t legislate exactly which intelligent and creative kids will become our new world champions, or why or how. Whether we forbid their changes and sanction their styles or not, all we really can count upon them for is one way or another, to leave all us fans and armchair brandishers awestruck at their feet.<br/>
<br/>
May they know the past without bowing to it, dominate the present without destroying it, and invent the future they can imagine, without giving any pontifications of our past-expiration expertise more than an indulgent grin.<br/>
<br/>
Pat the Prince on his balding pate and play ball!<br/>
I just can&#39;t WAIT to see what happens next . . .</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103670904">I don&#39;t have sites or books to recommend. I wanted to say that I can relate to your husband. Maybe you&#39;ll share my thoughts with him? <br/>
I put a lot into school and I got a lot out of it. My top ten list of inspirational people would include five public school teachers.<br/>
 We started out as homeschoolers through a charter school. I wanted that doggone advisor to tell me how many hours we were supposed to do something, how many pages, and what the best way was to hammer it into her head. It took two years to realize I was trying to cram &quot;information&quot; into her head, not &quot;knowledge&quot; she actually needed. We would open up the social studies book and talk about community helpers when hello! We had already met them at different events, heard all the in-depth information straight from them, and had a blast. The social studies book was first to go. It didn&#39;t take me long to realize math curriculum is designed to be used by thirty children and English curriculum was full of stupid stories that the kid had no interest in. I had to work on MYSELF. I had to step back and try to realize how much I DIDN&#39;T remember from school. For a real mind trip- find an online sample test for your state&#39;s mandatory testing and see how well you can pass it (for any grade!). I don&#39;t remember this crap, but guess what? I&#39;m still an okay person! In fact, on paper, I&#39;m an excellent person! I&#39;m smart, I know what&#39;s going on in the world, I&#39;m stable, I volunteer, I&#39;m kind,  a good wife and mother, I function well in society, I&#39;m capable of holding down a career, etc. I learned absolutely none of these in school. I learned all of this through being a person, existing and participating in society, and maturing. <br/>
I honestly believe that a child who is out of school learns these traits earlier. I don&#39;t think earlier is the goal, but if they&#39;re good people and citizens in their teens they will be excellent ones in their twenties! <br/>
All in all it took three years to get the devil out of me. We own curriculum, it&#39;s up to them if they want to pluck it off the shelf and go through it. When they ask me questions, we find the answer. We don&#39;t hold schedules or kill trees practicing rote-memory activities. There&#39;s simply not a need. The world is our classroom;  the bumper sticker on my truck declares it so! Lol! <br/>
My youngest is now kindergarten aged. An hour ago she brought down blocks (they are Math U See tiles we didn&#39;t use) and started stacking and counting them. She wanted to know what half of this hundred-tile was. We showed her how to find it and she figured it out herself. How could I spoil that self-driven discovery with a &quot;sit down, let&#39;s open up the book to page seventy. What is the answer to....? -I- personally can&#39;t. To me it is more important that a child cares about what they want to know rather than having an adult cram data in to their heads. <br/>
If nothing else, school as we know it is a relatively new invention. For 6,000 to 3,000,000 years, depending on your worldview, we have flourished as a human race with experience being our teacher. The greatest inventors and philosophers had nothing but equipment and experienced adults to work with and look where we are now! We are okay!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869004111">....one more thing....<br/>
My husband is finishing a university history course. He wrote a paper about Hitler. I mockingly asked him, &quot;did you write it like a third grader? &#39;Hitker was a bad man. He killed Jews. We aren&#39;t allowed to talk about religion in school so I don&#39;t know who&#39;s a Jew.&quot; We both laughed our butts off at how sad but true this is. <br/>
School requires such a high level of political correctness that I don&#39;t see a lot if it as effective.</div>
