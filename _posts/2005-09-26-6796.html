<div id="ygrps-yiv-423119673">&quot;Kids need to be kids! They need to play and explore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You just summed it up right here. Just read this over and over and<br/>
over again, and chant to yourself &quot;THIS is how children learn!&quot; until<br/>
you accept it deep within your being.:)<br/>
<br/>
Read the recent archives, we&#39;ve had some REALLy good posts about why<br/>
unschooling makes sense and schooling just shuts down real learning.<br/>
Read our &quot;links&quot; section too...I have all sorts of things tucked away<br/>
there, from essays to sites and more.<br/>
If you can swing it, attend the live and learn conference next<br/>
month...it&#39;s money well spent!<br/>
<br/>
The important things in life have nothing to do with anything school<br/>
related. How does one measure and quantify joy, peace and<br/>
relationships? Isn&#39;t that what a life worth living is all about? Keep<br/>
on reading...trust your heart, trust your children and STOP with those<br/>
damn workbooks today. Really.<br/>
