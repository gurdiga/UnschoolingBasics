<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244891641">Hi Guys, I am new to the group.have lurked for a year or so though. I have<br/>
been homeschooling for about a year (School year) with a public homebased<br/>
program. We are tired of worksheets! We are new to unschooling but I am<br/>
reading everything I can get my hands on. My son is on the autism spectrum<br/>
and has had early intervention since he was 2..so long hours in the<br/>
classroom. I realized that he needed to be out of school after countless<br/>
days of screaming, crying and melting down after school. He was so unhappy.<br/>
We have had a good year but I am ready to move on to greener pastures and a<br/>
more freedom for all of us. I have a 5 year old (will be six this fall) and<br/>
a 4 year old. My 5 year old is on the spectrum but extremely high<br/>
functioning so we are ready to put the &quot;diagnosis&quot; in the closet for the<br/>
most part. He still has outside therapists that come to the house to do play<br/>
therapy (DIR) and I find it has helped him...they follow his lead so I am<br/>
hoping it is not going to hurt. I am OVER behavioral therapy.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We live in California and I would love some advice on how to get out of the<br/>
school district and file privately spefically in California. We are in<br/>
special ed and I don&#39;t yet feel comfortable closing the door on them but we<br/>
only have 30 minute consolations once a month anyway. I figure I have to<br/>
notify them, ask for his file (?), file and affidavit, and keep some<br/>
records? Let me know if I missed anything. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343644558">Hi Kelli --<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest subsribing to the HomeSchool Association of California  <br/>
email list by sending a blank email to<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ca-Homeschooling-HSC-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">ca-Homeschooling-HSC-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
People there can give you very detailed and excellent California- <br/>
specific advice.<br/>
<br/>
It is probably too much detail fro this list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll see you over there!<br/>
