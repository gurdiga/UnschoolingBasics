going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do<br/>
theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to<br/>
be present starting right now. I drink my tea, breathe deeply of the<br/>
new day, think about preparing some yummy food they will love to help<br/>
start their day off on a positive note. <br/>
All this helps me really BE there when they awake and come out for<br/>
hugs. Those are the days that things really flow, that I&#39;m not getting<br/>
as frustrated (even when challenges arise), because I&#39;ve made a CHOICE. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038223773">I have really been struggling this week with different aspects of what<br/>
control means and when do suggestions start to cross the line. Yesterday we<br/>
were at the<br/>
<br/>
kids museum and every thing was going well I gave the kids the option of<br/>
checking out other rooms in the section we were in . For some reason they<br/>
both just<br/>
<br/>
stayed with me and the baby , she is two maybe one day I will stop calling<br/>
her the baby she likes it, anyway back to the event. I told Skylar that I<br/>
was taking<br/>
<br/>
Seth to the bathroom and didn&#39;t realize that she was deciding not to come.<br/>
She went off to a part of the museum we were not in or around this bother be<br/>
a<br/>
<br/>
great deal. I told her when I found her that I was scared not knowing where<br/>
she was and had she spoken to me and said I am going to the big ed that<br/>
would<br/>
<br/>
be different. But us being that far away still would make me uncomfortable.<br/>
I don&#39;t know how anyone can be that far away I would feel awful if something<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
happened to my child. Next we went to mc donalds to play cause we were going<br/>
to go to the park and it was going to rain. Well the baby was ready to leave<br/>
<br/>
and tired so I told them we would need to get ready to go cause she was<br/>
tired and it was going to be difficult to stay. They started screaming and<br/>
stuff and<br/>
<br/>
were no longer listening to me and I felt like I must look real bad. I<br/>
finally just sat right outside the play area and asked them to please get<br/>
their shoes that<br/>
<br/>
I would wait there for them. I did not want to go on and on with them. Once<br/>
I got in the car I lost it a little and raised my voice and told them this<br/>
was hard for<br/>
<br/>
me and I felt like they were taking advantage of the fact that I was giving<br/>
them more options and that they had to understand when we go out the house<br/>
<br/>
that in certain places that we need to behave in a way that is respectful to<br/>
the venue. Like I have and issue with standing on furniture I can not allow<br/>
it. How<br/>
<br/>
can I be non coercive and still help them to understand certain boundaries.<br/>
Like bed time they went in their room at my suggestion around ten the thing<br/>
is I am<br/>
bone tired and have had no way to spend time alone or catering to my own<br/>
needs and they wanted to keep watching movies past eleven thirty and I could<br/>
not<br/>
go to sleep it they are awake it is impossible at this age for me to do. So<br/>
I had to go into their room and tell them this. They really didn&#39;t protest<br/>
much and<br/>
<br/>
looked tired themselves and problem would have had trouble sleeping if they<br/>
continued to watch movies. So were is the like is there a way to help me see<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
I am dedicated to this unschooled I see I have more to let go but I am<br/>
running ragged and the only thing I am having time to do is sleep.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
by the way the twins are five and will be six in febuary<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026163333">&lt;&lt;and really think about how I will respond THIS day&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t agree more, Ren.  I think taking a look at those &quot;overwhelmed&quot; times and think about what was going on that day and how to re-work things can help.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I MUST be up a good half-hour before the kids if I am to be centered.  I keep items to do a couple different things on hand so if we need a shift of energy....things to make chocolate chip cookies, stuff to make a fire in the fireplace, a craft project, etc..<br/>
<br/>
I will also burn incense and turn on calming music.  My 7yo son is a bit of a rowdy and when he is getting tired, he can really be in other people&#39;s space.  He has figured out that the calm music to to help calm the house down and he loves rowdy.  When I turn on the music in the kitchen, he has been known to grab his ears and yell &quot;It burns, it burns&quot; until we dissolve into giggles.<br/>
<br/>
You know when you are throwing a party, you think about things like traffic flow, making sure nobody will be hungry or thirsty, making trash cans readily available, what we can do to make it a high energy blow out or a mellow cocktail affair.  I think we should do the same things with our days, with our families.  Set things in place to help guide the energy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-801125100">&lt;&lt;the twins are five&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I too would have been uncomfortable not knowing where my 5yo was.  This is very much a juggling act for parents with more than one kid.  You want to provide options and sometimes young children have trouble seeing beyond the immediate situation, seeing the dangers or problems their choices may cause someone else.<br/>
<br/>
I have 5 kids, I understand.  I think it helps to look at it from the kids&#39; perspective, think of how you would want it handled if you were the kid and then try to do your true best to meet everyone&#39;s needs and lots of their wants.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  Of course the kids didn&#39;t want to leave the play area at the restaurant.  They were having a great time.  So the question becomes, did you really NEED to leave the restaurant at that time?  Or were you just tired of being there?  How would you handle it with your dh if you needed him to leave something he thought was important to do something for you?  Try to use that same feeling, same tone of voice when you talk with your kids.  Would it have helped to talk to the kids before hand about how long you would be able to stay?  Did getting grumpy with them help the situation in any way or just make you all miserable?<br/>
<br/>
We go to the park every Tuesday with lots of friends.  The kids LOVE it.  Problem is that we absolutely must leave by 2:45 so I can get my older daughter to her job.  It isn&#39;t fair to make her late just because the other kids don&#39;t want to leave yet.  So we talk a lot about it.  I asked the kids how they would like the park handled since we absolutely MUST leave the park after ONLY 3 and half hours &lt;grin&gt;.  They asked to make sure we got there early....I strive for us to be the first ones there.  They asked to have a warning that it would soon be time to go....I give them a 5 minute warning and then go around and gather all their things for them so they don&#39;t have to miss play time.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is that it isn&#39;t so much the details of how you handle the situation, that will vary from family to family, situation to situation.  But try to respect how things are from your kids&#39; perspective, get their input if there are ongoing problems, truly listen to them and try to go above and beyond for them.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean that there won&#39;t be times when the kids still don&#39;t want to leave the park, but I know that I have done what I can to lessen the problem for them, I know they at least feel listened to.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Being sensitive to stimulation makes it difficult as a parent....I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think being very proactive in a situation like that really helps.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t wait for the &quot;overwhelmed&quot; thing to happen, take steps when<br/>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;re feeling calm and centered.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Having many tools in your toolbelt helps...like the stash of toys,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pam&#39;s chopsticks, new games etc..., taking time to sit quietly <br/>
&gt; with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; cup of tea or a bath when everyone is sleeping, whatever feeds your<br/>
&gt; &gt; spirit so you can connect with your children from a loving center.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have found that when things get tense, a short &quot;meditation walk&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; will really help re-focus my energy...or if the kids come along, we<br/>
&gt; &gt; all see new things, find our joy again by being in a new setting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just a quick shift into a different place, or different <br/>
&gt; situation can<br/>
&gt; &gt; really change the energy in the house. Going for a drive can do the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same thing. I have a big enough van to keep the children that are<br/>
&gt; &gt; having issues, FAR away from each other.:)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Being present isn&#39;t always easy, heck, I forget to listen to my own<br/>
&gt; &gt; advice at times!! We&#39;re human, we get cranky, we have hormones and<br/>
&gt; &gt; life issues and frustrations. Luckily, we also have an <br/>
&gt; incredible web<br/>
&gt; &gt; of support (thanks to technology) and a chance to do better <br/>
&gt; every day.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I wake up sometimes and really think about how I will respond THIS<br/>
&gt; &gt; day. Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while <br/>
&gt; they do<br/>
&gt; &gt; theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare <br/>
&gt; myself to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be present starting right now. I drink my tea, breathe deeply of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; new day, think about preparing some yummy food they will love to <br/>
&gt; help&gt; start their day off on a positive note.<br/>
&gt; &gt; All this helps me really BE there when they awake and come out for<br/>
&gt; &gt; hugs. Those are the days that things really flow, that I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt; getting&gt; as frustrated (even when challenges arise), because I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; made a CHOICE.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Every day isn&#39;t going to be smooth...that&#39;s just life. But when we<br/>
&gt; &gt; choose mindfulness, choose to be present in each moment, choose to<br/>
&gt; &gt; prepare ourselves for the most important role in our lives...it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to be good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295551964">we always go places without a time schedule and we were at the play area for<br/>
three hours the baby was tired and yes it was a lot of me wanting to need<br/>
cause of the babies<br/>
<br/>
needs she would have gone crazy cause she can not get comfortable there to<br/>
rest she was tired an just wanting to go home we left the house at 10:30 and<br/>
it was 3;30 when<br/>
<br/>
I told them we needed to leave so I feel like they had time and the baby had<br/>
a need that was needing to be meet maybe next time I should tell them when<br/>
we get there that if<br/>
<br/>
the baby gets tired we may have to discuss a time in which to leave would<br/>
that be better maybe 30 minute I could handle. We could compromise instead<br/>
of me dominate.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I too would have been uncomfortable not knowing where my 5yo was. This is<br/>
&gt; very much a juggling act for parents with more than one kid. You want to<br/>
&gt; provide options and sometimes young children have trouble seeing beyond the<br/>
&gt; immediate situation, seeing the dangers or problems their choices may cause<br/>
&gt; someone else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have 5 kids, I understand. I think it helps to look at it from the kids&#39;<br/>
&gt; perspective, think of how you would want it handled if you were the kid and<br/>
&gt; then try to do your true best to meet everyone&#39;s needs and lots of their<br/>
&gt; wants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Example: Of course the kids didn&#39;t want to leave the play area at the<br/>
&gt; restaurant. They were having a great time. So the question becomes, did you<br/>
&gt; really NEED to leave the restaurant at that time? Or were you just tired of<br/>
&gt; being there? How would you handle it with your dh if you needed him to leave<br/>
&gt; something he thought was important to do something for you? Try to use that<br/>
&gt; same feeling, same tone of voice when you talk with your kids. Would it have<br/>
&gt; helped to talk to the kids before hand about how long you would be able to<br/>
&gt; stay? Did getting grumpy with them help the situation in any way or just<br/>
&gt; make you all miserable?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We go to the park every Tuesday with lots of friends. The kids LOVE it.<br/>
&gt; Problem is that we absolutely must leave by 2:45 so I can get my older<br/>
&gt; daughter to her job. It isn&#39;t fair to make her late just because the other<br/>
&gt; kids don&#39;t want to leave yet. So we talk a lot about it. I asked the kids<br/>
&gt; how they would like the park handled since we absolutely MUST leave the park<br/>
&gt; after ONLY 3 and half hours &lt;grin&gt;. They asked to make sure we got there<br/>
&gt; early....I strive for us to be the first ones there. They asked to have a<br/>
&gt; warning that it would soon be time to go....I give them a 5 minute warning<br/>
&gt; and then go around and gather all their things for them so they don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; to miss play time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess what I&#39;m saying is that it isn&#39;t so much the details of how you<br/>
&gt; handle the situation, that will vary from family to family, situation to<br/>
&gt; situation. But try to respect how things are from your kids&#39; perspective,<br/>
&gt; get their input if there are ongoing problems, truly listen to them and try<br/>
&gt; to go above and beyond for them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It doesn&#39;t mean that there won&#39;t be times when the kids still don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to leave the park, but I know that I have done what I can to lessen the<br/>
&gt; problem for them, I know they at least feel listened to.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have really been struggling this week with different aspects of what<br/>
&gt; &gt; control means and when do suggestions start to cross the line.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yesterday we<br/>
&gt; &gt; were at the<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; kids museum and every thing was going well I gave the kids the<br/>
&gt; &gt; option of<br/>
&gt; &gt; checking out other rooms in the section we were in . For some<br/>
&gt; &gt; reason they<br/>
&gt; &gt; both just<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; stayed with me and the baby , she is two maybe one day I will stop<br/>
&gt; &gt; callingher the baby she likes it, anyway back to the event. I told<br/>
&gt; &gt; Skylar that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was taking<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Seth to the bathroom and didn&#39;t realize that she was deciding not<br/>
&gt; &gt; to come.<br/>
&gt; &gt; She went off to a part of the museum we were not in or around this<br/>
&gt; &gt; bother be<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; great deal. I told her when I found her that I was scared not<br/>
&gt; &gt; knowing where<br/>
&gt; &gt; she was and had she spoken to me and said I am going to the big ed<br/>
&gt; &gt; thatwould<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; be different. But us being that far away still would make me<br/>
&gt; &gt; uncomfortable.I don&#39;t know how anyone can be that far away I would<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel awful if something<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; happened to my child. Next we went to mc donalds to play cause we<br/>
&gt; &gt; were going<br/>
&gt; &gt; to go to the park and it was going to rain. Well the baby was<br/>
&gt; &gt; ready to leave<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and tired so I told them we would need to get ready to go cause<br/>
&gt; &gt; she was<br/>
&gt; &gt; tired and it was going to be difficult to stay. They started<br/>
&gt; &gt; screaming and<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff and<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; were no longer listening to me and I felt like I must look real<br/>
&gt; &gt; bad. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; finally just sat right outside the play area and asked them to<br/>
&gt; &gt; please get<br/>
&gt; &gt; their shoes that<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would wait there for them. I did not want to go on and on with<br/>
&gt; &gt; them. Once<br/>
&gt; &gt; I got in the car I lost it a little and raised my voice and told<br/>
&gt; &gt; them this<br/>
&gt; &gt; was hard for<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; me and I felt like they were taking advantage of the fact that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was giving<br/>
&gt; &gt; them more options and that they had to understand when we go out<br/>
&gt; &gt; the house<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; is I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; bone tired and have had no way to spend time alone or catering to<br/>
&gt; &gt; my own<br/>
&gt; &gt; needs and they wanted to keep watching movies past eleven thirty<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I could<br/>

&gt; &gt; they do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be present starting right now. I drink my tea, breathe deeply of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; new day, think about preparing some yummy food they will love to<br/>
&gt; &gt; help&gt; start their day off on a positive note.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; All this helps me really BE there when they awake and come out for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hugs. Those are the days that things really flow, that I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting&gt; as frustrated (even when challenges arise), because I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; made a CHOICE.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Every day isn&#39;t going to be smooth...that&#39;s just life. But when we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; choose mindfulness, choose to be present in each moment, choose to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; prepare ourselves for the most important role in our lives...it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; going to be good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Brooke. The kids&#39; sense of time isn&#39;t developed enough for them to  <br/>
have that kind of thinking - &quot;Well, we&#39;ve had a lot of playtime,  <br/>
several hours, and so it is only fair that we depart now, when the  <br/>
baby is tired.&quot; They live FAR more in the moment than that - as they  <br/>
SHOULD.<br/>
<br/>
No - that is NOT at ALL a reasonable expectation.<br/>
<br/>
If something happens over and over --- like your kids having fun and  <br/>
wanting to stay somewhere when you feel the need to leave -- then  <br/>
think outside the box and find a creative way to handle it. I do  <br/>
think it is fair to say, in advance, &quot;We can probably stay two  <br/>
hours.&quot; Then try to hold out at least as long as you&#39;ve said you  <br/>
would. Set a timer so the kids can watch the time remaining easily  <br/>
and the timer going off will be their signal that it is time to go.  <br/>
OR say, &quot;We might have to leave any minute.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it is really hard for them to leave - to make transitions - then  <br/>
talk about a &quot;way&quot; to do that. For example, you could say, &quot;Let&#39;s go  <br/>
to the car and have our lollipops.&quot; My oldest daughter always needed  <br/>
something to be going &quot;to&quot; rather than feeling she was leaving &quot;from&quot;  <br/>
something.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
At night, when I&#39;m ready to fall face down, I ask the kids to help me<br/>
get the house dark and people in their respective quiet areas to help<br/>
Jalen transition. If there is anything going on...he will want to be<br/>
in the middle of it. I really can only keep my eyes open so long these<br/>
days, even being a night owl.:)<br/>
<br/>
I have my time for me in the morning, when everyone is still asleep. I<br/>
know at night it isn&#39;t going to happen, so I prepare myself for that.<br/>
I think it&#39;s unrealistic to have alone time at night in a lot of<br/>
families, unless the children are ready to wind down earlier...I don&#39;t<br/>
have that.<br/>
<br/>
As far as transitioning from fun activities, we always talk about any<br/>
time constraints ahead of time. When Jalen was smaller, they knew I<br/>
would prioritize his needs if he started to get cranky and needed to<br/>
go home. Usually, he would nurse and cuddle wherever we were and I<br/>
just had to be on the sidelines a bit more. If he really needed to get<br/>
away from stimulation though, we left.<br/>
I would make dates for going back someplace they loved, or plan a<br/>
quick stop on the way home (somewhere we could just pick something up,<br/>
like Krispy Kreme) and usually that was good enough. Five is really<br/>
young, it&#39;s really hard for them to get outside themselves and see<br/>
anything beyond what is interesting right NOW..as it should be.<br/>
<br/>
I DO step in and &quot;dictate&quot; sometimes....I don&#39;t really like that word,<br/>
because it implies no discussion, something we do a lot of. But there<br/>
have been times that one child&#39;s needs had to be prioritized, that&#39;s<br/>
the challenge of larger families. It&#39;s constant negotiation, problem<br/>
solving etc...<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever just gotten the twins attention and said &quot;The baby is<br/>
tired and cranky, she really NEEDS to go home, I NEED to go home to<br/>
take care of her, what are your ideas for helping us all get what we<br/>
need?&quot;<br/>
See what they come up with. You might be surprised how willing they<br/>
are to offer options if you make them your partners in getting<br/>
something accomplished. I&#39;ve had the full range of &quot;I just want to go<br/>
down that slide three more times&quot; (ok, I can work with that) to &quot;You<br/>
can go home, I&#39;ll stay by myself&quot; (Nope, can&#39;t do that one)...<br/>
you get the idea though. Negotiate, state needs clearly, let them know<br/>
which ideas are workable and which aren&#39;t (and why) and I bet you&#39;ll<br/>
be surprised.<br/>
I think stating what you need very clearly also helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576240759">Thank you so much just to feel like someone else goes through this and under<br/>
stands when one is younger and sometime their needs are to be seen an a<br/>
priority.<br/>
<br/>
I really like you suggestion I usually say everything you just said except<br/>
what is you opion and now I see that I should do that and maybe offer and<br/>
extra 30 min time.<br/>
<br/>
I could have handle the baby playing with her without any melt downs for<br/>
that long. My husband has a hard time sometimes he hasn&#39;t looked into any of<br/>
this yet maybe<br/>
<br/>
he will but he feels we should not take them anywhere if they are not able<br/>
to respect the people in the place we are in especial peoples houses. His<br/>
mother can be<br/>
<br/>
real hard on my twins that really bothers me she always thinks they are<br/>
doing things on purpose trying to hurt dogs at her house. I know that if<br/>
they are thought to be bad<br/>
<br/>
by someone in a place that we are in they react the way they are expect to<br/>
by that person. So I really don&#39;t like to go places that people have pre<br/>
judged my kids and<br/>
<br/>
my parenting. My husband mom just sent and email to me about this toy she<br/>
bought the kids to be at her house that Seth took home cause he absolutely<br/>
loves it<br/>
<br/>
it goes to a huge set of pop ons and doesn&#39;t seem it should matter that he<br/>
keep it she said something about kids needing to learn what borrowing thing<br/>
and taking things.<br/>
<br/>
Ahh he wasn&#39;t intending to forget to give it back and I will take it back<br/>
next time he has lost interest in it so I could easily get it and take it<br/>
back and he would not notice.<br/>
<br/>
I feel she implies control and she seems to have no clue how a kids mind<br/>
works he is not an adult and can not be forced to think as an adult. I have<br/>
taken them to peoples<br/>
<br/>
houses with dogs and they were wonderful with the dogs they love all kinds<br/>
of animals and they are not premeditating to hurt anyone. She has made some<br/>
suggestions<br/>
<br/>
that she thinks Skylar would purposely hurt the baby I told her it bothered<br/>
me that she was saying this and that it would so far from the truth. Things<br/>
are not always this<br/>
<br/>
bad with my husbands mother but I don&#39;t feel she listens to me and respects<br/>
my feelings. She wants to force affection on the kids and gets angry truly<br/>
when they cry cause<br/>
<br/>
she hurt them by not really be couscous of weither they were ready for a<br/>
hug. I like it when she comes over here there are to many things I have to<br/>
worry about over at her<br/>
<br/>
house cause she tends to have way to many expectations. If there was a way<br/>
to talk to her about her approach maybe things could be a little better. I<br/>
think the way<br/>
<br/>
my husbands mother is has rubed off on him a little and it may take sometime<br/>
for him to see the affects of the new approach and relize we need to see<br/>
that we are so<br/>
<br/>
much like the children and we to can be irrational and we to need someone to<br/>
listen and not just demand for us to see it from their perspective. I have a<br/>
lot to learn<br/>
<br/>
I know how my husband works the more I addapt to the non coerion style the<br/>
easier it will be for him to do the same. He mirro&#39;s how he sees me treat<br/>
them. I will have<br/>
<br/>
to devolop even more patients in my life. This makes me feel tired right<br/>
know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654422352">Just forget anything I have said up to this point today I am so tired I have<br/>
turned into a jumbely (a word from Brooke&#39;s very own dictionary) mess. I<br/>
will be contemplating how I can change a lot more and not on how anyone else<br/>
can change to suite me especial the kids.<br/>
<br/>
They deserve what I can become if I truly internalize and let the best of me<br/>
shine though. I need to learn even when I am so tired I feel like my body<br/>
will fall on the floor and just give out to tap into that reserve of<br/>
patients.<br/>
<br/>
For more on words from my very own dictionary tune in. I make up my own word<br/>
cause I think the sound like what I want them to mean I will not give up on<br/>
these words despite the on going battle of Witt&#39;s they were crying out to<br/>
exist.<br/>
<br/>
See I told I am a jumbely mess today.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you so much just to feel like someone else goes through this and<br/>
&gt; under stands when one is younger and sometime their needs are to be seen an<br/>
&gt; a priority.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I really like you suggestion I usually say everything you just said except<br/>
&gt; what is you opion and now I see that I should do that and maybe offer and<br/>
&gt; extra 30 min time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I could have handle the baby playing with her without any melt downs for<br/>
&gt; that long. My husband has a hard time sometimes he hasn&#39;t looked into any of<br/>
&gt; this yet maybe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; he will but he feels we should not take them anywhere if they are not able<br/>
&gt; to respect the people in the place we are in especial peoples houses. His<br/>
&gt; mother can be<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; real hard on my twins that really bothers me she always thinks they are<br/>
&gt; doing things on purpose trying to hurt dogs at her house. I know that if<br/>
&gt; they are thought to be bad<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; by someone in a place that we are in they react the way they are expect to<br/>
&gt; by that person. So I really don&#39;t like to go places that people have pre<br/>
&gt; judged my kids and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; my parenting. My husband mom just sent and email to me about this toy she<br/>
&gt; bought the kids to be at her house that Seth took home cause he absolutely<br/>
&gt; loves it<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; it goes to a huge set of pop ons and doesn&#39;t seem it should matter that he<br/>
&gt; keep it she said something about kids needing to learn what borrowing thing<br/>
&gt; and taking things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ahh he wasn&#39;t intending to forget to give it back and I will take it back<br/>
&gt; next time he has lost interest in it so I could easily get it and take it<br/>
&gt; back and he would not notice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I feel she implies control and she seems to have no clue how a kids mind<br/>
&gt; works he is not an adult and can not be forced to think as an adult. I have<br/>
&gt; taken them to peoples<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; houses with dogs and they were wonderful with the dogs they love all kinds<br/>
&gt; of animals and they are not premeditating to hurt anyone. She has made some<br/>
&gt; suggestions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; that she thinks Skylar would purposely hurt the baby I told her it<br/>
&gt; bothered me that she was saying this and that it would so far from the<br/>
&gt; truth. Things are not always this<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; bad with my husbands mother but I don&#39;t feel she listens to me and<br/>
&gt; respects my feelings. She wants to force affection on the kids and gets<br/>
&gt; angry truly when they cry cause<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; she hurt them by not really be couscous of weither they were ready for a<br/>
&gt; hug. I like it when she comes over here there are to many things I have to<br/>
&gt; worry about over at her<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; house cause she tends to have way to many expectations. If there was a way<br/>
&gt; to talk to her about her approach maybe things could be a little better. I<br/>
&gt; think the way<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; my husbands mother is has rubed off on him a little and it may take<br/>
&gt; sometime for him to see the affects of the new approach and relize we need<br/>
&gt; to see that we are so<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; much like the children and we to can be irrational and we to need someone<br/>
&gt; to listen and not just demand for us to see it from their perspective. I<br/>
&gt; have a lot to learn<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know how my husband works the more I addapt to the non coerion style the<br/>
&gt; easier it will be for him to do the same. He mirro&#39;s how he sees me treat<br/>
&gt; them. I will have<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; to devolop even more patients in my life. This makes me feel tired right<br/>
&gt; know.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  &quot;Set things in place to help guide the energy.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; At night, when I&#39;m ready to fall face down, I ask the kids to help me<br/>
&gt; &gt; get the house dark and people in their respective quiet areas to help<br/>
&gt; &gt; Jalen transition. If there is anything going on...he will want to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the middle of it. I really can only keep my eyes open so long these<br/>
&gt; &gt; days, even being a night owl.:)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have my time for me in the morning, when everyone is still asleep. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; know at night it isn&#39;t going to happen, so I prepare myself for that.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s unrealistic to have alone time at night in a lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; families, unless the children are ready to wind down earlier...I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; have that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As far as transitioning from fun activities, we always talk about any<br/>
&gt; &gt; time constraints ahead of time. When Jalen was smaller, they knew I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would prioritize his needs if he started to get cranky and needed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; go home. Usually, he would nurse and cuddle wherever we were and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; just had to be on the sidelines a bit more. If he really needed to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; away from stimulation though, we left.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would make dates for going back someplace they loved, or plan a<br/>
&gt; &gt; quick stop on the way home (somewhere we could just pick something up,<br/>
&gt; &gt; like Krispy Kreme) and usually that was good enough. Five is really<br/>
&gt; &gt; young, it&#39;s really hard for them to get outside themselves and see<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything beyond what is interesting right NOW..as it should be.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I DO step in and &quot;dictate&quot; sometimes....I don&#39;t really like that word,<br/>
&gt; &gt; because it implies no discussion, something we do a lot of. But there<br/>
&gt; &gt; have been times that one child&#39;s needs had to be prioritized, that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; the challenge of larger families. It&#39;s constant negotiation, problem<br/>
&gt; &gt; solving etc...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Have you ever just gotten the twins attention and said &quot;The baby is<br/>
&gt; &gt; tired and cranky, she really NEEDS to go home, I NEED to go home to<br/>
&gt; &gt; take care of her, what are your ideas for helping us all get what we<br/>
&gt; &gt; need?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; See what they come up with. You might be surprised how willing they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are to offer options if you make them your partners in getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; something accomplished. I&#39;ve had the full range of &quot;I just want to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; down that slide three more times&quot; (ok, I can work with that) to &quot;You<br/>
&gt; &gt; can go home, I&#39;ll stay by myself&quot; (Nope, can&#39;t do that one)...<br/>
&gt; &gt; you get the idea though. Negotiate, state needs clearly, let them know<br/>
&gt; &gt; which ideas are workable and which aren&#39;t (and why) and I bet you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; be surprised.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think stating what you need very clearly also helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-942874552">I was badly abused as a kid so I remember quite well what it was like. I<br/>
have not like the way that I have be dealing with the kids but for many<br/>
reasons outside of myself felt I had no options.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have found unschooled I am dedicated to learn as fast as I can<br/>
today I really relapsed I just get crazy inside. I have a Harmony problem I<br/>
know it but because I such a butt<br/>
<br/>
I refused to take any doctors meds it will have to be an alternative med or<br/>
nothing serious I grew up struggling with some health issues nothing big and<br/>
nothing I have been given has<br/>
<br/>
ever helped. I am not sure if I should take progesterone or estrogen. My<br/>
problems started after my last birth any suggestions on where I should look<br/>
anyone else into natural methods of<br/>
<br/>
healing. I refuse to this problem for another and really that is what you<br/>
end up doing with so many modern methods. I think I should read my book by<br/>
Patti Diamond tonight after everyone settles down<br/>
<br/>
that will help provide me with the inspiration I need to be more creative<br/>
with how we get through our day tomorrow. The sun will bring another chance<br/>
for me we will succeed and I will grow stonger for the five of<br/>
<br/>
us. I don&#39;t want to take away anyones rights but I feel for know on if it<br/>
concerns my kids I might have to take a family member aside and say try this<br/>
they will respond to you giving them a choice and not deciding<br/>
for them.<br/>

Patience, yes. But also stating YOUR needs and letting people know you<br/>
need to sleep, or pause, or whatever you need right then.<br/>
Sure, we put our needs on the backburner many times with very young<br/>
children, but if you&#39;re their ally, they will want to help you get<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-255010544">The only options is her coming to our house my mom is a chucke cheese<br/>
grandma. Mil she is to self absorb and always having emotional problems to<br/>
take she wouldn&#39;t want to go.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly I have noticed her control issue go towards everyone around her and<br/>
she doesn&#39;t practice self control if she wants to spend money and has none<br/>
she will not limit herself<br/>
<br/>
She will also go out on the band by herself falling down endangering herself<br/>
for what to prove a point get her faster or I will hurt myself I am so tired<br/>
of the whole thing it is getting old<br/>
<br/>
I could be the same way and it just steams me up that she is unwilling to<br/>
take responsibility for her choices and give others choices when it comes to<br/>
her feelings. She lost her husband<br/>
<br/>
to suicide so if she needs anything she calls my husband and has no fore<br/>
thought as to what his other responsibilities are and if she doesn&#39;t get<br/>
immediate response then she complains<br/>
<br/>
to so many people it makes me seriously mad. My husband goes over there and<br/>
he does things for her and she is never thankful she just complains a day or<br/>
two latter about the next<br/>
<br/>
list and I mean list of things she needs and in her mind her is responsible<br/>
and her other two kids do nothing for her. Her daughter lives in London and<br/>
you could guess why, not my husband<br/>
<br/>
though he feels a need to deal with it cause what if she gets more ill and<br/>
does what his dad did. What a weight for him to carry mean while I kinda get<br/>
last in line for being taking care<br/>
<br/>
of. It is not that bad and I love him and understand him and think he is so<br/>
caring but it is hard when mil is so unappreciative I just want to scream<br/>
wake up. I have told her in the past that<br/>
<br/>
I feel this is the case and I do it very carefully but everything I say she<br/>
just seems to say oh I appreciate and not hear a darn thing. Her other son<br/>
and herself can not get along<br/>
<br/>
he will not put up with her control issues if she demand go look at the bank<br/>
and see all the work I did he says in a hurry I am busy got a go. I saw it<br/>
finally he feels like she is giving him no<br/>
<br/>
options. She truly is one of the sweetest ladies and I don&#39;t want to make it<br/>
sound all bad but sometimes I wish she would wake up so she could live life<br/>
more fully and have better relationships<br/>
<br/>
all around. The baby will always like her but if she doesn&#39;t change her tune<br/>
the twins will not ever feel bonded to her the way they do to my mom.<br/>
Because my mom has problems but she<br/>
<br/>
accepts them the way they are and doesn&#39;t care what they do if they are bad<br/>
by perceptions or good by perceptions it is all the same they are precious.<br/>
I know mil see this but she has to<br/>
<br/>
treat them that way and stop giving them bad looks when they don&#39;t hug her<br/>
they are so loving they would love on her so much if it wasn&#39;t scheduled to<br/>
her mind set of goodbyes hellos and when she<br/>
<br/>
feels like it without asking ahhh. Let them run up to you when they are<br/>
ready that is a gift that I truly enjoy. You know as flawed and a work in<br/>
progress I am I hear everyday from my children I love you mom<br/>
<br/>
You are the best mommy in the world. Crazy and I never asked for it once or<br/>
taught them how to say it like my mom did to me. I can really be a mess but<br/>
I see when I am wrong and work on it<br/>
<br/>
It really bothers me when people don&#39;t try to learn new things about<br/>
themselves. I don&#39;t need to be right okay I said it. So what is it worth it<br/>
happiness to me comes from learning how to complete myself so<br/>
<br/>
that I can be a light for others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604956686">I don&#39;t have 4 or 5 kids but what Ren says about letting others in on <br/>
what your needs are works even with small children.  Ds isn&#39;t quite 2 <br/>
1/2 yet and he gets it when I say I can&#39;t stay up anymore.. I gotta lay<br/>
<br/>
down for a while.  He&#39;s sympathetic to needs for sleep.  Most boys need<br/>
<br/>
a lot, going by the ones I&#39;ve met.  When I was a small child, I didn&#39;t <br/>
need a lot myself and couldn&#39;t see why people had to have so much<br/>
sleep. <br/>
  I&#39;m still not a good napper, which leads straight to a bigger need<br/>
for <br/>
night time sleep now that I&#39;m older, especially since I&#39;m experiencing <br/>
insomnia which I never used to have except in college, which doesn&#39;t <br/>
really count.<br/>
<br/>
Yeh.  Now I recognize how differently people are built, and how <br/>
important it is to make room for all the stages individuals in a family<br/>
<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
Going right into... of course ds can&#39;t always sleep when we&#39;re ready to<br/>
<br/>
sleep.  When ds was little I was rarely tired at all because he slept a<br/>
<br/>
LOT.  Now that he&#39;s older and more lively, bahhh ZZZzzzzzzzzzz I&#39;m not <br/>
getting near as much rest.  Can&#39;t imagine doing this routine with 4 or<br/>
5 <br/>
children simulaneously.  *Kudos* to those that do!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes ds stays up watching tv with dh.  Other times he&#39;ll lay <br/>
fidgeting until he can drift off.  If he can&#39;t drift off, he gets <br/>
impatient and dozey ole me (going off to a well frequented back burner)<br/>
<br/>
wakes up enough to talk to him about listening to the wind, the dogs <br/>
barking outside, the cars going by... I sing to him, recite lines from <br/>
favorite stories, and give him all those familiar things to settle down<br/>
<br/>
with.  Simply nursing no longer does the trick every time.  I&#39;ve just <br/>
lately started doing a lot of more talking him down to sleep.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149990457">Yep.  Ds is like that.  He needs something to go toward.  Maybe he&#39;s <br/>
goal oriented.  He hates to leave anywhere especially if other kids are<br/>
<br/>
there.  He&#39;s an only.  Leaving the library was really hard yesterday. <br/>
The kids there were showing him how to play games on the computer while<br/>
<br/>
he wore headphones.  We had been there quite some time, which didn&#39;t <br/>
matter to ds of course.  He cried to break your heart when I asked to <br/>
leave.  We had to get to the post office before it closed.  Dh is <br/>
working late this week and some overdue and soon to be due bills had to<br/>
<br/>
be paid (hence the post office trip).  Bills that aren&#39;t available to <br/>

Ds was in dire need of a nap on top of everything else.  It was one of <br/>
those marathon days I try to avoid, and I didn&#39;t do such a hot job of <br/>
avoiding yesterday&#39;s marathon.  I much prefer short trips here and <br/>
there.  I finally remembered the bananas in the car that he could go <br/>
for.  Poor guy.  It wasn&#39;t enough to give him solace for leaving the <br/>
library but he ate a bite or so then fell asleep before he finished.<br/>
