<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140798907">From Kelly:<br/>
<br/>
One of the things we would do IS model. If one of the boys wanted<br/>
McD&#39;s, I&#39;d go there; but then I would go to the place *I* found more<br/>
attractive. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily get a Big Mac (although I did on<br/>
occasion), but would opt for something better (in my opinion). If my<br/>
son asked why, I&#39;d tell him that I didn&#39;t want McD&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this lately because my almost 8 year  <br/>
old daughter has been asking about McD&#39;s, which she has not yet been  <br/>
to.  I like what Kelly wrote here because my &quot;intellectual&quot; brain  <br/>
goes to this place.  But, then, there&#39;s the gut-reaction side of me.   <br/>
The side that has read &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;, the side of me that  <br/>
politically, philosophically, and even just on a gut level, just  <br/>
can&#39;t go to McD&#39;s.  I know that this is my issue, and I don&#39;t want to  <br/>
put it all over my daughter.  I also don&#39;t want to spend my money  <br/>
there - it feels completely wrong to me.  I have as strong a reaction  <br/>
to McD&#39;s as I do to certain political figures/issues (not to name  <br/>
names, but just to give you an idea of how visceral it is for me).<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;ve acknowledged to her that I know that she is really curious  <br/>
about McDonald&#39;s, that she feels like everyone has been there but  <br/>
her.  I&#39;ve talked to her about the nutritional aspect of the food and  <br/>
likened it to something like hot dogs - something that&#39;s not good for  <br/>
you to eat all the time, but fine to have once in a while, which is  <br/>
the kind of statement that is consistent with our family  <br/>
nutritionally-based conversations that we have had in the past.  (I  <br/>
know that this is a point that we could also go around and around on  <br/>
in this group, but I&#39;d like to keep on the question I&#39;m posting here  <br/>
(for now - I&#39;d probably like to talk more about this in the future),  <br/>
if possible).  I&#39;ve acknowledged that the food does taste good, and  <br/>
that she will get there at some point, but that but Mommy and Daddy  <br/>
just don&#39;t want to go there because we don&#39;t like the company (which  <br/>
is something she has heard us say about other companies that we don&#39;t  <br/>
support).<br/>
<br/>
So, I say this, and then there&#39;s this niggling feeling inside of me  <br/>
which says &quot;well, what exactly do I want to happen here?&quot;.  Do I want  <br/>
for this to build it up inside of her, and then have someone else  <br/>
take her, and totally remove myself from her experience of it, and  <br/>
remove myself from a possible growth experience for both of us??   <br/>
That doesn&#39;t feel right either.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, what I wonder is what do you do when your political,  <br/>
moral, etc views totally clash with what your child wants, and you  <br/>
feel so strongly about this that you do not want to put even one  <br/>
penny of your money into the coffers of that world.  You can put any  <br/>
example here (McD&#39;s, WalMart, going to school, giving to certain  <br/>
charities, supporting political candidates, etc, etc).  Pick your  <br/>
most detested issue and insert it into the situation (if you need to  <br/>
separate it a bit from the exact issue of McD&#39;s, which can be a hot  <br/>
button).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980687727">Here&#39;s a bit of a different scenario and how I&#39;ve dealt with it. I detest<br/>
scary movies, I&#39;ve never liked them, even as a teen and have never seen one.<br/>
By scary I mean what is probably termed a horror movie. I can handle a good<br/>
action movie and some violence, but I just can&#39;t do the horror genre.  When<br/>
my kids started getting older and wanting to watch them I just cringed<br/>
inside. I was sure they would be exposed to horrible things and lose their<br/>
sensitivity and gentleness.  The oldest hit this age (early teens) shortly<br/>
after we embraced unschooling. It took me  a while to really get to the<br/>
point of keeping my opinions to myself about horror movies. I, quite<br/>
honestly, was pretty judgemental of anyone wanting to watch horror<br/>
movies. As it turns out, all of my kids enjoy a good horror movie. Even my<br/>
11 year old has seen a couple that the older kids deemed ok for him.  What I<br/>
have done is learned to appreciate what they enjoy about the movies. I no<br/>
longer am judgemental about the movies and I go out of my way to create a<br/>
fun environment when they want to watch one. I still can&#39;t bring myself to<br/>
watch them. I don&#39;t think I need put myself in the position of nightmares<br/>
and being uncomfortable. But I can still appreciate their joy and facilitate<br/>
a fun time. I provide snacks, extra pillows and blankets for those that need<br/>
to hide behind them during tense scenes. I keep myself available in case it<br/>
gets too intense for someone and they want to be safe with me (not that<br/>
that&#39;s ever happened....but just in case)  If a movie makes it hard to sleep<br/>
or someone has a nightmare, I&#39;m available without an &#39;I told you so&#39;<br/>
attitude.   I can support their desire to watch these movies and even be<br/>
part of it by providing snacks and a place to watch without actually<br/>
participating in watching the movies. In return, my kids respect my feelings<br/>
about the horror movies and don&#39;t try to get me to watch and when they talk<br/>
about the movie with me, they are careful not to be too graphic. And of<br/>
course, they are still sensitive and gentle....watching the movies has not<br/>
changed who they are.  This is something that seems perfectly obvious to me<br/>
now, but I really had to make a paradigm shift to get to that point.<br/>

That said, I dread going into the store-that-shall-not-be-named<br/>
(McWal-Bucks). And sometimes, I go into the store bursting with Joy at the<br/>
opportunity I have to be with my son and *show* him that my perspectives<br/>
need not be his own.<br/>
<br/>
I did the *let someone else take you* for a while. It was funny that Hayden<br/>
would go into the store, reciting the Walmart Movie, sharing that our<br/>
hometown store was in the film as we had an act of violence in the parking<br/>
lot (filmed but not witnessed--the movie&#39;s complaint). Mostly I realized,<br/>
when he came home with his jubilant bounty, that I had missed a wonderful<br/>
time with my boy because *I* held my ideals as priority over my relationship<br/>
with him. Here&#39;s a blog post from one of our most recent trips:<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve got more to share, how we have conversations about where we *do* shop<br/>
and why... our happy compromise :) Alas, the boy needs his &#39;puter at the<br/>
moment!!<br/>

When I balked at going to Cracker Barrel because they, at the time, <br/>
wouldn&#39;t hire gays, my friend (who was offering to take me there after <br/>
a long dog show day) told me, &quot;Kelly, you can&#39;t EAT politics.&quot; &lt;g&gt; At <br/>
the time, the comraderie and his humor broke my will. But his comment <br/>
left an impression.<br/>
<br/>

You seem to be open-mided enough to talk about in depth with her, but <br/>
not *quite* ready to take the leap and do what she wants. You may be <br/>
talking it to death!<br/>

<br/>
And it makes it all the more attractive---is that what you want? I <br/>
mean---it must be *REALLY* good if you&#39;re keeping her away from it. It <br/>
must seem to her that you think she can&#39;t handle it.<br/>

I realize that my child&#39;s (or my friend&#39;s) happiness is more important <br/>
than my politics.<br/>
<br/>
I *still* VERY unwillingly give money to the schools AND to politicians <br/>
(right out of my taxes) AND to charities I don&#39;t believe in (check out <br/>
your local electric & gas company&#39;s chosen charities!!!). I can&#39;t stop <br/>
where they decide to put *my* money. I *can* choose how much pleasure <br/>
I&#39;ll give my children. They grow up. They&#39;ll eventually learn more and <br/>
more about certain complanies and make their own, wise choices. But if <br/>
I make all of their choices FOR them, how will they ever be able to <br/>
compare and choose with their heads and hearts?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s more important to you? Your child or your politics?<br/>

everything can be looked at through a different prism that shows it  <br/>
in a very different light.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing I&#39;ve done is read, read, read, read, read. I go out on  <br/>
purpose and read books that challenge conventional wisdom, or my own  <br/>
assumptions. I read conservative writers, I read books like &quot;Why  <br/>
Globalization Works&quot; and &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; and &quot;The  <br/>
Obesity Myth.&quot; Just to remind myself that well-intentioned, well- <br/>
informed people can have radically different opinions--evidence-based  <br/>
opinions!--about these kinds of issues. It gets harder and harder to  <br/>
sustain a &quot;There&#39;s no way in hell I&#39;d let one dollar of my money go  <br/>
to that!&quot; position if you expose yourself  open-mindedly to smart and  <br/>
reasonable people who disagree with you.<br/>
<br/>
I also use an old relationship joke from my lesbian days. As  <br/>
lesbians, we used to joke all the time about how embedded woman-woman  <br/>
relationships can get. We used to have a joke about that medicine Co- <br/>
Advil: &quot;It&#39;s what you take when your lover has a headache.&quot; Ha ha.  <br/>
Anyway, my friends and I developed this joke that is also a good  <br/>
reminder about boundaries: we&#39;d wave our hands in a circle in front  <br/>
of our own chests, and say, &quot;Me!&quot; And then wave it in a circle in  <br/>
front of someone else&#39;s (or an imaginary someone) and say, &quot;You.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Me, you. Me, you.&quot; Just for a reminder.<br/>
<br/>
Now I do that with my kids. I&#39;m me, and they&#39;re them. &quot;You can&#39;t have  <br/>
that because I don&#39;t want to have it&quot; gets harder to sustain when I  <br/>
remember that they&#39;re _people_ and like any other person they may  <br/>
make different choices than I do.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See, I don&#39;t &quot;detest&quot; things anymore. Maybe it comes from having been  <br/>
wrong about so much during my radical lesbian feminist phase--in our  <br/>
family, we never say &quot;never&quot; anymore. My best friend and sometimes- <br/>
lover used to joke that she was going to get &quot;Dyke&quot; tattoo&#39;d on her  <br/>
arm, and if she ever decided she wasn&#39;t a lesbian anymore, she&#39;d just  <br/>
cut her arm off. Ha ha ha ha ha. He&#39;s a man now, and I&#39;m married to  <br/>
one. Fortunately, we both still have our arms.<br/>
<br/>
Having that dramatic experience of having been so very wrong about  <br/>
how evil men were and how inherently bad for women opposite-sex  <br/>
relationships were and so on, I am strongly conscious of my  <br/>
fallibility. I tell my kids what I think and feel about things, but I  <br/>
support their decisions, too.<br/>
<br/>
You said something as well about not wanting to spend &quot;your&quot; money at  <br/>
McDonald&#39;s. We don&#39;t think about money like that at our house, which  <br/>
is good because three out of four of us don&#39;t earn any, but are  <br/>
depending on the generous sharing of my partner. When the kids want  <br/>
something, I do think about it in the context of the family budget,  <br/>
and I share that information with them. Every month when I plan the  <br/>
monthly budget for us, I include a &quot;kids&quot; section, for them to spend  <br/>
as they see fit. It varies depending on other bills; it might be $20  <br/>
for the whole month, or it might be $50. But we also make decisions  <br/>
on the fly: &quot;Yes, I can buy you that Star Wars Lego set, but I&#39;d have  <br/>
to use some of the money I had set aside for eating out. That means  <br/>
we might not be able to order pizza like we were thinking of. Would  <br/>
you rather have the Lego set than order pizza? We could still make  <br/>
pizza at home if we wanted,&quot; or, &quot;If we buy that, there&#39;s not going  <br/>
to be as much for groceries, and we might not be able to get two  <br/>
flavors of ice cream. Do you think we can all agree on one flavor?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915790262">Dear Leslie, <br/>
<br/>
maybe it helps if you look at it from an &quot;educational&quot; angle: YOU had the chance to decide <br/>
on your own if you wanted to support McDonald&#39;s or not, and she should be able to make <br/>
that decision on her own as well. Obviously it&#39;s not enough for her to listen to YOUR <br/>
decision, and obviously, she needs that experience, and it might take years until she sees <br/>
the &quot;evil&quot; behind McDonald&#39;s  or maybe she just decides, she likes it more than she find&#39;s <br/>
it evil. Maybe, she likes it, but doesn&#39;t like the evil part and decides to do whatever it takes <br/>
to work there and take control of things, and *change* the things she doesn&#39;t like about it. <br/>
Or to sell OK-Burgers in her own store. The thing is, you don&#39;t have control over the <br/>
outcome anyway, but you are not helping her making that decision on her own, although <br/>
it&#39;s part of her human rights to do so. <br/>
<br/>
BUT, I don&#39;t agree that you should do whatever it takes to force yourself going there, if you <br/>
just &quot;can&#39;t&quot;. Many here said they could at some point, and maybe you can if you shift your <br/>
perspective - but maybe not, and that is your decision. But there are some other solutions <br/>
to that!<br/>
<br/>
Can an uncle take her? Can you invite friends of her over and let her have small party there <br/>
with two or three friends and wait outside in the car? Can you go there and be with her <br/>
without eating anything yourself? Doesn&#39;t she have some money of her own to spend?<br/>
<br/>
You yourself might need a process of learning which might involve going through &quot;have <br/>
someone else take her&quot; &quot;not eating but going with&quot; &quot;letting her go alone with friends&quot;, so I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t advice to do it although your don&#39;t feel good about it until you do. Though you <br/>
might be able to find a way to feel goof about it, but maybe just not and that will have to <br/>
be accepted. It will be easy to accept if you accept her way of living her life as well :-)<br/>
<br/>
Greetings<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don�t buy Nestles products. Nestles is about the biggest<br/>
food company in the world and makes money in all sorts of ways but it persists<br/>
in marketing human milk substitutes in ways that undermine babies receiving<br/>
their species specific food. Nestles contributes to the death of many infants<br/>
and the impaired development of many more. I don�t buy Nestles.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was recently put to the test because I had promised my<br/>
granddaughter strawberry milk but went to the supermarket that doesn�t sell an alternative<br/>
to Nestles s.m.. I believe that, in general, there is another way so I went to the<br/>
powdered drink isle and found a packet of strawberry Kool Aid. When I got home I<br/>
told my granddaughter about my dilemma and that we could mix our own strawberry<br/>
milk but that I couldn�t promise it would taste right. She was thrilled to mix it<br/>
all up and declared it delicious. Had the drink been a disaster and we threw it out, she at least would have known I respected her request as best I could at the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it is important for her to know me, who I am, and that, among other things, I live by certain values and convictions. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another of my standards is to respect other people&#39;s autonomy so I don&#39;t tell others what they can and can&#39;t buy. My dil does buy Nestles and I don&#39;t say anything about it either by word or body language.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I may get backed into a corner again sometime and I hope I can again find a solution that protects my integrity while also respecting the autonomy of others.<br/>

Breastfeeding is the biological norm for infants. It is a relationship that provides food, connection, protection from illness to the baby and stress reducing hormones to the mother.<br/>

a creative solution to your grand daughter&#39;s request.<br/>
<br/>
From someone who is nursing a 2 1/2 and 5 1/2 year old, I may change <br/>
the word &quot;infant&quot; in your tag-line though! Just kidding but I really <br/>
hope the day comes when the general public sees toddlers and young <br/>
children nursing as the biological norm as well (it used to be).<br/>
