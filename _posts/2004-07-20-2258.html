<div id="ygrps-yiv-940970810">Would you consider co-sleeping with the 7 year old? I have heard that <br/>
with adopted children that &quot;atachment parenting&quot; is an actual <br/>
philosophy recommended and esposed to integrating and developing <br/>
trusting relationships with new parents. Perhaps the same type of <br/>
philosophy of rapid response and non-separation will build the rungs <br/>
of the trust ladder for him. <br/>
<br/>
I think of trust as a ladder, if a rung ever does not support you <br/>
then you have to keep checking its integrity every time, for a long <br/>
while again until you trust that the rungs will always be there. I <br/>
didn&#39;t learn trust in childhood. I am learning it by consciously <br/>
trusting my son. You already have the philosophy and skills and <br/>
integrity, he just must test it a long time before he trusts it. The <br/>
process is happening even if you don&#39;t see learning. Just like <br/>
unschooling, learning happens even when we don&#39;t have tangible tests <br/>
to prove it. <br/>
<br/>
You might check on-line for attachment parenting adopted children to <br/>
get more concrete suggestions for an older child&#39;s adjustment and <br/>
development of trust.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know whether it is necessary or possible to backtrack, unless you<br/>
want to apologize to him for punishing him any particular time - if that<br/>
even applies. I think you have to honor where he is right now.<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn is afraid, we honor her fear, and do whatever we need to in order<br/>
to help her feel better including: picking her up (she is 4.5 and probably<br/>
considerably smaller than your son); walking the long way around the scary<br/>
object or person; turning on the lights; stomping on the bug; carrying a<br/>
flashlight even in the house (and she has her own collection of flashlights<br/>
and lanterns);  playacting fantasies of her invention where she is the<br/>
powerful &quot;scary&quot; creature or the hero/saviour; being with her to watch<br/>
similar but less scary versions of the scary thing as much as she wants(eg<br/>
she is terrified of the evil villains and larger costumed characters at<br/>
Disneyland, but still wants to watch the dvd&#39;s and have the dolls); walking<br/>
in and out of movies and live performances as much as she wants, listening<br/>
from the foyer, and doing a lot of peeking through the door.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn&#39;s fears include small dogs (improving), bugs, roaches, gnats and flies,<br/>
snails, sometimes the dark, Disney villains in the flesh, the explosions in<br/>
movies, and live theater. This last has improved with both Disney on Ice and<br/>
her dance recital, which she was able to watch most of this year. I think it<br/>
was a combination of loudness from the actors, a large dark echoey space,<br/>
and crowds. She also does way better in an empty cinema than a full one.<br/>
<br/>
She also gets nervous in situations where there is a physical challenge that<br/>
may be beyond her readiness, like the slide is too tall, or the waves are<br/>
too big. Again in that kind of situation we never push, or even encourage,<br/>
but allow her to make the decision without disappointment from either of us.<br/>
This is part of why she now swims like crazy, jumps in, and is learning to<br/>
do a somersault and dive to the bottom. If she ever gets stuck at the top of<br/>
something, I go and rescue her without rancour. At the same time I stay<br/>
cheerful and don&#39;t ever say a generalized &quot;Be careful&quot;. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-905207671">Childhood fears are pretty normal...and some children have them in <br/>
more profound ways than others.  There could be underlying reasons <br/>
for certain fears, but most likely it is just his temperament and <br/>
the way he responds to things.  My son is 5 1/2, who has been raised <br/>
AP from day one, has similar issues.  It sort of ebbs and flows with <br/>
him...I have always likened it to be that his intellectual capacity <br/>
is ahead of his emotional capacity (this is just my interpretation <br/>
of it).  Nonetheless, it can be very hard to watch your child being <br/>
fearful.  I do hope we can help him alleviate these fears eventually <br/>
by just providing him with support, comfort and security....but it <br/>
does get very trying.  Here is something from Dr. Sears&#39;s website:<br/>
<br/>
7 WAYS TO HELP YOUR CHILD HANDLE FEAR<br/>
Helping children overcome fears not only eases their anxieties, it <br/>
also provides an opportunity to build the parent-child relationship. <br/>
As you and your child work through fears together, he learns to <br/>
regard you as a valuable source of support. <br/>
<br/>
1. Understand why children are afraid. Children do not think like <br/>
adults. Most of the world is unknown to the child; and children, <br/>
like adults, fear the unknown. The preschool child cannot reason <br/>
through each new experience and decide what&#39;s okay and what&#39;s <br/>
threatening. As if the real world were not scary enough, the ability <br/>
to form mental images, which develops from two to four years, opens <br/>
the world of magical thinking with its consequent fearful <br/>
fantasies . Two-to-four-year-old children are able to recreate <br/>
people, animals, and things, which they are exposed to in real life <br/>
mentally, and these mental images may be scarier than the real <br/>
thing. The cute daytime dinosaur may reappear in fantasy form as a <br/>
monster at night, producing the sleep disturbances so common at this <br/>
age. <br/>
<br/>
The ability to imagine monsters without the ability to reason them <br/>
away as imaginary creatures results in a developmental stage where <br/>
little persons are likely to have big fears. Fears vary from child <br/>
to child. One child&#39;s fear is another&#39;s fascination. Some children <br/>
love to play with the vacuum cleaner. Other kids regard it as a <br/>
noisy monster that eats things. The school-age child becomes more <br/>
afraid of changes in relationships, danger, and health issues (e.g., <br/>
being hit by a car, not being able to breathe, divorce of parents, <br/>
or death). Children become fearful at different ages, at different <br/>
intensities, and about different things. <br/>
<br/>
In our family, once we started practicing sleep-sharing sixteen <br/>
years ago, we didn&#39;t have monsters in the bedroom, but Hayden and <br/>
Erin did go through a stage when they were scared of the dark . When <br/>
Matthew did not develop this fear, we wondered why. When it finally <br/>
did show up, he was old enough to understand an explanationwe told <br/>
him he was scared because his imagination was growing. He liked <br/>
being able to understand his fear, and it seems to us that he grew <br/>
out of it quickly. <br/>
<br/>
Fear is one of the earliest emotions, and with a little help from <br/>
caregivers, the child can turn this unpleasant feeling into an <br/>
opportunity for emotional growth. Learning to deal with fears is one <br/>
of the child&#39;s earliest lessons in dealing with emotions and using <br/>
outside help. Understand and support your child during these times, <br/>
and the closeness between you will grow. <br/>
<br/>
2. Give a fearless message. First, what not to do. Don&#39;t give your <br/>
child the message that it&#39;s wrong to be scared. To a growing child, <br/>
this translates into &quot;something&#39;s wrong with me.&quot; Avoid putdowns <br/>
like: &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid,&quot; &quot;Stop being a baby,&quot; &quot;Big boys (or girls) <br/>
don&#39;t get scared.&quot; These don&#39;t put out the fears they only drive <br/>
them underground. Now the child is not only afraid of the dark, but <br/>
he&#39;s also afraid to tell anybody about his fear, or seek help with <br/>
handling it. What began as a normal childhood problem is now <br/>
chipping away at his ability to trust others. Without reinforcing <br/>
your child&#39;s fears, empathize with them: &quot;When I was a child I was <br/>
afraid of a dark bedroom, too.&quot; Acknowledge your child&#39;s fears in <br/>
order to help her work through them. Strike a balance. Don&#39;t ignore <br/>
the fears, but don&#39;t get over-involved in them either, or your child <br/>
will play up the fear to get your attention. <br/>
<br/>
When responding to children&#39;s fears, give them two messages: It&#39;s <br/>
all right to be afraid; and it&#39;s good to share your fears and ask <br/>
for help. Reassure your child that &quot;Mom and dad (or trusted adult) <br/>
will keep you safe.&quot; Remember not to put your child down by <br/>
saying: &quot;There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s silly.&quot; Never <br/>
use or create fears to discipline your child: &quot;The boogie man will <br/>
get you if you get out of bed&quot; or &quot;God will punish you if you talk <br/>
back.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
3. Model being unfearful. Helping your child handle fears is much <br/>
easier if you are closely connected with your child. Your child <br/>
regards you as a test pilot. If something or someone is safe for <br/>
you, then it is safe for the child. Stranger anxiety is common <br/>
between one and two years. Help your child overcome this fear by <br/>
mirroring to the child that this new person is okay. Many children <br/>
become fearful of insects because they see an adult freak out when a <br/>
June bug buzzes by. Same for lightning and thunder. Try singing &quot;My <br/>
Favorite Things&quot; during a storm to help you stay calm. To handle <br/>
fear of doctors , prior to your visit, let your child explore a toy <br/>
doctor&#39;s kit. Play doctor and go through a pretend examination so <br/>
your child knows what to expect. Let the child play doctor with his <br/>
pet, doll, or stuffed animal. <br/>
<br/>
4. Always take your child&#39;s fear of caregivers seriously. Normally, <br/>
familiarity lessens fear. If your child&#39;s fear at being left with a <br/>
particular caregiver, even a relative, is getting more intense, <br/>
change caregivers. Even if foul play seems unlikely, give your child <br/>
the benefit of the doubt. <br/>
<br/>
5. Ease bedtime fears. Nighttime is scary time for little people. <br/>
Fear of the dark and of separation from parents is a double fear <br/>
that keeps many children awake. Put on a night-light. Parent your <br/>
child off to sleep with a soothing story, massage, or song. Leave <br/>
relaxing tapes playing for an hour or so after bedtime. Young <br/>
children need these helpers because they cannot use their minds to <br/>
overcome their fears. The child over four can be helped to work <br/>
through the fear of darkness. Ask him to tell you what &quot;dark&quot; means <br/>
to him. Encourage the child to draw the fear: &quot;Draw what your dark <br/>
room feels like and looks like.&quot; If you get a black sheet of paper <br/>
with an orange monster under the bed, you&#39;ve pinpointed the fear. <br/>
<br/>
The principle of gradually increasing exposure helps the child <br/>
overcome fear of the dark. Play dark tag, beginning with the lights <br/>
on in a room that preferably has a dimmer switch so that you can <br/>
gradually dim the lights. Play hide-and-seek at dusk, and let the <br/>
game extend into the darkness. Play follow the leader as you weave <br/>
around the yard at night on an exploring expedition. Initially, hold <br/>
your child&#39;s hand as you explore together. Give your child his own <br/>
flashlight to keep next to his bed so that he can turn it on to shed <br/>
light onto suspicious piles of clothing that turn into &quot;a bear&quot; when <br/>
there&#39;s no light. Sometimes just knowing that he has the power to <br/>
change the darkness into light is enough to quell the fear. Or just <br/>
leave a light on his room; it won&#39;t interfere with his ability to <br/>
sleep. He&#39;ll start turning it off himself when he&#39;s older. <br/>
<br/>
6. Chase &quot;monsters&quot; out of bedrooms. &quot;Daddy there&#39;s a monster in my <br/>
room.&quot; Is this a real fear or another trick for prolonging bedtime? <br/>
The empathetic parent treats the child&#39;s concern as real. Here&#39;s how <br/>
to get the child out of the fearful state and ease him into a <br/>
sleeping one. Let the child describe the monster and tell you <br/>
exactly where it is. Walk around the room together, letting the <br/>
child share his worries. Realize that fearing monsters is a <br/>
developmental stage in which the monster stands in for a frightening <br/>
world. Childish fears being what they are  illogical  an <br/>
explanation may not work. A more imaginative response is called <br/>
for: &quot;I&#39;m the dad in this house and I don&#39;t allow monsters in here. <br/>
He&#39;ll have to leave.&quot; Then you step into the closet and have a brief <br/>
talk with the monster. <br/>
<br/>
Do these kinds of responses mean that you have &quot;caved in&quot; to <br/>
childish behavior? No, they don&#39;t. They mean you understand what <br/>
that dark and shadowy room looks like to your child; your <br/>
recognizing his reality by playing along shows him a way of <br/>
mastering his fears. How else can a parent confront a pretend <br/>
monster, if not by pretending a little? <br/>
<br/>
As your child grows older, the problem with joining in on fictitious <br/>
fears is that you reinforce the idea that monsters really do exist. <br/>
We don&#39;t believe in &quot;chasing the monster away&quot; games once children <br/>
can understand the difference between real and pretend. Tell your <br/>
child matter-of-factly: &quot;Monsters are only on drawings or TV. They <br/>
aren&#39;t real. And even if they were real, Daddy wouldn&#39;t let them get <br/>
in our house.&quot; Draw a monster picture and show your three-year-old <br/>
the difference between real and imaginary. (&quot;Monsters are pretend. <br/>
Lions are real and Daddy won&#39;t let any lions in here either.&quot;) Since <br/>
we share sleep with our children, we haven&#39;t had this monster-in-the-<br/>
bedroom problem ourselves. Once our kids are secure enough at night <br/>
to graduate from our bedroom, they are past the age of being tricked <br/>
by their imagination. Even if your child sleeps in his own room, a <br/>
lovely part of his bedtime ritual could be Mom or Dad lying down <br/>
with him as he falls off to sleep, until he is old enough to enjoy <br/>
going to sleep on his own. <br/>
<br/>
Try helping your child imagine a substitute scene: &quot;When you dream <br/>
about anything scary, imagine a train at the end of your bed. <br/>
Whenever you&#39;re afraid you can hop on the train, and mommy and daddy <br/>
will be right there in the train with you. You ride around in the <br/>
train for a little while with mommy and daddy, and then the train <br/>
comes back and stops at the end of your bed. You get off, and you <br/>
crawl back into bed, and by that time you&#39;ll forget the scare.&quot; <br/>
Offering substitute make-believe works for the sensitive child who <br/>
feels threatened at any suggestion that the monsters aren&#39;t real and <br/>
that therefore you think he&#39;s dumb for even thinking about monsters. <br/>
The best way to get rid of nighttime fears is to prevent them by <br/>
practicing a style of nighttime parenting that helps the child feel <br/>
that sleep is a pleasant state to enter and a fearless state to <br/>
remain in. <br/>
<br/>
7. Get rid of fearful characters. Fear of fantasy characters is one <br/>
of the most common fears in the preschool child. If your child&#39;s <br/>
favorite imaginary characters are not keeping him awake at night, <br/>
bothering him at school, or making him a generally fearful person, <br/>
join in the fun, and let your child enjoy the fantasies while they <br/>
last. If they are interfering with your child&#39;s emotional <br/>
development, help your child work through what is imaginary and what <br/>
is real. The child under six has difficulty separating make-believe <br/>
from reality. <br/>
<br/>
Banish scary characters from your child&#39;s environment. Turn off <br/>
scary TV shows and videos. Even better, limit TV and videos for <br/>
preschoolers to very selective viewing. Beware of films and cartoons <br/>
that were created for older children and adults. Help your child <br/>
discern the difference between real and imaginary characters. Talk <br/>
about how cartoons and movies are made. Use puppets to put on an <br/>
act. (&quot;See, these aren&#39;t real; they only talk with your voice or <br/>
move if you pull the string.&quot;) <br/>
<br/>
Be careful not to transfer your own fears to your child. For <br/>
example, your toddler is climbing up on the counter. If you <br/>
immediately give him the fear message, &quot;You might fall!&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s <br/>
dangerous!&quot; he probably will fall. Fear can actually make risk <br/>
situations more dangerous. It&#39;s best to calmly walk over to the <br/>
child and assist him. <br/>
