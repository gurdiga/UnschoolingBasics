<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527453422">I am wondering how everyone &quot;introduced&quot; their children to <br/>
unschooling that hadn&#39;t been doing it all along.  We have been from <br/>
homeschooling to Public Partnership School to homeschooling <br/>
structured to unschooling in our journey thus far.  I have not <br/>
specifically told Adrian that we are unschooling and this is what it <br/>
is.  I&#39;d love to read him a book about it.  Is there something like <br/>
the Teenage Liberation Handbook for younger kids?  I&#39;d love to find a <br/>
book that directly speaks to the young child, he&#39;s 10, beginning <br/>
their journey of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

<div>My son is 10 also, we stopped 5th grade basically at the beginning of 5th grade!&nbsp; When we tried to make home like school, we found out just how much stress he had been under.&nbsp; So, from that point on , I told him, no more books, tests, requirements, studies, math, reading, and what we would do everyday would depend on what he and his little brother wanted to do that day.&nbsp; From that start is when I started learning about unschooling myself, and I&#39;ve shared what I learn with him when he seems to want to listen to me.&nbsp; I did buy him the Liberation Handbook, but he isn&#39;t into reading that one yet, maybe someday he will.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735501763">Is your son ready to run with the idea of unschooling? Has ha and you go through the deschooling process? Waht is is, something like 1 month for every year of school-including school at home-?<br/>
<br/>
I  really like the suggestion of starting up summer vacation, and never coming off of it. <br/>
<br/>
Jaiden and Avery have never been to school, unfortunatly, they are surrounded by well meaning grandparents hell bent on &quot;teaching&quot; them. I had never explained &#39;un&#39;schooling to them(the boys), we just told those that asked that we homeschool and left it at that, most people don&#39;t ask for claification. I also haven&#39;t even touched on the un part to my parents, just the idea of us homeschooling sends them all into a tizzy and we end up with huge arguements.<br/>
<br/>
I have recently started talking to Jaiden about the different ways that people homeschool, he knows that his day is very different from most of the kids he know that homeschool.  He loves his life and loves that he is free to play and make his own choices, but at the same time he is beeing fed the ideas of having to sit down every day and work in work books, and test, and get grades, all thanks to my parednts, so he&#39;s starting to have a little trouble with the conflicting ideas, and I&#39;m not quite sure how to deal with it, any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I helped you at all. :)<br/>
<br/>
I think the best way to introduce kids that are new to unschooling is to start summer vacation, let them be for as long as they need to be, and you work on you, read, read(all about unschooling), play with your son, be silly, try new foods, read, watch movies, discover your passions, read some more, listen to new music, listen to old music, watch the clouds, discover new places in your town, read, go to the confrence if you can, read, play, play play. And anything else you can think of. <br/>
<br/>
By that time, you wont have to introduce unschooling, you&#39;ll be living it. <br/>
<br/>
And if you feel doubts creeping in, come here and we&#39;ll talk ya down. and if the desire to test/quiz your son creeps in, I sugest runn to ivillage.com and taking as many of their online quizes as YOU can, untill the desire passes, if you make it through all of them, with out realizing how pointless quizes are...go to google and type in online quizes you&#39;ll be busy for months :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492824115">&lt;&lt;I have recently started talking to Jaiden about the different ways <br/>

ideas?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The only idea I can say at this time is to continue talking to him.  <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s time to explain a little bit more about YOUR philosophy of <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling and be a little bit more detailed about the <br/>
specifics.  If you&#39;ve laid the ground work already this should be <br/>
rather easy.  It&#39;s probably important for him to know that your <br/>
parents mean well and are just reacting the way that they know to be <br/>
true.  However, this does vary from your personal reality.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m not sure if I helped you at all. :)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it helps just to hear how others do things.  It is always <br/>
beneficial just to share a glimpse into what others do with their <br/>
children and how they respond to questions and deal with those <br/>
outside of the immediate family.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;I think the best way to introduce kids that are new to unschooling <br/>
is to start summer vacation, let them be for as long as they need to <br/>
be, and you work on you, read, read(all about unschooling), play with <br/>

confrence if you can, read, play, play play. And anything else you <br/>
can think of. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So, what you are saying is that reading and playing are very <br/>
important?  :):):)JK:):):)  I agree 100%!  Fortunately, Adrian just <br/>
loves to be read to.  I do have to watch what I read, though.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t like me to read anything to him that he can tell was <br/>
specifically written for an adult.  We are currently on book number <br/>
seven in A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS.  He just loves those books.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And if you feel doubts creeping in, come here and we&#39;ll talk ya <br/>
down. and if the desire to test/quiz your son creeps in, I sugest <br/>
runn to ivillage.com and taking as many of their online quizes as YOU <br/>
can, untill the desire passes, if you make it through all of them, <br/>
with out realizing how pointless quizes are...go to google and type <br/>

<br/>
I do have that whole useless testing thing down.  That&#39;s one thing I <br/>
never did even when we were structured in our days.  Adrian&#39;s <br/>
officially been home for a year and a half, and we have been <br/>
unschooling for about six months.  We are quite a ways through the <br/>
deschooling phase.  We are both adjusting quite well, so far.  <br/>
<br/>

Yes, it did help!  Thanks, Rebecca...<br/>

<br/>
I just had to comment on your above quote.  I noticed the very first <br/>
time I read one of your posts.  Adrian has recently gotten into <br/>
Calvin and Hobbes comics.  They just crack him up.  I even started <br/>
reading them.  Boy are they hilarious!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again! - Tina</div>
