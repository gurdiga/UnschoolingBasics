<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787147800">So I found out today that my son who is 9 years old has found out  <br/>
about online porn. Eeek! And apparently his friend wanted to look at  <br/>
porn when he was over here.  I was checking his online history and it  <br/>
showed it all the way from 3 days ago. At first he lied and said it  <br/>
was his friend but then when I saw it was from 3 days ago he then said  <br/>
he was sorry and that his brain is making him do it. I was quiet the  <br/>
whole time because I don&#39;t know what to say. He then said he was a bad  <br/>
kid and started crying. I told him he was not a bad kid. I think I&#39;m  <br/>
definitely going to have to talk to him about the birds and the bees.  <br/>
Or have Dh talk to him about it. He;s my oldest child and honestly i  <br/>
don&#39;t know how to go about this at all. I don&#39;t want him to have that  <br/>
stuff in his head or try to do this with other kids but I also know  <br/>
that even if I try to take it away he could still find it somehow.  <br/>
What do I do?<br/>

 <br/>
Puberty and sexuality is occurring younger and younger.  Girls are starting<br/>
their cycles as early as ten and boys are beginning to have physical reactions<br/>
to certain images early, too.<br/>
 <br/>
My son has always been attracted to breasts.  (My spouse blames that on<br/>
breast feeding.)  Once when he was around five maybe six, he saw a commercial<br/>
were the older sister switched her little brother&#39;s brain with the family dog&#39;s.<br/>
My son told me that he would love to do that with his oldest sister so he could<br/>
see what she looked like naked without her yelling at him. She was starting<br/>
to develop and he was simply curious.<br/>
 <br/>
I agree with the open and continuous conversations that just encompass life in<br/>
all it&#39;s aspects. My son is ten and already knows the internal working parts of <br/>
both male and female, how reproduction works, sex (we live on a breeding farm),<br/>
the changes that he will be progressing through, natural urges....and his responsibilities<br/>
towards his part in the equation.  Granted, it helped that he has watched many animals<br/>
be born, grow and play, then become hormone crazed teenagers, then parents.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any book recommendations but I&#39;m sure someone on here will be able<br/>
to steer you to some great reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798971885">Hallo stephanie,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t write very often here. But here I have the feeling I have to react.<br/>
Sorry for my English, I&#39;m from Holland.<br/>
<br/>
My first reaction was, why do you check his history?? In my opinion that&#39;s<br/>
an invasion of his privacy. And of course he feels bad. You have been<br/>
checking up on him and you have been asking him about it. Or did you ask him<br/>
about all the sites you saw in his history?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My son is also 9 and looking at porn for about a year now. First he didin&#39;t<br/>
wanted to talk about it but now he&#39;s more open about it. He used to be<br/>
ashamed when he saw me and my dh kissing but now he also free to see that as<br/>
normal and he can talk about intamicy and sex as normal subjects. It is more<br/>
how you react to it. When you act like sex is something to hide he will feel<br/>
he has to do the same thing. When you talk about it just like you talk about<br/>
the weather it wil be something normal to him too.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We made some changes in our house to make sex more normal. For instance we<br/>
used to dress our selves in private. Now when we want to change clothes we<br/>
just say I&#39;m going to get undressed if you don&#39;t want to see me naked please<br/>
look away. At first they looked away, then they got curious and peeked and<br/>
now nobody is really interested anymore and the naked body is just as normal<br/>
as a dressed one. <br/>
<br/>
Also we made porn just as available as cartoons. It&#39;s the same thing<br/>
:entertainment. If someone wants to watch it, it is there. Don&#39;t get me<br/>
wrong, sex is still something you enjoy privately alone or with someone who<br/>
want&#39;s to be with you too.but there is nothing to be ashamed about. It is a<br/>
way to love yourself to learn about your feelings and your body (and others<br/>
ofcourseJ). And there is no pesific(?) age for sex just as there is no age<br/>
for reading, walking,talking, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You say you don&#39;t want all that stuff in his head. What stuff??? That sex<br/>
can make you feel really really good?  That it is ok to be comfortable with<br/>
your body(I don&#39;t think a pornstar is ashamed of his/her body)? That lust is<br/>
ok? That having sex without a marriage is ok? That sex with more people is<br/>
ok? What is it that makes you feel that porn is bad for you/ your child.?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And why do you think he will have sex right now? Because he watches it? It<br/>
is the same with movies and videogames. Because you see something it doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean that you have to do it.  Even children have a mind of their ownJ . just<br/>
like you and me they can deside wheather they want to do something or not.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Hang in there.  I can relate to the &#39;feeling like divorcing him sometimes&#39;<br/>
but for me it&#39;s been over his mother living with us not the kids.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve also heard the &#39;do what you what, you will anyway&#39; which from<br/>
reading on this list, I&#39;ve come to associate means I&#39;m not respecting his<br/>
opinions?   I&#39;ve been thinking that, maybe, along with de-schooling our kids,<br/>
and ourselves, we also need to apply the &#39;peaceful parenting&#39; ideas to our <br/>
spouses, too.  We&#39;ve been unschooling for a few years now, and now my<br/>
spouse explains unschooling to others!  It can happen.<br/>
 <br/>
Have you asked your spouse how he learned about sex, life, respect in<br/>
relationships?  And how it effected his maturing?  How did he feel about<br/>
being punished?  Would a month of no Internet have stopped him from<br/>
&#39;researching&#39; something he was curious about even though his parents<br/>
told him not to be?<br/>
<br/>
As a friend always tells me when I&#39;m ready to scream, &quot;This too shall pass.&quot;<br/>

will not. What it probably will do is make him feel ashamed and even <br/>
less likely to come to his parents for information and advice.<br/>
<br/>
I went through this with my oldest son and I totally freaked out. I <br/>
was concerned not about the &quot;normal&quot; sex he might see on the <br/>
internet but the violent and extremely perverted (for lack of a <br/>
better description) and about computer viruses. We put blocks on the <br/>
computer. He found ways around them. We took his computer away. He <br/>
found ways to get his computer back when we weren&#39;t home. He still <br/>
found ways to see porn. All we ended up with was a lot of fighting <br/>
and everyone being miserable. Nothing good came from us trying to <br/>
control him.<br/>
<br/>
We have always had an open relationship/ongoing discussion about sex <br/>
so it wasn&#39;t like he didn&#39;t know anything. He was just a normal, <br/>
curious person. I talked to him about what he saw and he said he <br/>
wasn&#39;t interested in the &quot;wierd&quot; stuff. He mostly looked at anime <br/>
porn (which I found wierd but that&#39;s another subject).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really have any suggestions of how to handle things. I just <br/>
know from experience that punishment and shame most likely won&#39;t <br/>
have the result your dh wants.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a good place to start. Perhaps with &quot;Son, I&#39;m sorry. We haven&#39;t been <br/>
honest with you about this big huge part of life because we&#39;re scared to death <br/>
about how to talk about it, but we&#39;re going to try hard to do better in the <br/>
future. We hope you&#39;ll trust us again soon.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It would be a really good idea for you and your husband to think about what <br/>
you mean by trust and honesty before you talk to your kid, for sure. How <br/>
exactly did your son break a trust? What would honesty look like in this situation? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-722305742">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only been lurking up to now, but this post really made me want <br/>
to comment.<br/>
<br/>
Like another poster said, I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s because I&#39;m <br/>
European, but I really can&#39;t see the problem. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s <br/>
anything wrong with your DS looking at porn. It&#39;s perfectly natural <br/>
to be curious and it doesn&#39;t mean at all that he&#39;s going to go out <br/>
there and have lots of sex. I remember when I was a kid the curious <br/>
stage preceded the doing-it stage by quite a few years!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would take this opportunity for DH to ask DS if he wanted <br/>
to talk about anything sex/relationship related or anything else that <br/>
may be on his mind. That would open the door for him to ask questions <br/>
and also build up a relationship with his dad ready for those teenage <br/>
years. He may very well not want to talk about sex, girlfriends etc. <br/>
but just knowing that he could will make a big difference to him. I <br/>
think you should definitely take this discovery and rather than tell <br/>
him off (after all YOU&#39;re the one that invaded his privacy!), turn it <br/>
into something positive!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&gt; about online porn. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my oldest son was 8, I found him googling images of &quot;boobies&quot; <br/>
and &quot;buts&quot;.  We&#39;ve always been pretty open about sex and bodies.  <br/>
Instead of jumping to &quot;How could my boy be doing this?&quot;  I just <br/>
assumed he was experiencing natural curiosity.  At the same time I <br/>
was concerned about some of the images he could accidentally stumble <br/>
upon.  That is what we talked about.  I told him about the fact that <br/>
there are pictures on the internet that he probably doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
see, and they could come up in his search.  We talked about <br/>
pedophiles, and my boy very adamently said he did not want to see <br/>
anything like that.  I told him I would be happy to buy him a book <br/>
with naked bodies that would not have anything that he didn&#39;t want to <br/>
see.  This worked for us.  He was never shamed or made to feel like <br/>
he was doing something dirty.  He also clearly understood my concern <br/>
was not about what he was doing, but rather about what other people <br/>
were posting on the internet.  I wasn&#39;t forbidding anything - I was <br/>
merely helping him maintain the level of childhood inocence that he <br/>
wanted to have.<br/>
<br/>
Your son is expressing an interest in sex.  What would you do if he <br/>
suddenly expressed an interest in jet airplanes?  Would you shame him <br/>
for this?  Both are equally appropriate interests for pre-adolescent <br/>
boys.  In both cases, you determine the degree of interest and help <br/>
procure appropriate resources.<br/>

Just a quick note to say how much I loved your response. To point out that<br/>
eeven though there&#39;s nothing wrong with his interest, but there are other<br/>
issues lurking on the internet, regarding pornography, but that you could<br/>
help him with his healthy interest by giving him access to images of nude<br/>
bodies that were not likely to be overly explicit or open him to the<br/>
possibility of pedophiles was a great response.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks so much...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876660970">The ideas about sexuality don&#39;t bother me when it comes to porn.  Sex is<br/>
great and natural.  We talk about it all the time in our home.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What is an issue is the exaggerated way in which sex is portrayed in<br/>
pornography.  Many young men (and women) think that that&#39;s how sex is<br/>
&quot;done&quot;.  It puts in their minds the expectations of what sex should be<br/>
like/look like.  And visual images last much longer in the mind.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There is also the body image piece to contend with.  Human beings have so<br/>
much to deal with when it comes to how we &quot;should&quot; look.  Porn is<br/>
artificial.  The men and women are all a certain way of being.  I&#39;d like my<br/>
children to not feel the added pressure of what &quot;beauty standards&quot; are being<br/>
imposed in our society as it is.  Porn would just add to that struggle:<br/>
large boobs, small waists, large penises (maybe), and buffed bodies.  I&#39;d<br/>
like my children to formulate their own thoughts on sex and beauty as much<br/>
as possible without the aid of pornography.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now if they are interested in the human body and sex there are so many ways<br/>
to explore that without resorting to porn.  And, at the very least, I would<br/>
rather have them watching the adult films that are made by couples as an<br/>
aide to help other couples to have better sex.  Far better in my opinion<br/>
than random porn. <br/>

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and<br/>
affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is<br/>
more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present.&quot; <br/>
