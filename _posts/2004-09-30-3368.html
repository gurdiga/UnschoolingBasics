<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017154135">Colleen and all,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any help for you but have a similar concern.  I&#39;ve been trying<br/>
to figure out how to pose this question to this list for some time now.  My<br/>
13 yo is clever and kind and gentle and loving and principled and extremely<br/>
sensitive to other&#39;s criticisms, real or perceived.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t<br/>
stop trying to fix him until very recently and so he has 13+ years of built<br/>
up something, I don&#39;t know what to call it.  So often he is timid about<br/>
asserting his wishes, afraid to try new activities, afraid of being judged,<br/>
incredibly self-effacing, moody (which I suspect is partly due to his age)<br/>
and is struggling to find what his passions are.<br/>
<br/>
I was raised in a dysfunctional household where I learned to keep a low<br/>
profile and stay off my father&#39;s radar screen as much as possible.  Although<br/>
I don&#39;t have vivid memories, I know that every time I opened my mouth I was<br/>
setting myself up to be fixed -- grammar corrected, concept explained,<br/>
opinion belittled, etiquette corrected.  I know this because I recognize<br/>
these tendencies in myself as a parent and I can just feel it coming from<br/>
that &quot;innate&quot; what-I-learned-from-my-parents place inside of me. Over the<br/>
years I&#39;ve become more aware of these tendencies, identified them as they&#39;re<br/>
about to appear and suppressed or released them but not, I&#39;m afraid, before<br/>
causing damage to my dear son.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d gone along doing what I thought was unschooling for many years.  Last<br/>
year I was frustrated by the lack of self-direction he exhibited so I<br/>
decided to take back control.  I started giving him daily assignments while<br/>
at the same time imploring him to tell me what his interests were.  I<br/>
assured him that as soon as he found a topic of interest we would let that<br/>
lead his &quot;school work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then, in January he got sick.  For six weeks he went undiagnosed despite<br/>
five trips to the doctor&#39;s office.  His illness derailed, thank goodness,<br/>
all the structure that I&#39;d imposed.  He was ill for several months.  There<br/>
were aspects to his illness that were very disconcerting and confusing for<br/>
him and his father and I.  There was a strong psycho-somatic aspect to the<br/>
lingering symptoms but it was very difficult for any of us, especially my<br/>
son, to understand when his symptoms were psycho-somatic and when they were<br/>
genuinely caused by disease.  The symptoms were so severe that they<br/>
interfered with every aspect of his daily life. Although he was&#39;t in pain,<br/>
he was bedridden or homeridden most of 6 months. He became so confused, as<br/>
did I, and didn&#39;t trust himself to know up from down.  He quit playing his<br/>
musical instrument, something he&#39;d loved and had particpated in our school&#39;s<br/>
band, jazz band and received recognition for his talent.<br/>
<br/>
As you can tell, I&#39;m still processing all that happened last winter and<br/>
spring.  He didn&#39;t completely recover until June.  He&#39;s barely touched his<br/>
instrument again.  He does not wish to return to playing with the school<br/>
band, which I totally understand (being the only homeschooler amongst 70+<br/>
middle-school kids -- rough!) nor does he want to restart his private<br/>
lessons. He is a voracious reader -- mostly of the medeival fantasy and<br/>
historical fiction genres.  He is also very into RPG Video Games.<br/>
<br/>
But, for whatever myriad of reasons he seems to have a low self-esteem, is<br/>
anxious to the point of frequent tears around those who he perceives as<br/>
passing judgement on him (ie. grandparents who don&#39;t understand our<br/>
homeschooling/lifestyle/politics/lack of religion, clarinet teacher,<br/>
friends&#39; parents) and is not willing to take chances putting himself in<br/>
situations where he might experience this anxiety -- like any kinds of<br/>
classes, contests, competition or even hanging out with his cousins.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done a fine job of teaching him what is wrong with him and now I need a<br/>
way to undo as much of that as possible and show him what a beautiful,<br/>
bright, talented, compassionate, and interesting fellow he is.   Any ideas?<br/>

&gt; for those of you that attended the recent Live and Learn Conf,  I am referring<br/>
&gt; to Kelly Lovejoy&#39;s article in our attendee&#39;s binder entitled: &quot;The Three<br/>
&gt; Stages of Unschooling&quot; Stage 1. To reference my thoughts, here is part of<br/>
&gt; Kelly&#39;s writing:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Two of my passions as a child were dogs and horses. Dogs and horses are NOT<br/>
&gt; taught in any grade, Middle or HIgh School *!* know of. But I wanted to learn<br/>
&gt; everything I could about them. My parents gave me dogs and horses. They bought<br/>
&gt; me books and paid for me to take riding lessons and dog obedience classes,<br/>
&gt; They paid for dog and horse shows and equipment..........&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now Kelly, as a child, was &quot;bold&quot; (bold may not be the proper  nference here!)<br/>
&gt; enough to ask, mention or suggest to her parents , her interests. and they<br/>
&gt; responded. But what if you have a child ( maybe a really shy one in the<br/>
&gt; family)  who may not want to &quot;bother &quot; his parents with his needs (maybe<br/>
&gt; really feel not worthy to deserve them) or just afraid to ask, for feeling<br/>
&gt; that he may be rejected,,,,,, Some kids are truly gifted to be frugal and may<br/>
&gt; not see the need or feel the need to buy things for just themselves. They may<br/>
&gt; be thinking that spending the money on themselves is/would be a waste of<br/>
&gt; money. <br/>
&gt; How do you go about telling a child that it is OK to think about their<br/>
&gt; personal wants as not being selfish, self-centered or such.? And let the child<br/>
&gt; to gradually see that their wants are important too!<br/>

&gt; PS maybe Kelly was raised as an only child !!<br/>
