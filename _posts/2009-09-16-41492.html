helps.  Please ignore the link to the study that says enforcing bedtimes<br/>
makes kids healthier.  =P<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009571083">***&quot;We&#39;re talking about infants and toddlers, and I think that just, cognitively, they just don&#39;t understand enough about right or wrong or punishment to benefit from being spanked,&quot; said Lisa Berlin, the study&#39;s lead author and research scientist at the Center for Child and Family Policy at Duke University. ***<br/>
<br/>
What a strange sentence.  Who does benefit from being spanked?<br/>
<br/>
I know!  Hookers who get paid to let guys spank them! (I wonder how much you can charge for that?  That could be a new work from home scheme!))   Spanking is the special word we have for repeatedly slapping someone on the butt but if we could include other slapping then who benefits from being slapped?  In old movies, hysterical women got slapped.  It did seem to calm them down.    I wonder if it would benefit my husband to be slapped when he doesn&#39;t do what I want him to do.  What would those benefits be? (I wonder how long he&#39;d stand there and let me slap him?)  I wonder if my old mom would benefit from a slap or forty? (hold on!)  My boss waited on an annoying customer yesterday and I wonder if that customer would have benefited from some slapping.   (My boss might have felt some momentary satisfaction if she had slapped her!  Until the cops arrived.) <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a weird world when a mom worries video games or TV might hurt her kid but somehow believes being hit by the person a child loves and trusts the most has benefits. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m absolutely positive I would derive some fantastic benefit from slapping certain customers if there were no negative consequences in relation to losing my job! ;) <br/>
<br/>
Some people, no matter how tolerant and compassionate I try to be, are just plain F***ing crazy. I mean bad crazy, not cute crazy, or funny crazy...mean, scary, bad crazy and when you work retail. Well...you know. Smile and nod.<br/>

Your comments really cracked me up! It helps to see the absurdity.<br/>
Unfortunately, this was the norm in my home growing up. Part of my healing from that was realizing how absurd it would be for me to spank or slap another adult.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934644409">We got a wake-up call when DS was about 3. I&#39;d swatted him for something<br/>
(kicking when I was trying to get his shoes on him maybe...) He swatted<br/>
right back at me! That&#39;s when it dawned on us that hitting someone to<br/>
make them stop hitting you made ZERO sense! And it stopped right<br/>
there...it was hard to not react in the moment but DH and I sat down and<br/>
thought through when (what situations) we were most likely to end up<br/>
reacting in that way. Then we worked on how to change the situations.<br/>
For instance, I usually got into that &#39;mode&#39; when I was trying to get DS<br/>
ready to leave the house on a timeframe (going to an event that includes<br/>
others and starts at a specific time) BEFORE having had breakfast (I&#39;d<br/>
get him ready then we&#39;d sit down to breakfast). Duh! Just like on the<br/>
airplane when they explain about oxygen masks, if I get myself all ready<br/>
(showered, dressed, gear packed, food eaten) and THEN address getting DS<br/>
ready (although now that he&#39;s 11, not 3, he does a lot of it himself),<br/>
there&#39;s no &#39;bottleneck&#39; happening.<br/>
