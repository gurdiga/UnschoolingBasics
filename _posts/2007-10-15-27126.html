<div id="ygrps-yiv-111019813">I have started a blog on my Asperger/ Hyperlexic son&#39;s journey <br/>
towards deschooling/ unschooling via his PlayStation and his <br/>
obsession with the internet. One of my first deschooling/ unschooling <br/>
dilemma was his obsession with his PS2 and Lego Star Wars. But yet <br/>
one of the most daring decision I&#39;ve ever made in our very new <br/>
unschooling life was to allow my 7 yr old to play with the <br/>
controversial Grand Theft Auto. <br/>
<br/>
And now we have come out the other end, in one piece! My son is no <br/>
more violent than any 7 yrs old watching Scooby Doo. And <br/>
interestingly he&#39;s switched from ultra violent Grand Theft Auto to <br/>
softy-cutie Disney Toon Town online community game! And somehow, all <br/>
these PS2 playing and online gaming is culminating into his <br/>
understanding of numbers and maths. Infact, his obsession with the <br/>
PS2 and the internet is supporting his learning in many ways.  <br/>
<br/>
After much consideration, I&#39;m thinking perhaps my experience might <br/>
offer some comfort or ideas to some unschooling parent with video <br/>
game issues. Hence I&#39;m offering the link to my blog, with good faith <br/>
and good intention. I am not promoting or preaching any unschooling <br/>
methods. These blogs is purely a log of my thoughts on our <br/>
unschooling progress, for my own benefit, as some of the contents is <br/>
obviously not very unschooling, please bear in mind that <br/>
my &quot;schooled&quot; brain is stll in the process of de-schooling. So I <br/>
would appreciate it if anyone do read my blog, to only leave positive <br/>
or helpful response or nothing at all. If you do have any <br/>
disagreement with my method of parenting/ unschooling, pls do keep it <br/>
to yourself. <br/>
