<div id="ygrps-yiv-110760227">We actually had a similar problem here.  After pulling my son out of ps, we realized our &quot;A&quot; student was actually almost 2 grades behind in math.

Ok Ive got one for you. After lots of reading and floundering, I tend<br/>
towards unschooling. But I have always believed in going slowly. When<br/>
they seem discouraged (math) I back off for a while. So, of course we<br/>
are behind in Math. Well, some kids laughed at my son because he was<br/>
&quot;just learning fractions&quot;, and he was embarrassed. So, he comes to me<br/>
and tells me that it is all my fault because I didn&#39;t teach him in step<br/>
with what the other ps kids know.<br/>
<br/>
This is the kid who fights me constantly on learning math, nearly<br/>
refuses to do it daily, and then complains its my fault he doesn&#39;t know<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
What to do?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877333076">Dannette - I think I get it now.  You&#39;re worried that Sara is having too much control over Maddy?  So you need to figure out how to support Maddy when she doesn&#39;t feel like playing what (or how) the way Sara wants to play?   <br/>
<br/>
And it sounds like Maddy has worked out a way to have some control over the situation--she goes off by herself.  Now if Sara could just figure out how to include more of Maddy&#39;s ideas in their play... then she wouldn&#39;t lose her playmate.   <br/>

<br/>
My kids are very close in age and when they were quite small, the younger<br/>
one did everything the older one told her to.  As they grew a little older,<br/>
they younger one began to assert herself and not just follow along.  When<br/>
that happened there was definitely some upheaval in the house.  I just<br/>
talked to the older one repeatedly about taking turns and sharing and I<br/>
helped them to negotiate what they wanted with each other.  Eventually they<br/>
learned how to negotiate what they wanted themselves.  Just be there to help<br/>
them sort through things and help them to explain themselves to each other<br/>
and they will learn to do it on their own in time.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, make sure that if one of them wants time alone that you support<br/>
that and help the other one to understand it.  &lt;everyone is different&gt; That<br/>
is also what my younger one did when she felt too bossed around.  She still<br/>
enjoys playing alone sometimes, while my older dd prefers the company of<br/>
others for play.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177582206">Hi Diedre, <br/>
    Yes that is it. Also when trying to explain unschooling to DH ,who<br/>
is very supprtive of homeschooling-, he was very uneasy about it. He<br/>
is not a reader himself so I can&#39;t give him something to read on it<br/>
unless it is very short. Any suggestions?<br/>

     I really do love the goals and philosophy of unschooling. It will<br/>
just be hard for all of us to really let go of &quot;schooling &quot; and just<br/>
trust! This group will help, at least me !<br/>
