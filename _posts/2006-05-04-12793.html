<div id="ygrps-yiv-940128529">I got this  on another list today, it is really fun to watch!  Oh, and the <br/>
kids like  it, too!  :) <br/>

Background  on Honda commercial: <br/>
“And you thought  those people who set up rooms full of dominos to knock over <br/>
were amazing...There  are no computer graphics or digital tricks in the film. <br/>
Everything you see  really happened in real time exactly as you see it. <br/>
The film took 606  takes. On the first 605 takes, something, usually minor, <br/>
didn&#39;t work. They would  then have to set the whole thing up again. The crew <br/>
spent weeks shooting night  and day. By the time it was over, they were ready to <br/>
change professions. The  film cost six million dollars and took three months <br/>
to complete including full  engineering of the sequence. In addition, it&#39;s two <br/>
minutes long so every time  Honda airs the film on British television, <br/>
they&#39;re shelling out enough dough to  keep any one of us in clover for a lifetime. <br/>
However, it is fast  becoming the most downloaded  advertisement in Internet <br/>
history. Honda  executives figure the ad will soon pay for itself simply in <br/>
&quot;free viewings&quot;  (Honda isn&#39;t paying a dime to have you watch this commercial!). <br/>
When the ad was  pitched to senior executives, they signed off on it <br/>
immediately without any  hesitation - including the costs. <br/>
There are six and  only six hand-made Honda Accords in the world. To the <br/>
horror of Honda engineers,  the filmmakers disassembled two of them to make the <br/>
film. Everything you see in  the film (aside from the walls, floor, ramp, and  <br/>
complete Honda Accord) is  parts from those two cars. The voiceover is Garrison <br/>
Keillor. When the ad was  shown to Honda executives, they liked it and <br/>
commented on how amazing computer  graphics have gotten.  They fell off their chairs <br/>
when they found out it  was for real.  Oh. and about those funky windshield <br/>
wipers.  On  the new Accords, the windshield wipers have water sensors and are <br/>
designed  to start doing their thing automatically as soon as they become  <br/>
wet. It  looks a bit weird in the commercial.” <br/>
