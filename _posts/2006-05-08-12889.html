<br/>
LOL  We&#39;re in Zone 1 (Fairbanks), but it does get surprisingly warm in the summer...  80&#39;s and a few 90 degree days.  That said, the humidity is very low, and the evenings may still be a bit cool for the flytraps (50&#39;s and 60&#39;s?).<br/>

  In Alaska, you can grow some northern pitcher plants outside.  I&#39;m not <br/>
  sure what zone you&#39;re in, but you may need to keep your flytraps <br/>
  inside.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428871897">Hi all<br/>
  I hope you all wont mind me who neither has children nor is engaged in teaching being part of this group.I have been learning from children for about 10 years now.<br/>
  I live in a small village ,Aruvacode, in Kerala,India.<br/>
  I work with a potters community trying to revive the tradition of pottery making as a livelyhood.<br/>
  Do see my site www.kumbham.in to see our pottery work.<br/>
  I have been observivg and learning from children as I felt that inorder to understand the natural process of learning one must observe children in their natural settings.The people with whom I live   has not gone to school.Or in other words are not yet schooled in to the modern ways,but follow their innate knowledge and intuition and instincts.Children are left free to be and to make sense of the world on their own.No one is engaged in bringing them up.<br/>
  These observations has chellenged many of my schooled notions about children,knowledge,learning process etc.<br/>
  I am interested in sharing and exploring these with others who are interested in children.<br/>
