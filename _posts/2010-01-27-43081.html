<div id="ygrps-yiv-278315585">My boys are totally into using the computer all day long and i am ok with that but at the end of the day the boys all go NUTS!! they run around and scream and jump on each other and can&#39;t control themselves to the point where they are all getting hurt and angry with eachother.  they need to get some activity during the day but i don&#39;t want to tell them they have to turn off the computer and jump for a while.  i suggest they take a break and play.  i pull out games that involve physical activity that they love and they say &quot;YEA! let&#39;s play LATER!&quot;  i know a lot of this is because it&#39;s winter in northern ohio and it will get better in the spring but what to do until then?  any suggestions? <br/>

I&#39;m curious what you mean by &quot;end of the day&quot;? Is there a time they all tend to get sick of the computer at once? If so, maybe you can plan some high-energy fun to happen around that time - actively look for something they can do to work off some of that pent up energy.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, look for ways for them to get some action while playing - either encourage them to do something physical while something is loading (and by encourage I mean offer to do something fun *with* them, right that second) and/or look for things they can do while also playing: jump on a mini-trampoline, sit on an exercise ball, that sort of thing. <br/>
<br/>
Since part of the trouble is being stuck inside, look for big-body toys to bring into the house - you might need to rotate them if, like me, you don&#39;t have much space! But you could have a sit-n-spin availabale, a big ball with a handle for bouncing (or an exercise ball), balloons, a small slide, a chin-up bar, a rope swing, a skateboard (sit on it and scoot around the floor), a punching bag, a tunnel, I even had a small slide at one point! Like I said, you might have to have just one or two things available and rotate as they get stale. <br/>

That always amazed/amazes me - that DS can jump on a mini trampoline<br/>
while playing videogames and manage to run, jump, shoot, whatever at the<br/>
same time he&#39;s bouncing (Thank heaven for wireless controllers!) I can<br/>
barely keep my character from repeatedly hitting walls and getting<br/>
killed while sitting still!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Spring&#39;s coming. It won&#39;t be like that forever ;-) And once video  <br/>
games are beaten or played with several different options, the  <br/>
challenges offer diminishing returns.<br/>
<br/>
How about a trampoline in front of the TV? Wii&#39;s have lots of active  <br/>
games. Impromptu games of tag?<br/>
<br/>
Think of video games as a page turner with *a lot* of pages ;-)  <br/>
Haven&#39;t you ever said to yourself as you&#39;re engrossed in a book, &quot;One  <br/>
more page and I&#39;ll turn off the light&quot; and then it&#39;s 20 or 30  pages  <br/>
or even the end of the book and dawn&#39;s breaking ;-) A well designed  <br/>
video game is exactly like that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d keep offering. I&#39;d offer different things. If they respond well  <br/>
to you planning a day out like going to an indoor play space, let  <br/>
them know ahead of time and build it up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is probably right, but it&#39;s frustrating and makes for unhappy  <br/>
moms to seize a solution and then turn the new problem into how to  <br/>
get the kids to comply with the solution.<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried asking them about it when they&#39;re not in the midst of  <br/>
play or release of energy? Like when you&#39;re all in the car together.  <br/>
Ask them about being energetic with each other and what *they* think  <br/>
about it. And what solutions they might come up with. Listen without  <br/>
interjecting much. Helping them play around with ideas and problem  <br/>
solve is a much more useful life skill than getting them to release  <br/>
energy for a single day&#39;s more peaceful evening.<br/>
