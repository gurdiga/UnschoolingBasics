case, I figured I&#39;d forward today&#39;s post to the group.<br/>

It&#39;s free to subscribe---and you don&#39;t even have to do the experiments. <br/>
But he sends fun things to do on a regular basis. We&#39;ve had fun with a <br/>
lot of the experiements over the years.<br/>

           Robert Krampf&#39;s Experiment of the Week<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

 This Week&#39;s Experiment - #475 Burning Calories<br/>
<br/>
  Greetings from Jensen Beach, Florida. I am still doing science shows <br/>
in the<br/>
  area, and having a blast, with shows, nature photography, walks on the <br/>
beach,<br/>
 and visiting with friends.<br/>
<br/>
 This week&#39;s experiment comes from a teacher inservice on energy that I<br/>
  presented at Florida Power and Light&#39;s Energy Encounter last week. We <br/>
were talking<br/>
  about different ways that we measure energy, and as we talked about <br/>
the<br/>
  energy stored in our food, they got quite a surprise. To see what <br/>
startled them,<br/>
 you will need:<br/>
<br/>
  1 M&M candy, or a small candy that tells you how many calories it <br/>
contains<br/>
<br/>
  In our food conscious world, we hear a lot about calories, but most <br/>
people<br/>
  don&#39;t really know what a calorie is. Calories are a measure of energy. <br/>
One<br/>
  calorie is the heat energy that it takes to raise the temperature of <br/>
one gram<br/>
 of water by one degree Celsius.<br/>
<br/>
 There is some confusion, since in the food industry; the word Calorie<br/>
  actually refers to a kilocalorie, which is one thousand actual <br/>
calories. The<br/>
  nutritional Calorie is spelled with a capital &quot;C&quot;, while the actual <br/>
calorie has a<br/>
 lower case &quot;c&quot;. One nutritional Calorie has enough energy to raise the<br/>
  temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. That means <br/>
that a piece<br/>
  of candy that contains 200 nutritional Calories has enough chemical <br/>
energy<br/>
  stored in it to raise the temperature of 200 kilograms (200 liters) of <br/>
water by<br/>
 one degree.<br/>
<br/>
  When you eat food, your body has two choices. It can use the Calories, <br/>
or<br/>
  it can store them for later. To maintain a steady body weight, we need <br/>
to use<br/>
  as many Calories as we consume. Depending on what you eat, and how <br/>
much you<br/>
  exercise that can be a challenge. To give you an idea of what it takes <br/>
to<br/>
 use up the Calories, lets try an example.<br/>
<br/>
 Pick up one M&M candy. Look at it carefully. Not very big, is it? And<br/>
  it only contains 4.3 nutritional Calories. Not much at all, right? <br/>
Now, eat<br/>
 the candy. So far, this is a really fun experiment.<br/>
<br/>
  Now, lets burn up the Calories from that tiny piece of candy. To do <br/>
that,<br/>
  you have walk at a brisk pace for 100 yards, the length of a football <br/>
field.<br/>
  No, just sitting there thinking about walking will not have the same <br/>
result.<br/>
  Get up and actually walk. After walking that distance, you will have <br/>
burned<br/>
 about the same amount of energy that was in the candy.<br/>
<br/>
  Now, think about eating an entire bag of M&Ms. For each 18 pieces of <br/>
candy<br/>
  that you eat, you would have to walk just over a mile, so even a small <br/>
bag of<br/>
 candy would mean several miles of walking.<br/>
<br/>
  Look at some other foods, to see how far you would have to walk. You <br/>
will<br/>
  be amazed at how much energy you consume. But wait a minute! If you <br/>
look at<br/>
  guides to nutrition, most recommend a diet of about 10 Calories for <br/>
each<br/>
  pound of your weight each day. If you weigh 150 pounds, then a healthy <br/>
diet<br/>
  should include about 1500 Calories. To walk that off, you would have <br/>
to walk<br/>
 almost 20 miles a day! What is going on?<br/>
<br/>
  Well, not all the Calories you eat are used for exercise. Much that <br/>
energy<br/>
  goes towards producing heat, to keep your body at a constant 98.6 <br/>
degrees.<br/>
  It varies from person to person, but about 800 to 1000 of the calories <br/>
that the<br/>
  average person eats will go towards producing the heat that maintains <br/>
your<br/>
  body temperature. The rest of the Calories go towards keeping your <br/>
body<br/>
 running and letting you do the things that you do every day.<br/>
<br/>
  If you eat more calories, then you need to exercise more, to keep your <br/>
body<br/>
  from storing that energy as fat. That&#39;s why I spend so much time <br/>
hiking with<br/>
  30 pounds of camera equipment on my back. Besides the fun I have with <br/>
nature<br/>
  photography, it also helps me burn off all the ice cream, chocolate <br/>
sauce,<br/>
 whipped cream, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 Have a wonder filled week!<br/>
