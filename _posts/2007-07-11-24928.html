<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714289172">Hi All-<br/>
<br/>
I have joined the group recently, so will start with a quick intro. I am <br/>
Heather, we live in NY state, we have two children, a son 14, and a <br/>
daughter, 10. They have have been unschooled for a long time, but in the <br/>
last couple of years we have been moving deeper into it. I work at home, <br/>
and have interest in discussing unschooling in relation to that.<br/>
<br/>
My immediate concern is my son&#39;s speech disflucencies. He has had a <br/>
relatively mild stutter for a long time - he had been going to speech <br/>
therapy at our local college for a couple years and he seems to have <br/>
benefited from that. He was willing to do this as he does want to be <br/>
able to speak clearly - he wants to be able to participate verbally.<br/>
<br/>
Recently he went to my mom&#39;s for a week, which he has done every summer <br/>
since he turned 9- he really looks forward to this. When he returned <br/>
this time, we noticed that his disfluency was very extreme - more <br/>
extreme than ever before. He has severe difficulty getting some words <br/>
out- sometimes many - even his own name. He gives up trying to say that <br/>
word and even trying to speak at all. Needless to say, he is very <br/>
frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
He also has recently started his first job and a new class in sound <br/>
tech, and has been very very busy. Though he did have a few days off <br/>
just now and this hasn&#39;t really helped. I talked to him about what might <br/>
have triggered this, he said it started after a large party my mom had- <br/>
about 50 people - he played his bass at this party and I imagine was <br/>
getting a bit of attention - though it didn&#39;t seem to him that it was <br/>
extremely traumatic.<br/>
<br/>
He is feeling very worried about not being able to talk at his class, <br/>
and at work.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody have any experience with anything like this? I will try to <br/>
contact a therapist and do some research- but time and time again it is <br/>
unschoolers who have the most helpful input in any situation so I am <br/>
posting here first.<br/>
<br/>
thanks so much!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-392768542">Hi Heather,<br/>
<br/>
This may not be what you&#39;re looking for but I&#39;ll share what has  <br/>
helped us.  It was pure serendipity.  I met someone in the airport  <br/>
who told me about a woman who helped them w/ their colicky baby.  She  <br/>
does Quantum Energetics and flower remedies (very esoteric ones).  We  <br/>
worked over the phone.  Our DS was having strong facial tics all of a  <br/>
sudden.  She  made up a bottle of remedies and I sprayed him (they  <br/>
smell divine).  And that was it.  they stopped immediately.  She  <br/>
works intuitively and I think is quite amazing.  The flower remedies  <br/>
she makes up are for the whole family so we all take them.  Her  <br/>
website is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jennyqe.com/">http://www.jennyqe.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Maybe it might help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39162305">Heather gave me permission to repost this to the group.  We&#39;ve been <br/>
friends for many years and she had emailed me privately about this <br/>
earlier in the week.  It wasn&#39;t until after i sent her my response <br/>
that i saw her posting on UB.  I thought perhaps my personal reply to <br/>
her would be of interest to others on this list as well as wanting to <br/>
hear what others might have to say on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
***** My reply....<br/>
Older dd&#39;s enunciation was difficult to understand when she was <br/>
younger (in fact younger dd was the same way).  But it was never a <br/>
major issue because she was<br/>
always with me and so I was there to interpret.   (Younger dd on the <br/>
other hand<br/>
was harder to understand and best friend sometimes interpreted even <br/>
for me.  It would frustrate younger dd that I would ask her to repeat <br/>
or slow down what she said so I could understand her.  I had to make <br/>
sure I was looking directly head on in order to capture what she <br/>
said.)  I had noticed that when older dd spoke to my mom on the phone <br/>
she slowed down and spoke more clearly.  It reflected how dependant <br/>
we are on visual cues when communicating because in their absence <br/>
(the telephone) it did require her to compensate.  Also - my personal <br/>
theory was that had she been in daycare, preschool or kindergarten <br/>
the development of her enunciation would have been different.  She <br/>
wasn&#39;t required to focus attention on it and so it developed at her <br/>
own pace.<br/>
Older dd still has difficulty with word spaghetti and hospital.  <br/>
Double constanants being more difficult language developmentally.  I <br/>
never took her to &#39;professional&#39; speech person even though my mother <br/>
and brother brought it up as something I should consider.  And <br/>
younger dd still has a slight lisp that I can detect but no one has <br/>
ever commented and I will not.<br/>
<br/>
Older dd has no speech &#39;disfluency&quot; at this time in her life.  What a <br/>
fancy word for one who can&#39;t get the words out as quickly as their <br/>
mind is thinking.  (That is what the pediatrician said about her <br/>
speaking style when she was 5 and dh insisted we consult <br/>
a &#39;professional.&#39;...she justs thinks faster than she can talk).  That <br/>
was the extent of our investigations and we did it discretely so that <br/>
she was unaware the doc was listening with intent.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t notice anything at all with your ds when we were with you <br/>
last month.<br/>
<br/>
So apparently the speech therapy did *not* help if there is no real <br/>
change in a new situation, perhaps it&#39;s not the speech but the new <br/>
situation that causes an amount of anxiety.  Does this tend to pass <br/>
once he is comfortable in a new environment?  <br/>
<br/>
Without knowing more...my first instincts would be to not focus on <br/>
removing the stuttering per se but to help him to be comfortable with <br/>
himself when he finds he is not clearly able to communicate.  To <br/>
reinforce his success in overcoming his &#39;disfluency&#39; (now that it&#39;s <br/>
been labeled) once he is acclimated to a new environment.  I&#39;d focus <br/>
on giving him tools to build his confidence, reminder him that it <br/>
does eventually pass once a situation is no longer new.  Or that it <br/>
doesn&#39;t always exist at all in every situation.  Is it certain people <br/>
or situations that tend to bring up the stutter?  Is it speaking in <br/>
front of a group?  Or just when he&#39;s excited about something?<br/>
These would be questions I might ask him *if he wants to discuss <br/>
it*...or is this something you are concerned about and he is not.  <br/>
Has he expressed this as limiting or are you?  Can you simply be an <br/>
empathetic listener when he expresses frustration and then remind him <br/>
that he is a wonderful communicator once he is comfortable in a <br/>
situation and that you have full confidence that this will work its <br/>
way out once Ithaca is no longer new (assuming it is).  <br/>
<br/>
I think ultimately labels do more harm than good in this type of <br/>
situation.<br/>
And having attention drawn to his communication style as being a <br/>
problem by adults around him may have only created and then <br/>
reinforced his own insecurity.<br/>
<br/>
Point out that he communicates beautifully and that you have complete <br/>
confidence in him may do more for this resolving itself with time, <br/>
maturity and experience than any &#39;therapist&#39; could ever.  <br/>
<br/>
Otoh, it may never resolve itself in which case your job is to a. <br/>
truly accept him as the beautiful person he is regardless of his <br/>
proficiency in this skill and b. help maintain (or in this case <br/>
rebuild) his confidence that he is perfect just the way he is...he <br/>
has so many wonderful gifts that this is only a small part of who he <br/>
is overall and doesn&#39;t or doesn&#39;t have to (a choice) define or limit <br/>
him in anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is helpful.<br/>
Lisa.<br/>

<br/>
Hi Lisa-<br/>
<br/>
I am searching archives for stuttering on RUL and came across an old <br/>
post of yours on the subject- ds is having really intense bout of <br/>
stuttering that is really limiting him. He has been in speech therapy <br/>
the last 2-3 years(mainly due to dh being concerned, though he did <br/>
agree to go as he felt it was helping), which seems to have helped in <br/>
the past, but now he is not as is it summer and he does it at Ithaca <br/>
College. <br/>
<br/>
How have things gone with dd&#39;s speech disfluency- has it just <br/>
resolved itself over time?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not sure since this has really not happened like this- so dramatic <br/>
a change in a short period of time. though he does seem to be less <br/>
worried now than a few days ago, and his speech seems to come a little <br/>
bit easier. He is willing to go into situations, and is not avoiding speech.<br/>
<br/>
I did speak to the supervising professor at the college where he has <br/>
attended speech therapy and he said that since my son hadn&#39;t been <br/>
experiencing the same type of disfluency/speech blockages in the past <br/>
that he is now, they hadn&#39;t been focusing on recovery strategies as much <br/>
as general clearness of speech and confidence, and that he thought that <br/>
he could use some more specific strategies to deal with this situation. <br/>
I like him and the general theory and attitude of this clinic. They are <br/>
very respectful of kids, and also deal with anxiety and thoughts <br/>
underlying the speech issues, as well as strategies and control.<br/>
<br/>
When we sought therapy for him the second time a few years ago(age 11?), <br/>
his speech was difficult to understand- unclear and low in volume- <br/>
attempting to cover up the stutter. He had been in speech therapy in our <br/>
former school district for a couple of years, but that seemed to be of <br/>
poor quality and there were 2-3 years in between that he had no speech <br/>
therapy.The reason we did seek therapy to begin with was due to my <br/>
husband&#39;s concern. I agreed because I was starting to feel like I was <br/>
being neglectful as the conventional wisdom on this says you must seek <br/>
therapy at a young age. My husband agreed with this, and I reluctantly <br/>
agreed to take him, as I couldn&#39;t really back up my point of view- which <br/>
was to just wait and see and not focus on it and let him build <br/>
confidence in general. We were not allowing our son at that time to make <br/>
decisions as much as he does now. Now I  discuss with him whether he <br/>
will go back each session, and he says that although he doesn&#39;t enjoy <br/>
going, it has been of benefit and he decides to go back.  It is too late <br/>
to go back to it not being a thing, or to remove the label. In the past <br/>
couple of years his speech has really not been an issue, and he has <br/>
become really great at communicating with all kinds of people and going <br/>
into new situations and being comfortable. Maybe due to speech therapy, <br/>
or maybe it would have happened anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am wondering if even taking him at all was a mistake. I have just <br/>
realized that I have been looking at this as more of a<br/>
medical issue, rather than a what might be described as a learning <br/>
issue, or not as an issue at all. When I hear of someone seeking help <br/>
for a child who is reading or writing, later than usual or doesn&#39;t sit <br/>
still, and therefore having a label placed on that child and calling it <br/>
a medical problem, I don&#39;t think of it as being similar to what we did <br/>
with our son and his speech. Now I see it. I think when you are the <br/>
parent of a child who is has some &quot;problem&quot; like this, it can become <br/>
difficult to trust yourself and to feel that you must &quot;DO SOMETHING&quot; and <br/>
quickly, before it is too late- due to opinions of others around you and <br/>
wanting to be a &quot;good&quot; parent. Especially when the other person is also <br/>
a parent of your child! I often take the strategy of doing nothing until <br/>
my husband gets pretty uncomfortable with doing nothing and forces the <br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;Has he expressed this as limiting or are you? Can you simply be an<br/>
 </span></blockquote>empathetic listener when he expresses frustration and then remind him<br/>
that he is a wonderful communicator once he is comfortable in a<br/>
situation and that you have full confidence that this will work its<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;way out once Ithaca is no longer new (assuming it is).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He did bring it up - one night after he attended a session of the  radio <br/>
broadcast/sound tech course he is taking- it was the first night they <br/>
met at the radio station. He was unable to say his name when he went in, <br/>
and unable to take his turn speaking on the radio with the other kids. <br/>
He expressed frustration at not being able to say what he wanted to say- <br/>
and thought maybe he shouldn&#39;t go back. We haven&#39;t talked much more <br/>
about it, but he is scheduled to go back tomorrow night.<br/>
<br/>
I did remind him that he is very capable of clear understandable speech, <br/>
and that he can get back there again. I also told him that  therapy <br/>
sessions are available if he feels like he needs them. We are waiting <br/>
and seeing right now. I feel a little confused about the value of the <br/>
therapy, and how to see it.<br/>
<br/>
I am not someone who seeks help with health or other problems outside of <br/>
myself very often- mostly due to skepticism and partly<br/>
due to finances. My husband is much quicker to say- let&#39;s take them to <br/>
the doctor, or whoever, when something seems to be wrong.  I usually <br/>
trust that things will resolve themselves and trust my own judgment in <br/>
the situation, not an expert&#39;s. Most of the time we see a doctor, I <br/>
wonder why we went and leave the prescription in my wallet, and go home <br/>
and do what I thought was right anyway. However, my husband does not <br/>
always trust my judgment. Sometimes I get a little weary and give in. <br/>
And not really having any information on this particular issue besides <br/>
the conventional, I doubt myself. There are plenty of examples of <br/>
children learning to read or write or sit still in time with no <br/>
intervention. Less so with speech- and the warnings to seek therapy <br/>
early are pretty universal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828091102">Dear Heather,<br/>
I just wanted to put in my experiences with therapies, I don&#39;t know how helpful it will be <br/>
but the snip that I quoted below reminded me of my Sam. He has dysarthria, mostly his <br/>
speech was affected, and at the age of two and a half, we did seek out therapy because he <br/>
was so angry all the time, because we couldn&#39;t understand. Not for lack of trying, but we <br/>
honestly did not know how to help him and honestly could not understand where he was <br/>
going with stuff. He knew and used some sign language, but he wanted to talk and he <br/>
wanted us to understand. If we did not understand immediately, people were likely to be <br/>
hurt. So we went to a good therapist (in that she was very respectful and child-oriented, <br/>
she actually worked with us with our other kids too)  and once she figured out where the <br/>
problem was, he made really rapid progress. After about twelve months, he was finished. <br/>
<br/>
Except that once ST stopped, he started to regress a bit. But it was okay at that point <br/>
because emotionally he was able to deal with us not understanding, and able to try <br/>
alternative language options. Today he still has some motor problems, bites himself a lot <br/>
talking and eating, but he&#39;s okay with it, and better yet, we all understand how to help him <br/>
in a natural, loving environment that he&#39;s okay with. If he gets to a point where he&#39;s <br/>
frustrated again, we&#39;d address the possibility of therapy again, and use it as needed. But <br/>
for now we can do our own stuff (lots of sensory diet, stimulating the mouth, slowing <br/>
down and concentrating once or twice a day helps the rest of the day, etc)<br/>
<br/>
Early therapy does help most kids, but it&#39;s not the end-all, be-all that people imagine. In <br/>
fact, we&#39;ve been vilified because our autistic daughter isn&#39;t in all kinds of therapy, forty <br/>
hours a week. The funny thing is that she&#39;s still developing, and she&#39;s much happier than <br/>
she was before unschooling, untherapy, unEVERYthing. :-) I think unschooling as been the <br/>
best for all of our kids because it accepts their differences and we can live our life fulfilling <br/>
needs without guilt or worry or shame. I think that &#39;intervention&#39; is a loaded word, because <br/>
life intervenes. Kids learn to read because words intervene, writing happens because kids <br/>
need to write...and speech happens because kids have to talk. If they need tools, then we <br/>
find the tools. For us, it happened to be a speech therapist. Then it wasn&#39;t. It might be <br/>
again, but there&#39;s no guarantees. I think what you&#39;ve described for your son has been <br/>
wonderful, and I&#39;m sorry that he&#39;s worried about his radio class. I hope he can find some <br/>
peace there,<br/>
