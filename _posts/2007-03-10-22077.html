<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114020114">Dh and I are in the process of updating our wills.  Dh&#39;s sis and her <br/>
hubby are the guardians of our children in case anything should <br/>
happen to us.  We know for sure they would not homeschool the kids, <br/>
but that was not our major criteria for picking a guardian. I am not <br/>
sure if I were a single mom (by choice or dh&#39;s demise) either I would <br/>
manage to homeschool.  I am an RN (here in Canada, so basically no <br/>
flexability in schedules like working just weekends or anything) and <br/>
it&#39;s definitely not a work from home career or anything, so at this <br/>
time if something happened I just cannot see any way I could manage <br/>
to keep the kids home and unschool either.  We have limited <br/>
babysitting (I have a half time job, dh has no guarenteed hours in <br/>
his right now but works around me as much as possible) and only need <br/>
4-5 days a month tops, but I know they are not willing to do more.<br/>
<br/>
I unschool because of the way my children and very definitely the way <br/>
my dd learns...very kinesthetic/language oriented, cannot sit still, <br/>
etc.  She very much fits the profile of a highly sensitive kid, I am <br/>
sure she would suffer in school.  I just see her blossoming so much <br/>
at home, and how she learns best at her own terms.  I know this is <br/>
the right way for us to learn, just through life.  However, doing my <br/>
will has brought up a number of thoughts....I know my kids are WHO <br/>
THEY ARE, they can only be compared to themselves, etc.  I just have <br/>
this niggling thought in the back of my mind that both of them would <br/>
be majorly &quot;behind&quot; if ever put in a school setting (well, ds is not <br/>
school age, but definitely has motor/speech issues that I am debating <br/>
getting evaluated because of more and more problems they are causing <br/>
in everyday situations) <br/>
<br/>
They are enjoying their real lives RIGHT NOW, growing everyday, which <br/>
is what is important.  I would not change my unschooling to school at <br/>
home just because of a remote possibility that something would happen <br/>
to one or both of us, but I have been somewhat haunted by thoughts of <br/>
my kids struggling in school especially when I think of where dd is <br/>
related to a typical scope and sequence...sort of &quot;proof&quot; to my <br/>
family/SIL that unschooling doesn;t work. <br/>
<br/>
As dh says, I/we wouldn&#39;t be around after our deaths to worry about <br/>
it now wouldn&#39;t we?<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts from anyone on all this?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708703295">Very briefly, I think having their needs best met now will best prepare them for whatever may come in the future.  For example, if your dd were in school now and not having a great experience, she really wouldn&#39;t be better prepared to handle the trauma of your deaths, a new family, and moving to a new school, than she will be by your doing now what you think is best for her in the present.  A child who has been filled to the brim with the best experiences possible will be better prepared for whatever comes than a child who&#39;s already needy and struggling.<br/>
<br/>
Same concept as putting your child in daycare so they&#39;ll be prepared for preschool so they&#39;ll be prepared for kindergarten -- doesn&#39;t really work that way, though it&#39;s not an uncommon logic.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that makes sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657342274">Get good life insurance policy and stipulate which monies to apply to <br/>
maintaining educational status as homeschoolers.  And/or perhaps there is <br/>
good alternative school in area of sil & bil that you might feel comfortable <br/>
should they need to go somewhere. Also - don&#39;t know about where  you live <br/>
but in NY there is difference between physical custody and educational <br/>
custody.  That might be something to consider as far as who &#39;educates&#39; your <br/>
children.<br/>

Our wills state who will take our boys. Cameron is now 19, so we did a <br/>
new one right after his 18th birthday so that *he* would be the legal <br/>
guardian of Duncan (11). Up until then, we&#39;d picked out friends who <br/>
understand unschooling. She was Cameron&#39;s third grade teacher and is <br/>
now the head of a schoool for kids with learning differences. When we <br/>
decided to pull Cam out of school, she&#39;s the one who suggested I read <br/>
Holt. &lt;g&gt; Her husband is a sociology professor at the university. Our <br/>
life insurance $$ would&#39;ve covered one&#39;s salary so that one could stay <br/>
home with the boys and continue to unschool. Period. All understood and <br/>
in writing.<br/>
<br/>
We couldn&#39;t have left them with family---the boys would&#39;ve been back in <br/>
school before you could say John Holt. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It certainly gets easier as they get older. I know *I* breathe more <br/>
easily!<br/>
<br/>
I guess it depends on what&#39;s more important to you. Unschooling and <br/>
mindful parenting were more important to me and Ben than the idea that <br/>
they would be with family. Still so. If Ben and Cam and I all die, Dunc <br/>
still goes to Pat & Gillian.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve offered before and have been taken up on the offer once so far: <br/>
Ben and I are happy to be the guardians of any unschooled child. We all <br/>
doubt it will ever happen, but the peace of mind of knowing that the <br/>
lifestyle would be maintained is immeasurable. You would have to put it <br/>
in your wills though---and I think it would be a good idea to know us. <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt; Come visit. &lt;g&gt; But we&#39;re as serious as we can be.<br/>
