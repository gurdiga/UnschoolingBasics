You can find homeopathics at any health food store, or online.  There are<br/>
many brands.  I&#39;ve used Hyland&#39;s and Boericke and Tafel brands with great<br/>
success!  And each of those brands have a remedy called &#39;Sore Throat&#39;, which<br/>
is basically a combination of remedies tailored to that symptom.  If I take<br/>
the remedy at THE FIRST SIGN of the funk, I beat it every time.  Now, I keep<br/>
it on hand always.  And it&#39;s inexpensive, another bonus! :)<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear her throat is better!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

&quot;ViraStop.&quot; I talked to a lot of people who use it and<br/>
are very happy with it. <br/>
