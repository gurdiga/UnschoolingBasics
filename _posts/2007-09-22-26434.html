platform ever since. NHEN (National Home Education Network) wrote to  <br/>
the NEA and got this response:<br/>
<br/>
February 26, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Dear Ms. Hardenbergh:<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your recent comments about my speech at the National  <br/>
Press Club. I also appreciate the information on homeschooling and  <br/>
the National Home Education Network.<br/>
<br/>
The Association is very concerned about the education and well-being  <br/>
of all children, and works to ensure that they are taught in an  <br/>
environment conducive to effective learning. The NEA Representative  <br/>
Assembly, made up of 9,000 delegates who represent the 2.6 million  <br/>
members throughout the country, is the Association&#39;s primary policy- <br/>
making body. This body thoroughly discusses and debates every  <br/>
proposed policy before voting to approve or reject it.<br/>
<br/>
During the 1998 RA, delegates approved the policy on homeschooling.  <br/>
They were concerned that homeschooled students were not provided a  <br/>
comprehensive education experience because they did not have an  <br/>
opportunity to interact with students of different cultures, economic  <br/>
status, or learning styles. They felt homeschooled students learned  <br/>
in a setting primarily made up [of] family members and friends.<br/>
<br/>
We know that parental involvement is imperative for school  <br/>
achievement, but delegates were concerned that home schools were not  <br/>
required to use state-approved curricula. They agreed that  <br/>
homeschooled students have done well on national tests and were the  <br/>
top spellers in the National Spelling Bee two years ago, but felt  <br/>
home school instruction should meet certain state education standards.<br/>
<br/>
These are some of the reasons delegates approved the 1998 resolution  <br/>
on homeschooling, and reconfirmed their position at the 2000 annual  <br/>
meeting. Members who want this policy reviewed may submit a proposal  <br/>
to the Resolutions Committee for presentation at the RA.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for your comments and the materials on homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Bob Chase<br/>
President<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454083723">We had a copy of the &quot;affirmation&quot; of this resolution on my fridge<br/>
until recently, when we decided to remove it because of the negativity<br/>
it represented and replace it with an affirmation of our own, a<br/>
statement of how WE want to be in the world - an RU family living<br/>
joyfully.<br/>
<br/>
The resolution strikes me as very arrogant, makes a lot of erroneous<br/>
assumptions, and is based on a very one-sided and profoundly misguided<br/>
view of how learning happens. It also concludes (wrongly imo) that<br/>
schools *do* provide the things that they feel homeschooling does not<br/>
- such as a &quot;comprehensive education experience&quot; and an &quot;opportunity<br/>
to interact with students of different cultures&quot;. From this side of<br/>
the fence, where my children are freely and happily learning everyday<br/>
in the real world, it can be maddening to read this sort of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s good to keep in mind that the NEA operates as a union. Last<br/>
year they had an operating budget of around $310 million. They<br/>
represent a class of working people who are concerned about job<br/>
security, financial compensation (their wages), and the growth of<br/>
their industry which includes *increasing* the need for their services<br/>
and creating more opportunities for employment.<br/>
<br/>
This is not to say that some of the members don&#39;t truly feel they are<br/>
working and voting with the best of children in mind, but at the core<br/>
the NEA is a political organization comprised of members who are<br/>
deeply vested in the education industry. One of their taglines is<br/>
&quot;Building great public schools for every child.&quot; Note the phrase in<br/>
the homeschooling resolution about &quot;all expenses should be borne by<br/>
the parents&quot;. What does this have to do with the well being of<br/>
children? Nothing - but they don&#39;t want state or federal money that<br/>
could be funneled into their industry somehow ending up in our<br/>
pockets.<br/>
<br/>
From the NEA website:<br/>
* * * NEA exists to improve the quality of public education and serve<br/>
the needs of its members. The two go hand-in-hand. The Association<br/>
knows that the quality of education our teachers deliver is linked to<br/>
their working conditions. NEA seeks to enhance the professionalism of<br/>
education employees by providing them with opportunities to develop<br/>
their skills and improve their teaching techniques. NEA also advocates<br/>
for the kind of employment rights, economic benefits and working<br/>
conditions that they as professionals deserve. For this reason, NEA<br/>
spends a comparable amount of money advocating for qualified teachers<br/>
in every classroom, improving reading skills, promoting school<br/>
construction and modernization, building bipartisan support for public<br/>
education and advocating for safe and orderly schools. * * *<br/>
<br/>
You can see how homeschoolers - especially happy, successful<br/>
homeschoolers who are achieving that success without state-mandated<br/>
curriculums and teacher oversight - can be perceived as threatening to<br/>
their livelihood. What if the word got out that learning is *natural*<br/>
and inevitable? What if more parents realized their children can<br/>
thrive without classrooms?  What if society realized it&#39;s entirely<br/>
possible to reach adulthood as intelligent, interesting, productive,<br/>
well-rounded people without being subjected to 12 years of structured<br/>
programming in a taxpayer-funded multi-billion dollar industry?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s no surprise that their official stance is very critical of homeschooling.<br/>

I loved hearing John Taylor Gatto talk about this issue at the recent<br/>
RE conference. I think he covers a lot about the money tied to public<br/>
education in &quot;Dumbing us Down&quot; ....I might be remembering wrong. Need<br/>
to go look again.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, according to Mr. Gatto, the public education system today is<br/>
our top industry in this country  when you include all the<br/>
supplemental stuff like chalk and desks  and other items that aren&#39;t<br/>
included in the statistics for funds. BIG money tied to schools. All<br/>
over the place. No wonder they hate what we&#39;re doing. <br/>
<br/>
If everyone homeschooled, where would all that industry go? Many<br/>
companies would fold of course. Unschoolers are a big threat to a way<br/>
of life for many people.  Good says I.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019686716">So basically they are saying education should be a &quot;One size fits all&quot; <br/>
system. I think that&#39;s what gets my goat about the whole thing. The <br/>
public school system is so concerned about making well rounded students, <br/>
that they are no longer concerned about a student&#39;s strengths. It seems <br/>
they want to make everyone fit through a round hole, even if they end up <br/>
rounding off the corners in the process. All of those square, <br/>
triangular, rectangular and oddly shaped pegs just get forced through <br/>
the round hole so that in the end, you end up with a lot of homogenized <br/>
pegs with no individual character whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>

  Just the retail loss would be devastating -- back-to-schools, school supplies, new shoes, backpacks, athletic equipment, laptops, etc. The loss would lead to all kinds of downsizing in the retail industry, too.<br/>
   <br/>
  The general labor hit would be even worse, tho.  We&#39;d have no need for school bus drivers, cafeteria workers, teachers, principals, secretaries, admin staff, guidance counselors, special tutors, janitors, nurses, coaches, the people involved in transporting all the school supplies and foodservice supplies.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Office supply manufacturers would be hard-hit -- and what about the ad agencies that write all the back-to-school commercials? The TV shows supported by those commercials? The Dept of Education with all its curriculum writers, policy makers, PR guys, and data analysts -- all would be out of jobs.  Construction companies that build and renovate school facilities.<br/>
   <br/>
  But just think of what could be saved in natural resources -- no need to light, heat/cool and supply water to huge, ineffecient mass education facilities.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Of course, with all the people who&#39;d be out of work if compulsory school didn&#39;t exist, we&#39;d have the  then-free teens seeking jobs, too -- in a very tight job market.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m reading Escape From Childhood by John Holt, wherein he makes the case that often dependency in children is maintained by adults to meet the needs of adults.  I can see where the modern school system does exactly that in countless ways. <br/>
