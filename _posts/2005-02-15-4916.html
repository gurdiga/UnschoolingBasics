&gt;etc. and now it&#39;s in danger of being shut down because I don&#39;t have<br/>

&gt;location ~ and I would still welcome anyone from any location who is<br/>
&gt;into the same theories ~ I just hope to get some &quot;locals&quot; as well so<br/>
&gt;perhaps we could plan some outings or have some playdates,etc. I<br/>
&gt;know there is a group for KS but we;re closer to Columbia or Jeff<br/>
&gt;City. I hope it&#39;s okey with the board owners that I post the link<br/>
