So how  did you guys who have chosen a guardian decide on them? <br/>
And how did you go  about putting your wishes in writing?  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
It was very difficult for us.  Both dh and I have siblings, and  we would <br/>
want NONE of them to be guardians for our children.  So I started  making <br/>
friends.  We were new to NC and I knew of no unschooling  families.  I put myself out <br/>
there and they appeared.  I have a large  circle of unschooling friends now.  <br/>
But in getting to know them over the  years it made the decision about <br/>
guardianship easy.  We have chosen friends  as guardians.  They know my children <br/>
more than any family member, they live  consensually so I know my boys thoughts, <br/>
feelings ideas etc would be taken  seriously.  They unschool.  And I can see <br/>
how they live with their own  children, how they problem solve, how they parent <br/>
etc.  That is the most  comforting thing.  <br/>
 <br/>
I see family, either side, maybe once every couple of years.  <br/>
 <br/>
We did put it in writing, in our wills.  With a brief couple of  sentences <br/>
just saying that we trust this couple and have seen them parent their  own <br/>
children, and we feel this couple would make the best fit for our children  <br/>
(something like that).  I know feelings would be hurt if the will were ever  read, <br/>
but my children are my priority, not hurt feelings. <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, just a couple of thoughts,<br/>
