Here&#39;s another attempt to send that link (to the list of Lovecraft films)<br/>
and if this one is truncated I&#39;ll send a tiny url.  Sorry about that. <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to add about &quot;Berkeley Square&quot;... some may be thinking of the<br/>
Henry James story &quot;The Sense of the Past&quot; and I think the film was said<br/>
to be based on that story or a play based on that story when it was<br/>
released.   The connections to Lovecraft come from a letter he wrote a<br/>
friend after seeing the film and from his story &quot;The Case of Charles<br/>
Dexter Ward&quot; written in 1928. (?)   <br/>
<br/>
Like I said, a lot of the movies are shamefully, loosely based on<br/>
Lovecraft stories. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
