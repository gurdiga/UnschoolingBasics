You are sure assuming a lot for someone with such little experience<br/>
and time at this list. Some of us DO have quite a bit of knowledge and<br/>
first hand experience with autism and other &quot;disorders&quot; (I don&#39;t view<br/>
them as disorders, but differences).<br/>
<br/>
RU works for EVERY child because it is all about meeting the child&#39;s<br/>
needs, whatever those may be. There is no willing ignorance or an<br/>
ounce of untruth. Maybe you should get to know more of our stories and<br/>
more of the families here before you make such broad and sweeping<br/>
statements.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to read more about an RU advocate with several autistic<br/>
children (some of them quite severely autistic) you can google Cindy<br/>
Gaddis if you care to learn just how the RU lifestyle plays out with<br/>
very distinct and intense needs.<br/>
<br/>
Right here at this list, we have parents with autistic children...some<br/>
more than one who are living the RU lifestyle all while honoring their<br/>
child&#39;s unique needs.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t possibly understand what radical unschooling means if you<br/>
think it means leaving the child to their own devices. Stick around<br/>
and you might learn.<br/>

Ok. Hang around and wait. And keep sending your daughter to school. Let <br/>
us know how that works out for you---in 12 years, when she&#39;s 20.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled children are *just* now becoming adults. Just these last few <br/>
years. Young children&#39;s parents are *finally* seeing that school <br/>
doesn&#39;t work with their children with autism, so they&#39;re willing to try <br/>
something that honors the child Where He Is NOW instead of relying on <br/>
the schools---schools with their &quot;new concepts&quot; every other year, <br/>
schools with their loud noises and bright lights and major stressors, <br/>

Fine. Many parents here have HAPPY, functioning, delightful kids. With <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023500455">Well, Ren summed it up nicely. I second the raspberry.<br/>
<br/>
You, sir, are not the only person with autism experience on the  <br/>
board, and I replied to the question as the mother of FOUR CHILDREN  <br/>
on the spectrum. After advocating in public schools for over six  <br/>
years, not only for my children in our district, but over two dozen  <br/>
others across the state, I can say I have plenty of experience in  <br/>
public education for children with autism. I can also state that I  <br/>
was fully and completely involved in my children&#39;s education,  <br/>
spending over half of every day in the school building itself. It is  <br/>
quite offensive to assume that because those children did not due  <br/>
well in public schools, that the parents (myself and others) are  <br/>
inattentive and uninvolved.<br/>
<br/>
An involved parent is helpful, yes, but so is respect for the person  <br/>
with autism (rather than calling them &#39;one trick ponies&#39;) and working  <br/>
within their comfort level, will help them just as much as forcing  <br/>
them into situations in which they feel they must change who they are  <br/>
in to be respected. I KNOW several unschooling children with autism  <br/>
outside of my own four, and I do know that it works very well.  <br/>
Perhaps it is the parenting, as you suggest. Since you did not  <br/>
unschool your daughter, and have such strong opinions against it that  <br/>
it would not work, I suggest that you don&#39;t have the data to prove  <br/>
that it would not work.<br/>

more difficult for you to get useful answers. People here answer  <br/>

point of antagonism when they could spend their time on someone who  <br/>
says essentially &quot;I&#39;ve done my research. This appeals to me. I some  <br/>
places where I&#39;m confused.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

&gt; would say i find that in direct proportion to the involvement and<br/>
&gt; maneer of involvement of the parents.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can only guess what the above means.<br/>
<br/>
If you mean that kids have great experiences in school because their  <br/>
parents are involved I wish that were all it took. If that were so,  <br/>
schools would have found a way to tap that power long ago.  <br/>
Occasionally a dynamic will work with the right mix of people, but  <br/>
it&#39;s not recreatable. If that sounds ignorant, what you&#39;re saying is  <br/>
that despite 10s of 1000s of educators spending their life trying to  <br/>
improve schools since the tail end of the 1950&#39;s (Sputnik was the big  <br/>
push), finally your school has discovered that it&#39;s parent  <br/>
involvement that works. Does that sound feasible?<br/>
<br/>
If you want research, try John Holt&#39;s books and read them in order.  <br/>
He began with school reform. You can see the evolution of his  <br/>
thoughts and why he ultimately concluded that schools can&#39;t work  <br/>
because learning needs the freedom to explore. (Which, again, is more  <br/>
than your idea of let them explore on their own.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; while i am inclined to believe<br/>
&gt; that some children advance themselves by inner drive and desire to<br/>
&gt; learn and grow without incentive or direction<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some kids are independent learners. Unschooling isn&#39;t independent  <br/>
learning. Unschooling takes more parent involvement than any other  <br/>
form of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  i can unequivocally say<br/>
&gt; that to carte blanche say that this methodology would work as well for<br/>
&gt; a child with autism as one without is in my sincere opinion either<br/>
&gt; willfully untruthful or benignly ignorant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can state it, but is it true? Lots of teachers would  <br/>
unequivocally state that kids won&#39;t learn to read or do math without  <br/>
instruction. They &quot;know&quot; that&#39;s true because, even with the &quot;best  <br/>
instruction&quot; some kids succeed and some kids fail.<br/>
<br/>
But, they&#39;re basing their conclusions on speculation, not knowledge.  <br/>
Only unschoolers have seen what kids are capable of both with and  <br/>
without direct instruction. We know the effects of each. Only  <br/>
unschoolers have a control group for the experiment. Educators only  <br/>
have guesses.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d get better answers if you sincerely ask for the experiences of  <br/>
parents with autistic kids without attacking them and everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what i<br/>
&gt; have yet to see is the adult children who have been raised this way<br/>
&gt; with RU and where are their testimonies?  where are the parents of 22<br/>
&gt; year olds who were raised this way for 20 or so of their years<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Autistic kids? Or all kids? Those stories come out over time. My  <br/>
daughter is 16. She&#39;s not only an incredibly nice kid (I&#39;m biased but  <br/>
other adults have spontaneously said so :-) but living her life  <br/>
towards college. She&#39;s been taking college classes since she was 11  <br/>
just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a fluke and it&#39;s not a crap shoot. The parenting decisions I  <br/>
made have been turned over and discussed and held up for examination.  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen the results in my daughter and in the children of the  <br/>
unschooling parents I&#39;ve known for 12 years. It&#39;s not a theory. It&#39;s  <br/>
critical thinking and observation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i say scientifically that is not<br/>
&gt; sufficient data<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you want data, we&#39;re not going to hand it to you. It comes out  <br/>
when people ask relevant questions, not at one person&#39;s command. It&#39;s  <br/>
in the archives and you can dig for it. Now, if you want to pay  <br/>
someone for their time, you could make an offer! Otherwise it&#39;s more  <br/>
efficient to use my time to help people who&#39;ve done their own  <br/>
research and aren&#39;t beginning from a point of view of &quot;Prove it to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

Any discussion, though, bring here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; please direct me if there are those who can to the<br/>
&gt; long term results not the theories.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Come to an unschooling conference and you can see the results first  <br/>
hand. I&#39;ve been involved with unschooling since my daughter was 4 and  <br/>
many of the people I began with are still around with grown or nearly  <br/>
grown kids answering questions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am sorry if my directness<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really not sure how offending people and being belligerent and  <br/>
demanding that people volunteer their time in a specific way to help  <br/>
you could possibly help your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Ask questions in a way that shows that you&#39;re open to trying to  <br/>
understand and people will be more than happy to help. Begin from a  <br/>
point of view of &quot;You&#39;re wrong and show me that you aren&#39;t,&quot; and it  <br/>
isn&#39;t likely to get you very much.<br/>

built to learn, it&#39;s what we *do.*<br/>
It is also true, and more important to understand, unschooling doesn&#39;t<br/>
always work for all parents (especially those who are products of the system<br/>
themselves, and *more* especially for those who liked life within the<br/>
system). It&#39;s a lot of work, it&#39;s a building of relationships where society<br/>
would have them be torn down, it&#39;s like a holistic intimacy - facilitating<br/>
joyful life in the moment. Every child brings gifts, unschooling gives us<br/>
far more opportunities to receive those gifts and appreciate them. And learn<br/>
a whole heck of a lot about your own self in the process (which seems to be<br/>
an across the board benefit to this lifestyle).<br/>
I&#39;m lots and lots of things, including crazy and maybe a bit loud and<br/>
outspoken (just a bit :::bg:::), though *not* willfully untruthful nor<br/>
benignly ignorant. Intelligence can be bliss, too :)<br/>

<br/>
I took a teaching job at my son&#39;s school so I could be more <br/>
involved.  His teacher is a good friend of mine - we go to each <br/>
others houses, have each other in speed dial, etc.  I brought a <br/>
specialist in from Emory University to do an autism workshop with the <br/>
entire school staff.  I paid an ungodly sum of money for my son to <br/>
attend a private school where he would have a 6:1 student:teacher <br/>
ratio.  I fought the system to force them to provide OT for my boy.<br/>
<br/>
AND you want to say I wasn&#39;t involved.  In what dimension are living <br/>
that it makes it ok for you to make those kind of assumptions?<br/>
<br/>
I took all of my kids out of school a little over a year ago.  We <br/>
started RU last fall.  I&#39;ve seen an amazing improvement in my boy.  <br/>
He no longer monologues about Bionicles (I guess you could say RU <br/>
cured him of being a &quot;one trick pony,&quot; to use your phrase). His <br/>
stimming has completely dissappeared - yeah!  I could go on about all <br/>
of the positive changes, but you don&#39;t really care about making a <br/>
child&#39;s life wonderful in the here and now, do you?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t assume you are the only person on this list with a child on the <br/>
spectrum.  Don&#39;t assume you are the only one who gives a damn.  Don&#39;t <br/>
assume you know everything.<br/>

I think that you will find that those of us on this list who actually <br/>
are RUers are pretty damn happy with the lives our spectrum kids have.  <br/>
It&#39;s amazing how any child can blossom when you learn to love him and <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>

&gt; ***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I, like you, initially believed that school would be good and helpful<br/>
for my high functioning autisic son.  After all, I had no previous<br/>
experience with autism and having a thorough system of teachers, <br/>
doctors and therapists on hand seemed reasonable to me at the time. I<br/>
was involved, I was informed, I was there every day. Unfortunately, I<br/>
also ended up watching my child lose confidence, joy, ability and<br/>
self-esteem while buying into the belief that the &#39;experts&#39; were doing<br/>
what was best for him.  Yes he learned to do schooly things, but<br/>
mostly he learned to hate who he was. <br/>
<br/>
It took me longer than I care to admit, but I pulled him out of school<br/>
when I finally realized that they were not helping him, they were<br/>
deeply hurting him. He even told me this himself at some point, while<br/>
I continued to assure him that he would be fine once we completed the<br/>
next round of OT, or social skills classes, or testing, or whatever<br/>
the hell was next on the long list of these truly trial-and-error<br/>
programs. <br/>
<br/>
We are now unschooling. We are just beginning to see some of the &quot;old<br/>
Jack&quot; return.  It was almost completely wiped out by 4 years of<br/>
school. He says, &quot;I just want things to be like they were before.&quot;<br/>
Perhaps this is not your experience with school and autism. I hope it<br/>
does not become yours. But it is ours.<br/>
 <br/>
Do you really think that research can tell you how your child will or<br/>
will not function in a system full of unknowns? <br/>
<br/>
There is no kind of research to calculate the &quot;facts&quot; you are looking<br/>
for. School has not been scientifically tested against all the variables. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229631982">I kinda agree that RU *won&#39;t* work in all families. Has nothing to do<br/>
with whether or not any/all of the children are on the autism spectrum.<br/>
Has everything to do with whether the parents are willing to put the<br/>
time and energy into changing basically everything they thought they<br/>
knew from the ground up and learn from their children. And if someone is<br/>
not able to put in the time to see each individual child as a wonderful<br/>
WHOLE being and not a set of behaviors and perseverations and whatever<br/>
other diagnostic stuff they&#39;ve come up with, then it&#39;s not going to<br/>
&quot;work&quot;. It&#39;s not a set procedure or set of instructions - it&#39;s not &quot;do 2<br/>
hours of sitting on the floor face to face three times per week and all<br/>
will be well&quot; It&#39;s actually pretty messy, this living life with other<br/>
people thing. Because every person is different than you are and does<br/>
things differently, sees the world differently, reacts differently.<br/>
That&#39;s not &quot;broken&quot; that&#39;s just different. But different gets messy. And<br/>
&quot;more different&quot; is more messy, so it &quot;has to&quot; be &#39;controlled&#39; enough to<br/>
squeeze into the usual and accepted level of messiness (or does it?).<br/>
<br/>
Sure, there are probably good ideas within the clinical information on<br/>
assisting people with autism be at peace within themselves and able to<br/>
cope with the big wide world and those ideas can and should be<br/>
incorporated in whatever way works best for the individuals involved.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that RU and raising a child on the spectrum are<br/>
incompatible. That just means lots and lots of working, and observing,<br/>
and revising, and do-overs to find what tools are most useful for any<br/>
individual at a given time/situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667704879">Just a little confused... what is RU?<br/>
<br/>
My 9 (soon to be 10) year old son has autism.<br/>
Initially, he was going to special ed classes at the<br/>
public school... kinda like kindergarten, 1/2 day 5<br/>
times a week. And there was good that did come from<br/>
it. There was negative too... but I felt at the time<br/>
that the good outweighed the bad. Then we tried to<br/>
mainstream him into regular kindergarten with a full<br/>
time aide (he&#39;s high functioning). That was when it<br/>
all went terribly south. I&#39;ve been homeschooling him<br/>
ever since and I think he&#39;s doing so much better. We<br/>
don&#39;t completely unschool... as I have to push him a<br/>
little sometimes, but I try to give him as much<br/>
freedom as possible (his dad isn&#39;t happy with the<br/>
unschool approach... he thinks I&#39;m doing it wrong and<br/>
he&#39;s worried that our son isn&#39;t learning the<br/>
requirements that all children are supposed to learn<br/>
in school).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-860017973">Paul, if you think your daughter is doing well, fine.  She is only 8.<br/>
 When you get to the middle grades you may regret allowing her to<br/>
remain. I made that mistake. I could go on and on about the watered<br/>
down curriculum, etc.  If you haven&#39;t read any books by John Holt,<br/>
please do so.  They will help you gain perspective on the difference<br/>
between learning and being taught. <br/>
<br/>
As for my son on the spectrum...taking him out of the public school<br/>
system has had an possitive impact on him.  Not only is he learning in<br/>
freedom and learning at a more advanced level (his own choice) than<br/>
the &quot;standardized curriculum&quot; he was being fed, but he is also living<br/>
without medication.  <br/>
<br/>
I see my son&#39;s &quot;perseverations&quot; as gifts.  Therein lies our difference<br/>
in philosphy. As for ASD adults Temple Grandin credits her own mother<br/>
with believing in her. I would also put Thomas Edison&#39;s mom is this<br/>
same category.  <br/>

&gt; lot of things in the last week on this group and many have been quite <br/>
&gt; insightful while others are clearly based on ignorance of the human <br/>
&gt; body and its chemical make up.  I am chosing to treat the group like a <br/>
&gt; chicken dinner i eat the meat and throw out the bones at this point, <br/>
&gt; however autism is an area that i have specific personal experience and <br/>
&gt; act as an advocate for a number of children in my community and knowing <br/>
&gt; what i KNOW about this neurological disorder i can unequivocally say <br/>
&gt; that to carte blanche say that this methodology would work as well for <br/>
&gt; a child with autism as one without is in my sincere opinion either <br/>
&gt; willfully untruthful or benignly ignorant. in either case it is not <br/>
&gt; something i can in good conscience let pass without comment. what i <br/>
&gt; have yet to see is the adult children who have been raised this way <br/>
&gt; with RU and where are their testimonies?  where are the parents of 22 <br/>
&gt; year olds who were raised this way for 20 or so of their years. i hear <br/>
&gt; story after story of people who are trying this and trying that, who <br/>
&gt; have been doing this for 2 3 or 5 years and have a 6 or 9 yr old even a <br/>
&gt; few who have teens who have been raised in other ways who once switched <br/>
&gt; to Ru are doing well after 1 year, i say scientifically that is not <br/>
&gt; sufficient data. please direct me if there are those who can to the <br/>
&gt; long term results not the theories.  I am sorry if my directness <br/>
&gt; offends any but my daughter is worth more to me that all of your <br/>
&gt; feelings combined and i will gladly offend all of you if it would help <br/>
&gt; her by helping me get to the truth of something that may work or not <br/>
&gt; work with and for her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-588564776">Ok, here goes.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First off, I feel that I should and need to appologize for my tone in <br/>
my initial post it was combative and that really should not have <br/>
happened.  My goal is not to anger anyone on or off this list/group. <br/>
 <br/>
I have been reading the posts on the group for answers to my questions <br/>
about unschooling, and was fustrated that I could not find answers to <br/>
some of my core concerns.  This is not only new to me and change can be <br/>
a bit difficult especially since i am proposing changing from something <br/>
that i know mainly how it works to an environment i am unfamiliar <br/>
with.  Also i have not experienced any personal horrors in my own life <br/>
nor in my daughters that were caused by traditional methods. I <br/>
aknowledge that US appeals to my head and my heart but am a little <br/>
skeptical without some sense of real understanding of the future. <br/>
Remember i am putting the most valuable person in my life at risk here. <br/>
please recall what it was like to make these decisions for the first <br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
Now admittedly, my awareness of my frustration level should have caused <br/>
me to stop and calm down and collect my thoughts better before writing <br/>
to an open forum. <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I would like to thank Pat, Ren, Joyce and Sharissa13 for <br/>
actually having real concrete things to say you were quite helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-797211560">I&#39;m far behind and haven&#39;t read this whole thread yet.<br/>
<br/>
*** we had her in a montessori school at first<br/>
thinking that the freedom to learn would engender a sense of self<br/>
gratification and hopefully catapult her into a state of fulfillment<br/>
that i read about on this board.***<br/>
<br/>
This is an unschooling list, not a Montessori list.   If you were expecting to see the benefits of unschooling while your daughter was enrolled in school that was an unrealistic expectation.   You should have expected the benefits of a Montessori education (whatever those are) and if she didn&#39;t receive those then that&#39;s a matter you should take up with her school.   <br/>
<br/>
***however that failed to materialize as<br/>
she chose to perseverate on specific tasks and areas so much that she<br/>
was turning into a one trick pony. ***<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people specialize and do well.  We may think of Stephen Hawking as a physicist or mathematics professor but he&#39;s also someone&#39;s son, husband, father, grandfather, friend.  There&#39;s more to every life than what onlookers see.  Sometimes parents write that their kids aren&#39;t doing anything when the truth is their kids aren&#39;t doing the kinds of things the parents think they ought to be doing.   Sometimes they write and say &quot;all he ever does is....&quot; or something similar and in every case I&#39;ve seen, after the parent writes more, we find out the kid is doing LOTS of things, just not things the parent thinks of as meaningful.   <br/>
<br/>
Kids who learn by immersing themselves in a certain thing until they&#39;ve absorbed everything they want can look to outsiders like they&#39;re only doing one thing.  But there&#39;s a lot going on in a learning mind, lots of connections being made and no matter how involved and intense a kid is they are always doing something else.  They eventually stop to sleep... they eat...they visit with family members, and in doing those things, they&#39;re learning all the time, too. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;One trick pony&quot; is pretty demeaning.  I know if you&#39;d given it more thought you could have come up with half a dozen things your daughter enjoyed doing.  You might have had to look beyond the things you consider worthwhile.    Maybe you don&#39;t understand yet that unschooling doesn&#39;t mean your daughter will learn school subjects.  It means she&#39;ll learn what she&#39;s interested in and that may not look at all like anything you&#39;d find in a school.<br/>
<br/>
*** while i am inclined to believe<br/>
that some children advance themselves by inner drive and desire to<br/>
learn and grow without incentive or direction, *** <br/>
<br/>
What you wrote is difficult to follow but I think you&#39;re saying you believe incentive and direction must come from outside the child.   Children have their own direction and pursue their own interests very well.  They might need our help getting to what they want but they certainly don&#39;t need us to decide for them what they want.    When a child wants something they don&#39;t need us offering up rewards or punishments.  We can offer help in whatever form they need and they&#39;ll pursue what they&#39;re interested in until they&#39;ve had enough.   <br/>
<br/>
***just as we can clearly<br/>
say that some children can eat peanut butter with joy and others are<br/>
allergic it is only reasonable to understand and to believe that the<br/>
same is true for a learning and living style like RU.***<br/>
  <br/>
Learning is not a histamine response.&lt;g&gt;  It doesn&#39;t seem reasonable at all to think that since some kids have allergies that means some other kids can&#39;t learn, so maybe you meant something else.  You maybe meant all kids are different and so you can&#39;t see how one thing can work for all kids.  Unschooling isn&#39;t like school where someone decides what every kid should know and then tries to cram it into each kid the same way at the same time.  Unschooling is living life and picking up information in a natural way.   It will not look like school learning, it can&#39;t be tested for and it probably won&#39;t hit the dots on a scope and sequence chart.   It&#39;s individual and natural and that&#39;s why it works for every child.  Every child learns what they want to learn.  It doesn&#39;t mean your daughter will have mastered algebra by the time she&#39;s fourteen.  It will mean if she&#39;s interested in algebra (or knitting or rebuilding transmissions, or playing piano or making paper airplanes) she&#39;ll have the time and freedom to learn as much as she wants. <br/>
<br/>
***to carte blanche say that this methodology would work as well for<br/>
a child with autism as one without is in my sincere opinion either<br/>
willfully untruthful or benignly ignorant.***<br/>
<br/>
Autistic children will benefit from a learning environment that meets their specific needs.    Just like every other kid.  Unschooling lets parents meet the needs of their children.  But there&#39;s a big difference between meeting the needs of a child and pacifying the worries of a parent who wants to direct a child&#39;s learning.     Some parents can&#39;t get it, can&#39;t get comfortable with the idea that while kids might need our help to get to what they want they don&#39;t need us to tell them what they should want.   It might be too far out of your comfort zone to let your child learn what she wants to learn in her own way and in her own time but that does not mean unschooling wouldn&#39;t work for her.    It&#39;s not a methodology like you&#39;re  familiar with from school.  You won&#39;t get to decide what subjects are important for her to study.  You get to help your daughter do what she&#39;s interested in doing. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, you&#39;ll find a lot of understanding about that issue, many<br/>
of us have been there.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your ability to come back after that &quot;thrashing&quot; and<br/>
being willing to openly discuss unschooling. I admit to having my<br/>
feathers ruffled in the first go round.:) I have a very intense child<br/>
who would probably have been diagnosed with a couple of labels but we<br/>
chose to avoid that as we felt equipped to support him without that. <br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ll find an amazing amount of sympathy for the questions<br/>
and fears that arise when one first encounters this lifestyle. So many<br/>
of us have faced those questions, dug really deep and faced our fears.<br/>
When someone comes along and accuses us of being willingly<br/>
ignorant...well, that&#39;s a tough one to swallow after SO much<br/>
questioning, stretching, changing and being willing to go where we<br/>
weren&#39;t sure about going!<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I think if you can handle the intensity of those posts,<br/>
you&#39;ll be quite comfortable with a list designed for discussion<br/>
purposes. Oh, critical thinking highly encouraged.:)<br/>

<br/>
I have been reading the posts on the group for answers to my questions<br/>
about unschooling, and was fustrated that I could not find answers to<br/>
some of my core concerns.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
Then you&#39;re not looking hard enough.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve answered all the questions and concerns you may have for years. I <br/>
bet there&#39;s not *one* we haven&#39;t heard! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you read the archives here? Or just the last three days&#39; worth of <br/>
messages?<br/>
<br/>
Have you looked at and read through all of  <br/>
www.sandradodd.com/unschooling  or  www.joyfullyrejoycing.com ?<br/>
<br/>
Have you read Rue&#39;s book, Parenting a Free Child, An Unschooled Life?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 This is not only new to me and change can be<br/>
a bit difficult especially since i am proposing changing from something<br/>
that i know mainly how it works to an environment i am unfamiliar<br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Just as each and every one of us has/is.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s ONE person here who was unschooled as a child <br/>
(except my 20 year old son, who occasionally reads here). We were all <br/>
traditionally parented (some better than others), and we all went to <br/>
school (some better than others).<br/>
<br/>
You are no different.<br/>
<br/>
The difference is that we have walked on both sides of the fence, and <br/>
you have been only on one. *WE* have made an educated decision. *You* <br/>
are basing things on only one set of data.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Also i have not experienced any personal horrors in my own life<br/>
nor in my daughters that were caused by traditional methods.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My childhood was decent. Not as good as it could have been. Not as good <br/>
as my children&#39;s. But I was privileged in many ways. My school <br/>
experience was quite good, seeing as there was no homeschool option <br/>
back then. I have a &quot;good education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I bet that, when you start actually *thinking* about the childhood you <br/>
had versus the childhood you *could* have had had your parents known <br/>
better, you may feel different about your and your parents&#39; <br/>
&quot;traditional methods.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Had we not found this path, my boys would be in school. It&#39;s just that <br/>
we found something better. A lot better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I aknowledge that US appeals to my head and my heart but am a little<br/>
skeptical without some sense of real understanding of the future.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And as soon as you can *tell* me the future, I&#39;ll buy that statement.<br/>
<br/>
No one understands the future.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Remember i am putting the most valuable person in my life at risk here.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;re not?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
please recall what it was like to make these decisions for the first<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I do. And it&#39;s scary. But as soon as you *understand* it, unschooling <br/>
and mindful parenting make all the sense in the world.<br/>
<br/>
You have to be open to it though. Quit fighting. Question with an open <br/>
mind---not thinking about how it *won&#39;t* work. Think about how it <br/>
*will*.<br/>
<br/>
Schools work with your weaknesses. Unschooling works with your <br/>
strengths.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Now admittedly, my awareness of my frustration level should have caused<br/>
me to stop and calm down and collect my thoughts better before writing<br/>
to an open forum.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Deep breaths. Give us concrete examples.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s really not a question you can ask that we haven&#39;t already <br/>
answered at least once.<br/>
