<div id="ygrps-yiv-946370690">Way back on Feb. 28 Lesa suggested I read the Teenage Liberation Handbook.  We couldn&#39;t <br/>
find it.  Just as I was starting to feel &quot;pressure&quot; from the rest of the world(grandparents, <br/>
friends, school friends of Lily&#39;s) the book appeared, our local librarian found it.  It has helped, <br/>
and I just got it yesterday!!    Lily is reading it a bit also. So far so good, Thanks for pointing <br/>
me in the direction that allowed me to trust her and myself.  Melanie in Vt</div>
