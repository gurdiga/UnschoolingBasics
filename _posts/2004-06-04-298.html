<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888190070">Well, thanks for taking the time to answer, Helen. So all this renaming of <br/>
things and shuffling of lists is not about any real change in trying to <br/>
communicate better within the hsing community. Same answer, indeed. How sad.<br/>
<br/>
So what lists are left -- not Helen&#39;s lists -- that are about &quot;unschooling?&quot; <br/>
This one. :) Then there is the UnschoolingDiscussion list. Is that about it?<br/>

There&#39;s Sandra&#39;s e-list, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">_AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>_ <br/>
(mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>)    , but it&#39;s not recommended for new unschoolers, more <br/>
for those who &quot;get it&quot;  already. It&#39;s not really a question and anwer kind of <br/>
list. But it&#39;s ALL  unschoolers.<br/>

  If you look at yahoo there are several. Some are areas, like NJ<br/>
unscholers, etc. Someone (Pam?) made the point wondering whether HEM will<br/>
make all their lists general. Why only the unschooling lists? Make you, ME,<br/>
wonder. I could go on but....Well that&#39;s enough rebel rousing. ;-)<br/>
