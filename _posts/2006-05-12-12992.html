2.5 yos don&#39;t need to play with other kids. If they&#39;re asking they  <br/>
don&#39;t mean the same thing that a 6 yo does.<br/>
So true! I&#39;ve found that when other 2 year olds Moms say that their kids miss <br/>
their friends or want to have a playdate it is usually the Mom&#39;s wishes or <br/>
just the kids repeating what they&#39;ve heard from their moms or older siblings.  <br/>
You and your daughter have plenty of time to go to playgroups and make friends. <br/>
 Why rush things?  <br/>
<br/>
I have found some playgroups to be like an unhealthy extension of <br/>
dysfunctional high school where everyone is trying to out do each other with regard to <br/>
parenting and their children&#39;s development.  Its like a contest.  It sounds like <br/>
you may be caught up in that.  There is no reason to compare your 2.5 year <br/>
old to others or expect her to act a certain way because other people claim <br/>
their little ones are doing something remarkable.  Revel in your daughter&#39;s <br/>
uniqueness and follow her lead.  Trust her to know what she needs and wants and read <br/>
her cues.  If you take the playgroup people out of the picture and stop <br/>
comparing her to other kids you will see that she is absolutely perfect in every <br/>
way.  If your daughter read what you have written about her I think she be <br/>
devastated by what you&#39;ve said.  She has probably overheard you saying similar <br/>
things to your friends, family or spouse.  Consider her self esteem.  She won&#39;t <br/>
feel good about herself because she has a lot of friends and an active social <br/>
life at age 2 but what you think and say about her will deeply affect her self <br/>
esteem.<br/>
<br/>
I read a book 8-9 years ago about raising a gifted child (when I was trying <br/>
to keep my 2 year old up to speed and I was caught up in the drama some new <br/>
parents create for themselves) and one of the few things I remember from it is <br/>
that limiting contact with other children is very healthy for young, brilliant <br/>
children.  It was worded something like: Preschool aged children should have <br/>
limited contact with outsiders.  I retained nothing else from that book so I <br/>
guess that is all I needed to learn from it at the time.  It slowed us down back <br/>
then.<br/>
<br/>
Playgroups at that age aren&#39;t really for the children, they&#39;re for the Moms.  <br/>
I learned that 9 years ago, too.  That&#39;s why they&#39;re usually called a Mom&#39;s <br/>
club and not a children&#39;s club. Are you willing to look at other options for <br/>
yourself?<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Robin in MA, who has been responding a lot because it has been raining here <br/>
for days.  I am thirsty for social interaction but my kids just want to create <br/>
a Fashion Polly world here in the den.  They are taking their dolls on a <br/>
cruise this morning, life vests and all.  <br/>

of the parents of homeschoolers have children who are &quot;wunderkinds&quot; in their<br/>
eyes.  &quot;Oh, well, my Johnny was playing violin when he was 3 and now at 10<br/>

decided to study astronomic physics&quot; or bragging about their wonderful<br/>
scores on &quot;such and such standardized test.&quot;  And there sits Johnny as bored<br/>

<br/>
There was an episode of Law & Order that I caught the other night.  I think<br/>
it was Criminal Intent.  But it portrayed a dad who had homeschooled his son<br/>
and his son was one of these supposed &quot;super geniuses.&quot;  The kid was<br/>
miserable in his life.  All he wanted to do was play baseball.  All his<br/>
father wanted him to do was be &quot;the best&quot; literally.  Pushed him so hard and<br/>
sucked all the joy out of life.  It was all or nothing.  I felt so sad for<br/>
this little boy.  If memory serves me correct he told his father that he<br/>
wasn&#39;t going to get the psych evaluation he needed to get into some<br/>
prestigious school (which was a lie) so the father killed the psych<br/>
evaluator.  The boy was hoping that if he didn&#39;t get into this school he<br/>
could play baseball on Saturdays.  There was a &quot;happy&quot; part to the story in<br/>
that one of the other kids who had been in this same program and dropped out<br/>
was portrayed as a happy easy going and following his own dreams kid.  Must<br/>
have gotten ahold of the Teenage Liberation Handbook :)  But I see parents<br/>
like this all the time.  I run into other homeschooling families when we go<br/>
out.  Mom at a park with 3 school aged kids during school = homeschool.<br/>
They strike up a conversation and the first thing they start doing is<br/>
grilling you on what grade your children are doing and what curriculum you<br/>
are using and how far &quot;ahead&quot; they are.  They are shocked when I say, &quot;We<br/>
don&#39;t use a curriculum and I have no idea what grade the kids would be in.&quot;<br/>
And it is true.  We went to the bookstore and were talking to the children&#39;s<br/>
manager about other books Mary Elayne might like and the manager asked me<br/>
what grade she was in.  I just stood there with a blank stare because A) I<br/>
have no clue (the kids figured out she would be entering 5th grade - maybe<br/>
6th LOL), and B) grade has no bearing on reading ability nor interest.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>DS (he&#39;s almost 8 and never been schooled) thinks that simply <br/>
saying &quot;we homeschool&quot; should answer/end any questions related to <br/>
grade levels or subjects or anything school-related. As far as he&#39;s <br/>
concerned, grade levels don&#39;t exist when you &quot;homeschool&quot;. When <br/>
we&#39;ve been asked what grade he&#39;s in, we just say &quot;He&#39;s almost 8&quot; or <br/>
whatever his current age is and let them assume whatever they choose <br/>
to assume. One time, a newish-acquaintance (who knew <br/>
we &quot;homeschooled&quot; but that&#39;s about it) asked him what his favorite <br/>
subject was. I paused, to give him time to answer if he wanted to, <br/>
and I could see him thinking really hard. Then he got a big smile on <br/>
his face and he said &quot;Videogames!&quot; and wandered away. I thought it a <br/>
wonderful answer. He got asked what grade he was in last Friday by a <br/>
friend we hadn&#39;t seen in a while who homeschooled her own kids for <br/>
about 9 years (the youngest is now in high school, the middle one is <br/>
in college and the eldest is in the Air Force). He just said &quot;we <br/>
homeschool&quot;. Then she noticed our chalkboard (an 8&#39;x4&#39; section of <br/>
kitchen wall - hard to miss lol!) He proceeded to point out stuff on <br/>
it - the protein list, the multiplication table, etc (things he&#39;s <br/>
asked to have available). So, she asked him what his favorite <br/>
subject was. He pondered and pondered and pondered and I said &quot;we <br/>
don&#39;t have subjects&quot;. So then she said &quot;Oh, you unschool?&quot; I said <br/>
Yup (hey, she knew the terminology - 1 point for her). Then, I could <br/>
tell she was really trying, she said &quot;so what is your favorite thing <br/>
you&#39;ve been learning about? What do you like to do?&quot; he still <br/>
pondered and thought and didn&#39;t answer really. Later on, DH <br/>
said &quot;Hmm could we be missing something here?&quot; (not that he&#39;s likely <br/>
to do anything different - he&#39;s 100% sold on unschooling - but maybe <br/>
we&#39;ve gotten staganant, need to get out of a rut). I said that given <br/>
the context of &quot;subjects&quot; and all, I could see where it would be a <br/>
tough one for DS to answer. While we were chatting (she&#39;s just <br/>
started Mary Kay so she was doing a facial for me), DS was bopping <br/>
in and out, watching what was happening, chatting about stuff he was <br/>
doing, in general being his usual exuberant, curious, verbal self. <br/>
If she didn&#39;t &#39;get&#39; that he loves Star Wars by the time she left, <br/>
she wasn&#39;t paying attention LOL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153302897">Josh very seriously had one of those kids in his cub scout pack. It  <br/>
was painful because even a kid sent to public school gets a break  <br/>
from overachieving parents. But he was stuck at a table with his mom  <br/>
or dad for ten hours a DAY...and it spilled over into everything. The  <br/>
kid had to do every achievement in the scout handbook, was way ahead  <br/>
in every academic standard. He was very serious, unable to smile, and  <br/>
I wonder what things we could not see. The dad was a prig, anyway,  <br/>
and not very nice to the boys when he was there. We aren&#39;t the drop  <br/>
and run type of parents, and I&#39;m thankful. I called him down so many  <br/>
times that it got to be a joke. They have so many curricula listed in  <br/>
the homeschooling directory that they took up two boxes!<br/>
<br/>
And that was yet another deciding factor in how NOT to homeschool ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While I have no doubt that a child of 8 has the capacity to learn all the<br/>
things needed to enter college, I would wonder *why* an 8 yo CHILD would<br/>
want to go to college?  There is some driving force somewhere, either from<br/>
society or even parents seemingly benignly mentioning it.  I love that a<br/>
child has the desire to want to learn deeper and broader things, but why the<br/>
drive for college?  Something is pushing this child.  She didn&#39;t get the<br/>
idea to go to college on her own.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I have a child that, had I done the &quot;right&quot; pushing, would be one of these<br/>
&quot;wunderkinds&quot; (although I think all my kids are pretty wunderbar!)  She&#39;s<br/>
bright, articulate, and understands things in ways I never could.  She isn&#39;t<br/>
daunted by numbers, never has been.  The little bit she was in school in 5th<br/>
grade she went round and round with her teacher about having to show her<br/>
math work.  He would say, &quot;I need to know how you got the answer.&quot;  She<br/>
would counter, &quot;Is the problem wrong?&quot;  &quot;No; but I need to know that you<br/>
understand what you are doing.&quot;  &quot;Is the problem wrong?&quot;  &quot;No; but how did<br/>
you get to the solution?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s just in my head.  The answer is the only<br/>
logical solution.&quot;  Once she understands how a theory works she is able to<br/>
apply it to anything given to her.  So the  working out long multiplication<br/>
numbers or algebraic equations was a tad pointless to her.  She&#39;s like her<br/>
dad in that she remembers everything she reads or watches on tv.  She<br/>
memorizes songs after listening to them only a time or two.  Her favorite<br/>
thing to do is learn songs in foreign languages (particularly Latin or<br/>
Japanese) and sing them.  She watches anime in Japanese and while she has<br/>
never taken a class she follows the story somehow.  I&#39;ve sat with her and<br/>
watched them and am totally lost.  I will periodically be able to pick out a<br/>
word or phrase that I remember from my childhood, but that&#39;s about it.<br/>
She&#39;ll laugh and I&#39;ll ask why and she can tell me what it was that happened<br/>
that was so funny.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had several people ask me why she isn&#39;t doing &quot;thus in such&quot; program or<br/>
why I&#39;m not pushing her and my response is, &quot;She only gets once to be a<br/>
child.  She has her whole life to learn things and decide what she is going<br/>
to do with it.&quot;  What would a 12 yo be able to do with a college degree?<br/>
I&#39;ve met a few of these children who have college degrees by age 10 or 12<br/>
and they seem so lost.  Here they are in a grown up world and they haven&#39;t<br/>
even hit puberty yet!  They have the information of the adult world, but<br/>
none of the true understanding of that world.  They have few peers because<br/>
they don&#39;t fit in anywhere.  When I was in high school there was an 8yo in<br/>
our senior class.  He was fodder for the bullies and ignored by advanced<br/>
placement students.  He didn&#39;t know how to interact with other kids.  If you<br/>
got him into a conversation it was always scholastic-natured.  If you asked<br/>
him what his favorite color was he would say it was irrelevant because there<br/>
was no way to preference colors.  He had no scientific data to support that<br/>
one color should or could be better than another.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, actually, HE did.  But also keep in mind, some kids have IQ&#39;s <br/>
in the upper 200&#39;s -- no joke -- and they are hungry for knowledge.  <br/>
There is an analogy that teaching gifted kids in regular classrooms <br/>
is like feeding an elephant one blade of grass at a time.  It will <br/>
starve to death without ever realizing you were feeding it.  There <br/>
really are self-driven kids.  Because you don&#39;t know them, doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean they don&#39;t exist.  If they are literally one (or less) in a <br/>
million -- how many millions of people do you know?  (And if you <br/>
know that many, when did you ever find time to count? :-))<br/>

a waste.  She finds this very sad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve had several people ask me why she isn&#39;t doing &quot;thus in such&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>program or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; why I&#39;m not pushing her and my response is, &quot;She only gets once to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>be a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; child.  She has her whole life to learn things and decide what she <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is going<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to do with it.&quot;  What would a 12 yo be able to do with a college <br/>
 </span></blockquote>degree?<br/>
<br/>
Actually, he wanted to go to grad school, but again, they made him <br/>
take a year off -- and he actually worked, freelancing.  Next year, <br/>
he is going to grad school, and they are allowing him to.  If they <br/>
held him back more, I suspect that he would resent it.  And -- btw, <br/>
they actually were unschoolers for quite a while, until he went to <br/>
college -- isn&#39;t unschooling about respecting your child&#39;s own <br/>
self?  Their desires in learning?  In life?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve met a few of these children who have college degrees by age <br/>
 </span></blockquote>10 or 12<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and they seem so lost.  Here they are in a grown up world and they <br/>
 </span></blockquote>haven&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; even hit puberty yet!  They have the information of the adult <br/>
 </span></blockquote>world, but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; none of the true understanding of that world.  They have few peers <br/>
 </span></blockquote>because<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they don&#39;t fit in anywhere.  When I was in high school there was <br/>
 </span></blockquote>an 8yo in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; our senior class.  He was fodder for the bullies and ignored by <br/>
 </span></blockquote>advanced<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; placement students.  He didn&#39;t know how to interact with other <br/>
 </span></blockquote>kids.  If you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; got him into a conversation it was always scholastic-natured.  If <br/>
 </span></blockquote>you asked<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; him what his favorite color was he would say it was irrelevant <br/>
 </span></blockquote>because there<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; was no way to preference colors.  He had no scientific data to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>support that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; one color should or could be better than another.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yet, he may well have been fodder for bullies in &quot;age appropriate&quot; <br/>
grades as well.  The fact that his conversation was always <br/>
scholastic makes me wonder if there was something else going on -- <br/>
aspergers or some such.  <br/>
<br/>
For every &quot;disaster&quot; grade-acceleration story, there are many more <br/>
successes, but administrators don&#39;t ever notice them.  Just like in <br/>
the paper, there are always lots of bad news stories, and few if any <br/>
positive ones.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, some kids really just don&#39;t fit in schools, no matter <br/>
what.  And what is right for one kid, isn&#39;t right for the next, even <br/>
if on paper their &quot;scores&quot; are the same.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, my son used to always have a different favorite color.  I used <br/>
to ask him what it was today -- could be blue, black, pink, silver, <br/>
gray,....  Now he says he doesn&#39;t really have a favorite color.  <br/>
Gotta love quirky kids!<br/>

 This is a joke on my older sister. Her dh was watching anime in<br/>
 Japanese one night while she was reading. He changed it over to<br/>
 English without her knowing and suddenly she was able to understand<br/>
 what they were saying! She sat up and said, &quot;I can understand<br/>
 Japanese!&quot; He nearly died laughing at her. He also told everyone<br/>
 he could think of...she is SO embarassed! We get threats when we<br/>
 mention it. (he he he)<br/>

  When we lived in Germany, a friend of mine was visiting. We were going <br/>
to a few weeks of dog shows and field trials. I translated <br/>
*constantly*---word by word for over a week. Listened to the Germans, <br/>
translated to English, listened for Elena&#39;s response, and translated to <br/>
German. Over and over and over.<br/>
<br/>
  Then someone walked up and started talking to me and Elena about a <br/>
certain dog. I continued to &quot;translate&quot; for her---word for word from <br/>
English to....English! &lt;G&gt; The German spoke English! I simply repeated <br/>
him word for word! Everyone cracked up, and Elena has gotten plenty of <br/>
mileage out of that! Kelly can translate ENGLISH! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;ll never live that down! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
