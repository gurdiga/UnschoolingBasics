<div id="ygrps-yiv-14261445">I watched that and the thing that I thought was among the more valuable points was that people who play games together, whether they win or lose, have better relationships. I thought about how important it is that I play with Simon and Linnaea and how valuable it is that they play with their friends, amongst others, via their xbox or the computer. I hadn&#39;t really thought about games as a facilitator, as a judgement tool, as a means of discovering how someone else responds to things and works with others, but it is and that totally leaped out at me from Jane McGonigal&#39;s talk. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That stood out for me, too. It&#39;s interesting to think about how gaming can influence relationships... that we like people better, that playing the game together builds trust.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a great gamer on the consoles as I&#39;m prone to motion sickness (Mario Karts = blergh), but my son is keen to try World of Warcraft (and Lego Universe, when it finally is released). I can play those sorts of games (as I once got *quite* involved in Kingdom of Loathing, for those who may know of it). And I will.<br/>
<br/>
In our family, as we relax out of our fear and shine the yes light around in our lives, gaming is becoming a more prominent feature in our day-to-day living. I want to embrace that to support my child&#39;s interests and this talk was so fantastically supportive of gaming that I felt another layer of my gut-clench-fear fall away.<br/>
<br/>
I also loved idea of the 10,000 hours of online games before the age of 21 and becoming virtuosos (reference to The Outliers). <br/>
<br/>
As a family, I feel we are heading for the Epic Win. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>
<br/>
Of the communities where I&#39;ve lived, there have been better relations in the group when there have been regular games - party games and card games for the most part. Its a qualitatively different way of connecting than via shared meals. Eating together is nice, and gives people a chance to connect on one level, but there&#39;s a separation in a meal situation between those who prepare the food and those who don&#39;t. Playing games together brings in the same sort of cameraderie that forms between people working together, in a way. <br/>

I am not a good game player but I try : )  and my family has really reaped the rewards of inclusiveness and tribal type bonding that came as a result of playing WOW together.  It has noticeably improved some rocky sibling relationships.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow! How cool is that! (And how did he land that gig?)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m truly excited for it to come out. I also think that we certainly need to add some WOW to our family.<br/>
