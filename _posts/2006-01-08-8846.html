Nip it or leave it are not your only choices. You could also give him,<br/>
without getting emotional, the accurate information that some of his<br/>
relatives might be offended by it, and that some people will make negative<br/>
judgments about him, and you as his parent, because of it. That there are<br/>
places where different styles of language are appropriate, and that<br/>
deliberately flouting convention can have consequences - so that his speech<br/>
is mindful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944962222">Yeah,I meant to mention that he only does this around the cousins or us.And I haven&#39;t <br/>
  commented on it at all.But since reading what you&#39;ve written I will mention the consequences <br/>
  of offending people if he should use this language around others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683622606">I don&#39;t know how old your son is but I think you would be doing him a favor by explaining how people may react to his choice of words.  I found that when I explained what the words meant and how that might be offensive, my children curbed their use to mostly appropriate situations rather than just flinging them out without much thought as to the audience.<br/>
<br/>
My 15yo daughter is a fairly traditional kid, a nice kid, not into bucking the system.  She went shopping with a friend and came home with a t-shirt that had a cactus on it and said &quot;Beware of pricks&quot;.  I didn&#39;t say anything about it but I was surprised because that just isn&#39;t her usual way of acting.  She spent the night with a friend and when she gets home, I realize that she wore that t-shirt to church and out to lunch with the friend&#39;s quite religious family.<br/>
<br/>
I pointed out to Adriane that she might want to be careful, that some people might be offended.  She looked at me funny and asked me what &quot;prick&quot; meant so I told her.  She was horrified and embarrassed...she had thought it meant something along the lines of a stupid person.<br/>

  I agree I had rather anyone say &quot;f*** You&quot; to another person than to call them stupid or refer to them <br/>
  as an idiot.<br/>
  And so far even though he thinks these 2 cousins are extremely cool he hasn&#39;t picked up on the <br/>
  bullying part.He is a very loving guy and wouldn&#39;t hurt a fly...literally will NOT see anyone hurt any<br/>
   living thing.<br/>
  Although his pdoc (he is bipolar) says that we can expect a huge change negatively at adolescence,I <br/>
  don&#39;t forsee it being as bad as say if he was in ps.I am so in love with unschooling I think it has become my religion&lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490426864">Thanks Julie,<br/>
  That reminds me of something along those same lines my ds did awhile back.There is a store in town named &quot;The cool store&quot; and he bought himself a T shirt there with the words &quot;what would Jesse do&quot; and a fist.He loves Jesse James and after spending the night and going to church with a neighbor I found out he wore the shirt to church.So I explained the &quot;what would Jesus do&quot; to him and that the Christians in the church may have been offended and he was also embarassed.He hadn&#39;t connected the two.<br/>
   <br/>
  My ds is 10 and since my original post I have explained all of this.He only does it when the &quot;cool cousins&#39; are here and has admitted that he was doing it because they had told him what a dork he was and how if he went to school he would learn how to not be such a dork.Grrrrrrrrr!<br/>
   <br/>
  But I think with all this cool info I will have a much easier time with it.<br/>
  Thanks Guys,<br/>
