<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315905491">Thanks for the suggestion of World Market..I love that place and we <br/>
don&#39;t have one here. <br/>
Unfortunately, after searching their site, I could only find these:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.worldmarket.com/catalog/product.jsp?">http://www.worldmarket.com/catalog/product.jsp?</a><br/>
productId=619&N=0&Nty=1&Ntx=mode%20matchallpartial&Ntt=metal%<br/>
20handle&Ntk=Cats<br/>
<br/>
I am so frustrated. I loved the teacups from that movie (House of Sand <br/>
and Fog) and can NOT find any for the life of me. I give. If anyone <br/>
has seen that movie and can buy some, I&#39;ll gladly send money for them <br/>
plus shipping!!<br/>
