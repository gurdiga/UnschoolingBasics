No, I don&#39;t see any need to know what the parts of a sentence are <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916962891">Hi grammar makes my hair rise off the back of my neck. back when my son was in the 2nd grade i was reading anywhere to three to five hours a night to my boys. that was before i started college. he had a paper to write, so i read it out loud to him, and he knew his tenses was off and added more to make the paper sound right to him. he got an A on that paper. and the teacher thought i wrote it. i still do that to my other sons when they need help on papers.<br/>
