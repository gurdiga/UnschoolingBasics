<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666115290">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Wanted to post about modeling behavior that we wish our children to emulate, for those who haven&#39;t experienced it yet.<br/>
<br/>
Our dd is just 28 mos, and I already KNOW this works. After she was born, I decided that I was not going to teach her the &quot;magic word&quot;, and never tell her to/insist she say &quot;please&quot; or &quot;thank you&quot;. Not because I don&#39;t care about other people, as it may look on the surface. But because I sat with the idea, and it just FELT right.<br/>
<br/>
She now spontaneously says &quot;please&quot;, &quot;thank you&quot;, and &quot;you&#39;re welcome&quot;, ONLY because it is how my husband and I interact with each other, other people, and her. She does not say it every single time yet, but to hear her say &quot;Oh! Thank you!&quot; when she is given a gift, or something to eat, or I help her adjust her chair or her shirt so it&#39;s more comfortable, is all the proof I need that modeling works.<br/>
<br/>
I can see why it is a difficult concept to grasp. I don&#39;t want to sound like I never had any doubts, because I did, but I followed my intuition. <br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Tracy A.<br/>
