<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930400070">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m hoping for some suggestions here.:-)<br/>
<br/>
My dd age 11 would like her own room, almost like a mini apartment. <br/>
Unfortunately we don&#39;t have the money for this right now and I&#39;m not <br/>
sure this is possible. <br/>
<br/>
She tends to be a loner and very much wants her own space and to get <br/>
away from the other kids. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on how I can meet her half-way? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks :-)</div>

<br/>
Can you give us more information? Does she have her own room right now<br/>
and just wants more items to make it her own space(like a mini-fridge)?<br/>
What kind of space do you have that could be converted? Like a closet<br/>
or storage space.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty creative with rooms, but let me know what you have right<br/>
now. Is she sharing a room with a sibling?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-815206598">A friend of mine has 3 kids in a small house. She got them loft beds then hung up curtains around the beds so they had their own &quot;room&quot; .<br/>
   <br/>
  A few years back we were in a 2 bedroom apt and had a couple and their kid plus our 2 little ones. My dh worked nights and was getting no sleep. We moved most of the stuff out of our walk in closet and put him an air matress . It blocked out the sound, he slept great and the kids were able to run around and be kids with no one stressing that he was being woken up. <br/>
   <br/>
  can a curtain be hung up across a room maybe? <br/>
   <br/>

Does she have her own room now? THAT would be the bigger problem---if <br/>
there is no room set aside just for her.<br/>
<br/>
But if she does, can you decorate it especially for her? Then could you <br/>
find one of those mini-refrigerators and mini-microwaves that are <br/>
selling like hotcakes right now? You know, for dorm rooms?<br/>
<br/>
Make her a tiny kitchen in a corner (with a tiny ice-cream table and <br/>
two chairs) so that she can prepare her own meals?---or at least dine <br/>
alone occasionally or reheat something.<br/>
<br/>
Get a cheap/free tv all her own, for her own den. To make a more <br/>
apartment-like feel, a day bed, which takes up less space AND can <br/>
double as a sofa during the day would give her a good look.<br/>
<br/>
ALL of these things are available through free-cycle and at thrift <br/>
stores.<br/>

A curtain to hang up as a divider, or Chinese screens, that kind of  <br/>
thing...but a sheet that she dyed or decorated might be really nice. I&#39;m sensing  <br/>
puberty and a need for privacy, which often go hand in hand. Even hanging beads  <br/>
might be a good division line - kind of a private space within the public area  <br/>
of a shared room...<br/>
