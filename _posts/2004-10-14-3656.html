But I think a parent who teaches a child that it doesnt matter if you<br/>
can&#39;t spell is doing them a dis-service. It does matter. Nor do I<br/>
think that spelling lessons per se are the answer necessarily. At the<br/>
moment the spelling coaching I am giving my daughter involves<br/>
self-conficence because I have noticed that her misspellings usually<br/>
involve the last couple of syllables of long words. <br/>

I find it fascinating that you have such a strong feeling about unschooling <br/>
parents &#39;using incorrect spelling and grammar&#39; on these lists, while you <br/>
yourself have misspelled words and used incorrect grammar in nearly every single one <br/>
of _your_ replies in this thread!<br/>
<br/>
In this post alone, it&#39;s &#39;doesn&#39;t,&#39; &#39;disservice,&#39; and self-confidence.  You <br/>
sure seem very judgmental of others for something you&#39;re awfully guilty of <br/>
yourself.  How ever are YOU being a good role model for YOUR children? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
