<div id="ygrps-yiv-920516476">Hello everyone, is this a group to get helpful advice??? If so I need some help. I&#39;m thinking about unschooling my 2 boys ages 14 & 16. I&#39;ve never tried this before. We have used Abeka, Bob Jones, made my own curriculum, & now using Switched on Schoolhouse. I have heard that unschooling is where you just let them learn what they want to learn, is this correct? If so how do you get 2 teen boys to learn when they are not going to choose to learn anything unless they are made. How do you teach them math or english? They ask me all the time why do they have to learn the things that Switched on Schoolhouse is trying to teach them when they don&#39;t see they are ever going to use it in life, especially the History lessons. This is just a few questions I&#39;m concerned with.  Any help would be greatful, Cynthia<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re interested in unschooling, I suggest reading some of the <br/>
older posts on this list. You&#39;ll find a lot of information. <br/>
May I also suggest <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.info/">http://www.unschooling.info/</a><br/>
Take some time and let it sink in. <br/>
I think the first step, at least for me, was changing my way of <br/>
thinking.    <br/>

<br/>
Why should they need to learn things that don&#39;t interest them?  If <br/>
they memorize the stuff for the sake of passing a test, it will be <br/>
forgotten soon after.  Anything that matters to them will stick.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;How do you teach them math or english? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t teach them.  They learn it just by being awake, reading, <br/>
talking to people, watching TV.  I&#39;d be willing to guess they speak <br/>
and understand the language pretty well at this point.  I&#39;d also be <br/>
willing to guess they know enough math to balance a checkbook and <br/>
take care of other daily tasks that adults deal with.  If they <br/>
should develop an interest in rocket science and decide to pursue <br/>
that, they&#39;ll be exposed to, and learn, very high level math by <br/>
virtue of the need to use it in their exploration of that.  If they <br/>
like building things, they&#39;ll use geometry without necessarily <br/>
labeling it as such.  Anything they need to learn or know to <br/>
function and pursue their true interests will come into play.  If <br/>
they have no interest in anything requiring more than the ability to <br/>
count their money, they really don&#39;t need to learn it, do they?  Do <br/>
you sit around writing up geometric proofs in your daily life?  I <br/>
don&#39;t!  :)<br/>
<br/>

they are ever going to use it in life, especially the History <br/>
lessons. <br/>
<br/>
I hated history too until I got the History channel and read some <br/>
really well-written books that included history as part of the <br/>
story.  I remember those things I picked up there, but not the stuff <br/>
I had to memorize in school.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about learning what interests you, and remembering same.  You <br/>
don&#39;t need to memorize a bunch of stuff that doesn&#39;t apply to you.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure others will respond to this much better than I did.  :)<br/>

<br/>
A great book on this is &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me&quot; (also available as a<br/>
book-on-tape lecture series), a very interesting critique of the teaching of<br/>
History in school, and of history text books. It includes a lot of<br/>
fascinating, and very new to me as a non-American, history by way of<br/>
illustrating the negatives of the teaching and the political agendas behind<br/>
text book writing.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that the author notes is just how much real and vivid<br/>
depictions of history, a vibrant branch of study at higher levels of<br/>
academia than high school, are enjoyed and sought after by adults. The<br/>
History Channel and all kinds of historical dramas are so hugely popular.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t like history in school either - why? Because I could never get a<br/>
handle on what the assessors wanted in our essays. I could write an English<br/>
or art history essay to get 90&#39;s, but my results in history were less good.<br/>
Now that there is no test to pass, I am freed to truly enjoy it. It is a<br/>
huge collection of topics really, not just one homogenous subject.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362420381">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; If so how do you get 2 teen boys to learn when they are not going to<br/>
choose to learn anything unless they are made. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the first steps is to do some reading on the nature of real learning.<br/>
I suggest Frank Smith &quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting&quot;, maybe Daniel<br/>
Pink &quot;Free Agent Nation&quot;, John Holt anything and, especially as your kids<br/>
are teens, &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that when you write &quot;learn anything&quot; what you mean is &quot;learn<br/>
certain overtly academic stuff that I approve of and is at least<br/>
commensurate with, if not surpassing, the standards of the public schools in<br/>
my State&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that when you write &quot;not going to choose to learn anything&quot; you<br/>
may mean not choose to &quot;memorize to the tests at the end of the chapter&quot; or<br/>
&quot;be able to recite information to my satisfaction&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Please head on over to www.sandradodd.com/unschooling and read there. Also<br/>
follow the link to Joyce Fetterol&#39;s beautiful site.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;How do you teach them math or english? They ask me &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well if they are speaking to you I guess they are a long way forward on<br/>
learning English....seriously one of the big parts of Unschooling is<br/>
focusing on what is great about our kids, what they are doing and achieving<br/>
for themselves, rejoicing in their unique brilliances, supporting their<br/>
definitions of success and aspirations - not seeing their educational<br/>
&quot;deficits&quot; in terms of subjects that need your attention to redress.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of reading. Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Cynthia,<br/>
Go to www.unschooling.com and click on the side bar that says &quot;articles <br/>
and essays.&quot;  There is some very enlightening reading material there <br/>
that will help you to understand what &quot;unschooling&quot; is to everyday life <br/>
circumstances.  Sandra Dodd also has a website with tons of great stuff <br/>
on it.  Just google &quot;understanding unschooling&quot; and you will get a <br/>
treasure-trove of hits.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, except that the learning looks different than it does when  <br/>
they&#39;re doing school.<br/>
<br/>
In a way it looks like weekends and summer vacation except without  <br/>
the avoiding things that look like something they might be made to do  <br/>
in school ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If so how do you get 2 teen boys to learn when they are not going  <br/>
&gt; to choose to learn anything unless they are made.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you were to start right now, yes, they will avoid learning  <br/>
anything that, to them, reminds them of something they would be made  <br/>
to learn.<br/>
<br/>
First they would need to deschool (or deprogram as someone recently  <br/>
called it.)<br/>
<br/>
They would need to gain confidence that they won&#39;t be made to learn  <br/>
something they don&#39;t want to, and gain confidence that if they do  <br/>
pick up something that might be learned in school that they can do so  <br/>
without anyone commenting or  breathing a sigh of relief ;-) and they  <br/>
can put it down also without comment or tension.<br/>
<br/>
They would need time to catch up on all the living they&#39;ve had to set  <br/>
aside for school work. Imagine if someone made you spend your time  <br/>
doing things you felt were pointless and only let you read for 10  <br/>
minutes a week (or something else you love). And then they removed  <br/>
all restrictions and you could do whatever you wanted. It would take  <br/>
a long time to get your fill of reading :-)<br/>
<br/>
They also need time for things that are taught in school to loose  <br/>
that patina of boring that school (and school work) paints them with.  <br/>
They need time to discover those same things within and through  <br/>
things they already love.<br/>
<br/>
Rule of thumb is 1 month for each year they&#39;ve been schooled.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you teach them math or english?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t. They learn by using it.<br/>
<br/>
How did they learn to talk? Did you teach them? All they did was live  <br/>
life and use English as a tool to get what they wanted. Saying &quot;Ook&quot;  <br/>
for milk worked better than crying. :-) And they get better at it as  <br/>
a side effect of using it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They ask me all the time why do they have to learn the things that  <br/>
&gt; Switched on Schoolhouse is trying to teach them when they don&#39;t see  <br/>
&gt; they are ever going to use it in life, especially the History  <br/>
&gt; lessons. This is just a few questions I&#39;m concerned with.  Any help  <br/>
&gt; would be greatful, Cynthia<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And parents and teachers have been lying to kids for *years* trying  <br/>
to convince them that it&#39;s because they&#39;ll need it in the future even  <br/>
if they can&#39;t see that now.<br/>
<br/>
If you honestly look back and think of all the things you learned  <br/>
that you&#39;ve never had to use, you can see how big of a lie that is.  <br/>
What you *do* need are the things that you use. And you get better at  <br/>
them, again, as a side effect of using them.<br/>
<br/>
No one needs to learn to be a gourmet cook in order to start cooking.  <br/>
You just start and make mistakes and learn what you need as you need  <br/>
it. Same with everything. :-)<br/>
<br/>
How do boys (usually! ;-) learn to work on cars? By messing around  <br/>
with them. By reading about them. By talking to other people about  <br/>
them. No one needs to make them learn. They keep pulling themself  <br/>
along through new territory because it&#39;s interesting. They learn new  <br/>
things because they&#39;re interesting and they need something to  <br/>
understand something even more interesting. It&#39;s like building a  <br/>
foundation beneath you as you go along and then you look down and  <br/>
you&#39;re ten stories up in the air without realizing how you got there :-)<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling is much more than just stopping school. It takes  <br/>
being your child&#39;s partner in helping *them* get where *they* want to  <br/>
go, do what *they* want to do. It takes parents being interested in  <br/>
life just because they think it&#39;s interesting.<br/>

The learning won&#39;t look like schoolwork but that&#39;s okay. Schoolwork is irrelevant outside of school. We surround our children with an interesting, supportive, engaging life and help them pursue their interests wherever they lead. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  Hello everyone, is this a group to get helpful advice???<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
We like to think so.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 If so I need some <br/>
help. I&#39;m thinking about unschooling my 2 boys ages 14 & 16. I&#39;ve never tried <br/>
this before. We have used Abeka, Bob Jones, made my own curriculum, & now using <br/>
Switched on Schoolhouse. I have heard that unschooling is where you just let <br/>
them learn what they want to learn, is this correct?<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
You might want to do some side reading along with this list. Most of these books are in your library:<br/>
Frank Smith&#39;s _The Book of Learning and Forgetting_<br/>
John Taylor Gatto&#39;s _Dumbing Us Down_ and _The Underground History of American Education_<br/>
Daniel Pink&#39;s _Free Agent Nation_<br/>
Grace Llewellyn&#39;s _The Teenage Liberation Handbook_<br/>
Mary Griffith&#39;s _The Unschooling Handbook_<br/>
All books by John Holt, the father of unschooling (I suggest reading them all, in order, so you can watch<br/>
him leave school reform and start touting unschooling. Others say just _Learning All the Time_)<br/>
 <br/>
These books are new and probably NOT in your library---all are available from the authors---just google:<br/>
Valerie Fitzenreiter&#39;s _The Unprocessed Child_ Sandra Dodd&#39;s _Moving a Puddle and Other Essays_ And my favorite, Rue Kream&#39;s _Parenting a Free Child, an Unschooled Life_  There are two magazines: _Life Learning_ and _Live Free Learn Free_ both devoted to unschooling.  Websites: www.SandraDodd.com   www.borntoexplore.com     Joyce&#39;s (Sorry---I don&#39;t know that one by heart---help?!)-=-=-=-<br/>
 If so how do you get 2 teen boys to learn when they are not going to choose to learn anything unless they <br/>
are made.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
You first change your thinking! Teenage boys naturally LOVE to learn. Unfortunately, Bob Jones and ABeka <br/>
can turn even the most avid learner against learning ANYTHING! They need time to heal--to deschool or <br/>
deprogram from all that drivel. What are their passions?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 How do you teach them math or english?<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
By living a life full of both. You &quot;teach&quot; by example---by modelling the behavior you&#39;d like to see. Are <br/>
YOU interested in math and english? Do you get into fractions and percentages? Do you talk about adverbs <br/>
and noun clauses. Not unless you need/want to is my guess. They&#39;re no different.<br/>
 <br/>
Mostly I think they already KNOW english! They probably already know most of the math they&#39;ll ever need. <br/>
 <br/>
Do you think they need to know *everything* before they&#39;re 18? Did *you*?<br/>
 <br/>
They have their whole lives ahead of them! Real learners never stop learning! Unless forced to learn---<br/>
THAT&#39;s a real turn-off! <br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 They ask me all the time why do <br/>
they have to learn the things that Switched on Schoolhouse is trying to teach <br/>
them when they don&#39;t see they are ever going to use it in life, especially the <br/>
History lessons. <br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Smart boys!<br/>
 <br/>
You may find that they already have a passion for a certain time in history (my 17 year old is really <br/>
into the &#39;60s and 70&#39;s right now (wow---my life as history! &lt;g&gt;), it just may not be Elizabethan England <br/>
or The Russian Revolution. History&#39;s a BIG subject. They&#39;ll find parts of it when they&#39;re ready. History <br/>
of art or weapons or cultures or war or fashion or architecture---it&#39;s ALL related, really!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling IS about letting them learn what they want to learn. But it&#39;s MUCH more than that. It&#39;s also <br/>
about respecting them and their choices and trusting that they are learning creatures who are naturally <br/>
curious about their world. It&#39;s about not forcing them to learn what isn&#39;t interesting to them *now*. It&#39;s <br/>
about believeing that they *will* learn in time all they&#39;ll need to know.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s harder than it sounds! &lt;G&gt; Because, as parents, it means challenging ourselves every day to trust, <br/>
respect, and believe in our children to a higher degree than other parents. It&#39;s so simple when you <br/>
finally understand it, but it takes a while to get there! You NEED to trust them---and that&#39;s not something <br/>
our culture/society likes! It&#39;s going against the mainstream. Unschooling&#39;s not for every parent. Every <br/>
CHILD can THRIVE---but it&#39;s a hurdle for most parents!<br/>
 <br/>
Any other questions? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cynthia, have you read any of the articles at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling</a> ?  There are quite a few<br/>
articles there about how people learn math and English without having<br/>
a lesson plan.  Every unschooling family is going to look different.<br/>
There is no &quot;lesson plan&quot; or &quot;checklist&quot; to unschooling.  The first<br/>
thing I would do is to deschool.  Some children will deschool quickly<br/>
while other children will take months or years to get to a point where<br/>
they can trust that you aren&#39;t going to &quot;go back to the old way.&quot;  You<br/>
and any other adults in your house are also going to have to deschool<br/>
yourselves.  You&#39;ve most likely had 12+ years of schooling yourself<br/>
and you have to get rid of that schoolishness, too.  I would also look<br/>
at some unschooling books and see what &quot;the experts&quot; have to say.<br/>
There is no blueprint.  Start finding ways to say yes more and no less<br/>
and help your children discover their passions while you work to<br/>
discover your passions at the same time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-558878963">Hello Cynthia,<br/>
<br/>
well lesson plan... unschooling is about *not* having them. But there  <br/>
are still some helpful texts to get you started:<br/>
<br/>
I find this very helpful: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Efetteroll/">http://home.earthlink.net/%7Efetteroll/</a> <br/>
rejoycing/ (Joyce Fetteroll)<br/>
<br/>
(it&#39;s a loooot to read though and quite overwhelming!)<br/>
<br/>
Then there is Scott, for changing they way you look at your  <br/>
children :-) In the &quot;Title list&quot; you find all the articles, and if  <br/>
you open them from bottom to top, you can kind of do the &quot;lessons&quot;  <br/>
one by one. He often says in a post &quot;Today, do xxx...&quot; But this is  <br/>
more for YOU, I think. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.enjoyparenting.com/">http://www.enjoyparenting.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
There is Sandra: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/">http://sandradodd.com/</a> even more to read! (but to  <br/>
start I&#39;d try Joyce Fetteroll :-))<br/>
<br/>
And this: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strewing">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a> might be quite helpful to  <br/>
understand unschooling<br/>
<br/>
and Ren: learninginfreedom.com, describing the &quot;stages&quot; of  <br/>
unschooling :-)<br/>
<br/>
And what people have been told me here is to not say &quot;we&#39;re  <br/>
unschooling now, there are no limits, no bedtimes, you are free to do  <br/>
whatever you want&quot;, cause that causes chaos :-) Start saying &quot;yes&quot; a  <br/>
lot more (Joyce describes how you can do this even though you  <br/>
actually want to say no, there are different kinds of yeses :-)...  <br/>
and you&#39;ll see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 7 and she got it pretty quickly that something had  <br/>
changed and so we had a little chaos for a few days, but now it&#39;s  <br/>
already great!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all, by the way - again :-)<br/>
<br/>
greetings<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947889536">Here&#39;s your lesson plan to start.<br/>
Wake up early. (or not.)<br/>
Have some breakfast (or not)<br/>
Take a walk (or not)<br/>
Watch TV (or not)<br/>
Play a board game (or not)<br/>
Do the breakfast dishes(or not)<br/>
head out to a park(or not)<br/>
Swing by the consignment shop(or not)<br/>
Stop at the new Thai place for some lemon grass soup(or not)<br/>
head home to make your own lemon grass soup(or not)<br/>
Try some fresh figs at the local farmers market while picking up lemon grass(or not)<br/>
Head home to google lemon grass soup and raising your own figs(or not)<br/>
Watch Black Beauty(or not)<br/>
realize that you&#39;ve read this recently and search the house for the book(or not)<br/>
help little one read the words on his Pokemon video game for the Fifty-eleventh time.(or not)<br/>
Kvetch about the rain to no one in particular(or not)<br/>
Decide to splash in the puddles(or not).<br/>
<br/>
Beginning to move away from school is like the first day of summer break. Relax, have fun. Look at the world with eyes open to all the possibilities that are out there. What is out there is not &quot;Math&quot; or &quot;Social Studies&quot;. What&#39;s out there IS numbers and time and distance and making more or less. It&#39;s interacting with people, exploring the neighborhood, chatting about the person running for county commisioner and does she really want &quot;open space&quot; and what does that mean? Does that mean helping the farmers to maintain their livelihoods or does it mean a new development of not less than 5 acres per parcel?<br/>
Life. your children and you are ready to live life, not live school.<br/>
For the next few months just Be. Explore, look for Joy. stay curious. Find things that interest you such as knitting, cooking, reading junk books, watching the entire run of Friends, starting a BeeHive, grab your old guitar and head to a local Open Mike night,  bake a loaf of bread, whatever.<br/>
Do things with your kids, Do some things without your kids. Find your own passions. Dabble.<br/>
Most of all, read here:<br/>
www.sandradodd.com<br/>
and here:<br/>
www.unschooling.info<br/>
and here:<br/>

Have a wonderful time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371092398">Wow Elissa & Johanna, you really know how to put it. I think you broke down unschooling in a marvelous way. I have been homeschooling for many years now and spoke to several people last year about unschooling but I just couldn&#39;t understand how they would do math or Grammar/Language. We kind of done school similiar to unschooling last year. I guess we formally homeschooled for about 4 months last year using S.O.S and it was too tedious for the boys so we unschooled for the remainder of the year. I was scared because I kept wondering what can they possibly be learning. Both boys want to hunt, fish, ride 4 wheelers, drive the jeep in the pasture, & talk on the phone. They do not like video games or t.v. very much. The youngest likes working on things that has wheels...because he likes to drive. Oh, they both have full time jobs also. They work with a friend of our in a scrap yard doing odds and ends. Everyone around here knows they homeschool so if little odd jobs need to be<br/>
 done they call on the boys. After they have worked a long, hot or cold day they want to come home and do their own thing, not schoolwork. Thanks to both of you for the wonderful sites. I&#39;ll be reading, searching & looking for ways to have a fun unschooling time. Is anyone in the group close to the North Alabama area, including the tri-states?<br/>
  Blessings, Cynthia<br/>
