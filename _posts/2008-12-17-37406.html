<div id="ygrps-yiv-451755224">Hi Carol,<br/>
<br/>
We are adoptive parents but not adopted from China. Our two boys are from Vladivostok Russia, which isn&#39;t actually far from the Chinese border. We adopted them in 2006 and they are now 4 and 5 years old. I homeschool/unschool... sort of eclectic depending on the area. I know that makes no sense, but any how if you want to chat I&#39;m here!<br/>

My mom and dad have adopted twice from China and will be travelling <br/>
probably in February to China to complete their third adoption. They <br/>
have 4 bio kids (I&#39;m number 3, and am 26 years old) and will now have 7 <br/>
children total. My little sisters are 5 and 5 (they are 5 months apart, <br/>
one has been home since 07/05 and the other is awaiting adoption) and <br/>
my little brother is 4 (he&#39;s 11 months younger than my oldest little <br/>
sister and has been home since 12/06). My parents live north of <br/>
Cincinnati about 20 miles. They homeschooled my younger bio sis and I <br/>
for a while (my last three years of school and my sisters last years as <br/>
well). I unschool my 3 children (ages 7, 4, and 4) and my parents are <br/>
comtemplating pulling their children from pre-school/ kindergarten to <br/>
homeschool, though I&#39;m not sure that she will be taking <br/>
an &#39;unschooling&#39; approach. My mother is, however, very supportive of my <br/>
choice to unschool my children, and will stand up for me and my choice <br/>
to anyone, including my sister-in-law (a public school teacher who has <br/>
actually told me I&#39;m doing an injustice to my children by unschooling <br/>
them!). <br/>
If you&#39;d like their contact info, please email me off-list. My mom <br/>
loves to meet other adoptive families in the area and I&#39;m sure would <br/>
love to meet an adoptive/ homeschooling family!<br/>
