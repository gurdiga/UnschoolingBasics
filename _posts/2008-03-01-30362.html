<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364969081">The following is an e-mail that I sent to a local unschooling friend<br/>
who unschools her 2 children.I think it is probably the first truly<br/>
honest correspondence I have written about how I am feeling about<br/>
unschooling Sophia who will be 6 in a week.<br/>
<br/>
----------------<br/>
Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Meg (16) has changed her mind about graduating in May so  I am free to<br/>
go to LIG. If you are still interested in carpooling there let me<br/>
know. I could really really really use some inspiration at this point<br/>
to keep unschooling Sophia.<br/>
<br/>
I am having a very rough time right now and keep thinking about taking<br/>
the easy way out and putting Soph  in school, but I know that that is<br/>
not the answer. I have learned over the years not to make any life<br/>
changing decisions at this time of year since I get a little crazy and<br/>
restless with spring fever.<br/>
<br/>
I did register her for the after school program at the (local<br/>
community center) since it is totally up to us when and how long she<br/>
goes and I can get some much needed alone time (without having to be<br/>
scrutinized by G-ma&#39;s). The after kindergarten program runs from 11:30<br/>
to 6:30 so there is quite a lot of time for me to be alone and make<br/>
some music or just stare blankly at a wall. Just thinking about about<br/>
being away from Sophia makes me feel guilty, what the heck is wrong<br/>
with me????????<br/>
<br/>
I also feel over run and trapped by the dogs (why did I get another<br/>
puppy???). I am very limited in how long I can be away and I am not<br/>
liking that at all right now.<br/>
<br/>
AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Rachel <br/>
------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I am looking for advice or just some words of<br/>
encouragement, or for someone to ask me the not so easy questions to<br/>
ask, or for someone to just kick me in the butt with the brutally<br/>
honest words telling me to suck it up. But what I do need is support<br/>
to keep unschooling Sophia which in my heart I know is the best thing<br/>
I could do for her.<br/>
<br/>
By the way we have 4 cats and 2 dogs who seem to run the house and<br/>
disturb our sleep, the house is a wreck (I would not let my sister who<br/>
was visiting from out of state come over because of the mess, she<br/>
works for Head-start).<br/>
<br/>
Another of my sisters for some reason insists that I am a pot smoker<br/>
(which I am not) and tells people so. I don&#39;t have a problem with pot<br/>
smoking, it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t do it and don&#39;t want to give any more<br/>
reason for people to think I am &quot;off my rocker&quot; than I am truly<br/>
entitled to. <br/>
<br/>
Add to that, we are very much in debt and going deeper every month<br/>
which makes going back to work very appealing. <br/>
<br/>
There is more to this situation but I have to go and if I don&#39;t send<br/>
this now, it will get deleted later.<br/>
<br/>
Help me sort this out so I can enjoy my girls instead of dreading<br/>
being a mom.</div>

you mentioned in another paragraph that you need alone time.  Most of <br/>
the posts I see from new unschoolers are trying to get over the <br/>
schoolish stuff, i.e. letting go of traditional schooling ideas to let <br/>
their child be free.  You seem to be trying to decide whether to <br/>
homeschool or not.  I would suggest you decide how much alone time you <br/>
need and why.  Maybe there is another way to get what you need without <br/>
putting Sophia in school.  Just something to ponder.<br/>

were much more stressful when my oldest spend 1.5 yrs in public<br/>
school.  I also have that same rule for February.  It&#39;s my hardest<br/>
month.  :-(<br/>

where I was over my head.  i had to make a really hard decision.  I<br/>
had to rehome my dog 3 years ago.  I was lucky in that my father<br/>
really wanted to take her.  But my point is, your life and your<br/>
children&#39;s life is more important.  And if your dog&#39;s are making your<br/>
life miserable, then maybe the dog&#39;s aren&#39;t all that happy either.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-561813498">Is her being home really the problem? If you take away the debt, the <br/>
mess, the pets etc, what exactly is left? Sometimes it helps to peel <br/>
back layers one at a time to find the real root of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned this time of year. Seasonal depression is SO very <br/>
common. Do you think that may be contributing? If so there are some <br/>
natural things you can do like take a B Complex vitamin, drink plenty <br/>
of green tea, sit in a sunny window (if its too cold to sit outside) <br/>
for Vitamin D. If you need more ideas along this line, email me, I <br/>

Would finding a permanent or temporary residence for the animals <br/>
help? If everything is as bad as you feel it is, are they being <br/>
neglected? I know when my dogs are neglected they get out of control <br/>
and have indoor accidents. You have a lot of pets, so maybe just <br/>
finding friends who can take some of them? Or maybe getting outside <br/>

That&#39;s not cool and I would confront her on this. Ask her why she <br/>
feels she needs to sabotage you like this. Mybe she is <br/>
misinterpretting your lack of motivation from stress as laziness from <br/>
pot? If it persists, I&#39;d cut contact rather than let someone poison <br/>
my life like that. I know neither is an easy solution, but just some <br/>

Debt is tough. But will you make enough going back to work to bring <br/>
home anything substantial? Can you get a part-time job in the evening <br/>
when your spouse is home so you can be with Sophia during the day but <br/>
also give yourself some free time? Maybe cutting expenses will help <br/>
with the debt or even having a yard sale? Cleaning out old stuff may <br/>
help you feel better - I always feel mentally clearer after I purge <br/>
and organize.<br/>

Have you asked yourself exactly what you don&#39;t enjoy? Are there <br/>
expectations or other things you are having a hard time letting go <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I want to have her home with me. AND she overwhelms me. I don&#39;t like<br/>
to use labels but, for lack of a better way to describe, she is  a<br/>
high need kid. It has felt like a whirlwind since she was born almost<br/>
six years ago. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh sunshine, wonderful sunshine, how I long for it. Yep. Not only<br/>
seasonal depression but also more. 2 years ago I had a melt down and<br/>
was put on meds for depression and anxiety. I am weaning off those<br/>
meds now and it makes it rough. I have been off of one of the<br/>
medications for a year but the other one is one of the hardest to come<br/>
off of because of the severe physical with drawls. I have been<br/>
decreasing the dose slowly under Dr.&#39;s supervision. I am down from 150<br/>
mg a day to now only 25mg a day.<br/>
<br/>
I do take a B Complex as well as other suppliments and it does help. I<br/>
would love to hear more ideas on feeling better naturally.<br/>

&gt;them would help you feel better and its something you and Sophia can<br/>
&gt;do together.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I bought a 2nd dog crate today so that both dogs can be crated at<br/>
night (no more cats being chased at night) and when necessary during<br/>
the day. I also got a cat door that can be put in a basement window so<br/>
that the cats can let themselves in and out (I can&#39;t count how many<br/>
times a day I open doors for cats) without having to be harassed by<br/>
the dogs when they come upstairs for me to let them out. I&#39;ll see if<br/>
DH can help me install it tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
I think my words made it sound like my house is worse than it is. The<br/>
cats boxes are cleaned twice a day and Zoe (an almost 2 yo Australian<br/>
shepherd) is totally house broken. Clarabelle (Border Collie/Blue<br/>
Heeler) is only 12 weeks old and is still learning about going outside<br/>
so she does have accidents but they are cleaned up right away.<br/>
<br/>
The dogs however have not gotten the exercise and attention that they<br/>
need to behave like nice polite doggies. They are jumping on people<br/>
and wrestling through the living room. They need to be walked and<br/>
trained more.<br/>
<br/>
The mess in my house is mostly people mess. Piles of books, papers,<br/>
dh&#39;s gaming and art stuff, my music stuff, unschooling a 5 year stuff<br/>
(markers, paper, inventions, etc.), laundry, dishes. But it is not<br/>
guest friendly in my eyes.<br/>

at this point in time. I&#39;ll have to really think about exactly what it<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832342382">Those dog breeds are very high energy breeds and need a lot of exercise and training. Just letting them out in the yard or play ball is not enough. They need at least 0ne hour of walking with training everyday because they are working dogs. Unless they lived in a farm you need to provide this everyday. That is why I am putting off getting another Heeler and I live in a Dairy Farm. I have also worked with dogs for 30 years now.<br/>
  If you can&#39;t provide that then those dogs are not getting what they need.<br/>
  You are better of saving that energy towards your dd.<br/>
  And like someone else said taking your dd to school maybe for work then having her home.<br/>

<br/>
Those dog breeds are very high energy breeds and need a lot of exercise <br/>
and<br/>
training. Just letting them out in the yard or play ball is not enough. <br/>
They<br/>
need at least 0ne hour of walking with training everyday because they <br/>
are<br/>
working dogs. Unless they lived in a farm you need to provide this <br/>
everyday.<br/>
That is why I am putting off getting another Heeler and I live in a <br/>
Dairy Farm.<br/>
I have also worked with dogs for 30 years now.<br/>
   If you can&#39;t provide that then those dogs are not getting what they <br/>
need.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
A more sedate breed would be a better choice for a more sedate family. <br/>
High energy breeds NEED an active lifestyle, or they can make your life <br/>
miserable.<br/>
<br/>
And an older dog, not a puppy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044301479">I understand. It is hard but it may be better for both your family and the dogs. I am of the opinion that once you get a dog you should commit, better yet, research that breed&#39;s needs then commit and get  a dog. <br/>
  Once in a while walking is not enough for those breeds, really.<br/>
  I agree with Kelly on getting an older and more laid back breed. <br/>
The shelters are full of those dogs.<br/>
  I once had a miniature schnauzer that was also a champion and stud dog that I placed with some breeders. I had gotten into Law School and had no time for the animal. He was being neglected by me and it was not fair to him. He went to this wonderful home where he lived very happy. I would visit him but I could see he was much better there than with me at the time. I was a good decision. <br/>
  He needed lots of grooming to keep his show coat and he loved attention. He was a sweet heart and deserved better than a couple of 10 minutes walk a day. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844135410">***The after kindergarten program runs from 11:30<br/>
to 6:30 so there is quite a lot of time for me to be alone and make<br/>
some music or just stare blankly at a wall.***<br/>
<br/>
Are you thinking of putting her in the program for seven hours?   How many days a week?  That&#39;s a mistake if you want to unschool.   Maybe the problem is you want to say you&#39;re an unschooler for some reason for yourself but you haven&#39;t giving enough thought to what it means for your daughter.  You won&#39;t create an interesting home life for her if you make excuses why she can&#39;t be home.   If you ever hope to be dedicated to unschooling, sending her out to programs, by herself, while you stare at walls, will not get you there.  <br/>
<br/>
***Just thinking about about<br/>
being away from Sophia makes me feel guilty, what the heck is wrong<br/>
with me????????***<br/>
<br/>
It SHOULD bother you to be away from her.  She&#39;s six.  Your her mom.   Maybe I misunderstood what you meant here but it looks like you suspect there&#39;s something wrong with you because you feel guilty about ditching your kid.    The problem is not your guilt.  The problem is the thing that&#39;s urging you to put her in a program.   <br/>
<br/>
***I also feel over run and trapped by the dogs (why did I get another<br/>
puppy???).***<br/>
<br/>
Why *did* you get a puppy?   <br/>
<br/>
Are you in the habit of acting before you&#39;ve thought a thing through?  Did you decide to unschool in the same way you decided to get a puppy? <br/>
<br/>
You might deepen your understanding of unschooling, or decide against it, if you were to read a lot about unschooling and write (not necessarily to anyone, but writing for yourself) about what your hopes are for your child and what your goals are as a mother.  Lots of understanding can happen through writing.  It may be that your thoughts, understanding and dedication to unschooling are superficial and more research will help you decide one way or another. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not trapped.  Of the other beings you&#39;ve mentioned in your post, you are the only one with the power and legal right to make your circumstances different.  You can pack a bag and leave in the next ten minutes and never come back, but your child can&#39;t change her life without you&#39;re help and the puppy can&#39;t make his/her life better without your help.    You have all the power and you&#39;re writing like you&#39;re the powerless one in this situation.  <br/>
<br/>
Find a neighborhood kid to come walk the dogs two or three times a day.  Pay the kid to do that for you.  It will be liberating for you and a kindness to your puppy and a good thing for the kid. Everybody wins.    Or *better yet*, get out and walk the dogs yourself, with your daughter, and explore your neighborhood and town, and delight in your puppy.   The exercise will help your mental state and the walk will be a nice way to spend time with your kid and your puppy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not fond of advice to get rid of animals if they&#39;re taking up some of your time.  Like children we owe them our responsible dedication.  If you made a hasty decision in getting a puppy, well, that&#39;s a bummer, but the puppy still needs a responsible person to care for him/her.  You can choose to enjoy the complications of life with a puppy.  We ALL have to find ways to figure out how to live in our lives.  It&#39;s not unique to you that there are details to take care of and problems to solve and new things to get used to every day.  That&#39;s what life is and the sooner you can embrace your own wonderful human adaptability the happier you will be.&lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
When my husband and I were moving from Alaska to Montana with a new baby, a dog, four cats and a rabbit, my sister in law said &quot;Why not leave the animals there, it will be easier.&quot;   I forgave her because she was obviously INSANE, but it did help me see that &quot;Easy&quot; wasn&#39;t what I wanted.  I wanted a move that caused the least possible stress to my family and my family included my critters.  Easy for me was not my goal, but I had become stressed with the work of moving and lost track of what my real goal was.  I had been focusing on myself when what I needed was to focus on the goal.   <br/>
<br/>
Puppyless, is not the goal.  Kidless is not the goal.  The goal is happiness and it can be achieved more perfectly with a puppy and a kid.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Get up a couple hours before your kid in the morning so you can have some quiet time, or stay up a couple hours later than she does.    The single most effective thing I&#39;ve ever found for improving mental health is exercise.  Get lots, even if you jump rope in your bedroom.  Whatever you can fit in will benefit you in remarkable ways.  And stop dwelling on yourself.  Get busy with other people.  Do things for your puppy and for your kid.  Doing for others is a wonderful way to put your own self in perspective.  Really.  None of us are so important that we deserve most of own attention.&lt;g&gt;   I know there&#39;s lots of writing out there about finding yourself, yada, yada, but honest to Pete, whatever you&#39;d accomplish by making music or staring at a wall will pale in comparison to what you will accomplish by dedicating yourself to making a joyful life for your family.   Talk about feeling good and changing the world?  Exalt a kid.  Give a dog a happy life.  Your inner whatever will be overflowing.      <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a choice and if you make the choice to unschool you&#39;ll need to make choices that support unschooling *everyday*.  You can&#39;t just say to yourself, &quot;Ok, I&#39;m unschooling&quot; and then sit back and wonder how it will all unfold.  You need to be an active participant in the choices you&#39;re making.&lt;g&gt;   Identify why you want to unschool and then make choices consistent with what you want.  You are empowered.  You have complete control.   <br/>
<br/>
Having a child and a puppy is a choice.  How you think about your life is a choice.  You can choose to think you&#39;re trapped and over run, or you can choose to think more positively about the life you&#39;ve made.  Everyone needs to find ways to handle the details of life.   Alone time or &quot;me time&quot; will not sustain you in any magical way that can&#39;t be achieved through a change in thinking.  Put the energy you&#39;re willing to spend on finding ways to get time alone into finding ways to have fun with your family.  You&#39;ll all be happier.<br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was six we lived in a very small house.  So small you probably can&#39;t picture how small.  My brother thought I was joking when I said &quot;You can stand in the middle of any room, take one big step and be in the next room.&quot; and laughed himself silly when he came for a visit.    We lived there seven years with Dylan, two dogs (one was a Basenji, so really that&#39;s like having six dogs&lt;g&gt;), five cats and a rabbit.  Dylan had friends over many times during the week.  We had three chairs in the living room and one of those was the piano bench. &lt;g&gt;   In the summer, David&#39;s nieces and nephews would visit us.  They could have stayed with their grandmother in her larger house but they *liked* our house.   To improve my mental state I would get up at two or three in the morning, whatever time my husband got up for work, and while he was getting ready, I&#39;d go out for a run.  <br/>
<br/>
 We made an outside living space with lawn chairs.  We made the yard inviting, with bird feeders and flowers and a sandbox, a swing and a garden.  We made sidewalk art and used the side of an old barn at the back of the lot for a place to hang a dart board.   Much of life was lived outside in the good weather.  Being busy and outside is good for mental health.  Go for walks, drives, bike rides, hikes.  If it&#39;s still snowy where you are go play in the snow, go sledding, find a place to skate, build an igloo, make a snowman.   If you don&#39;t have ideas about what to do to make life more fun, ask here.  Look in your local yellow pages for places you haven&#39;t visited yet or haven&#39;t been to in awhile.   Go on line to your local visitors center and see what your community recommends for tourists.  Be a tourist for a week.    <br/>
<br/>
Do more with your kid instead of looking for ways to do without her.  Not only will that help you get closer to unschooling, it will help you get closer to your kid.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong, it&#39;s your Mommy Radar telling you that being away<br/>
from Sophia is *not* the right thing to do.<br/>
Just to put your story into my perspective: Hannah had a bloody nose mid<br/>
January 2006 and was dead by Feb 24, a mere 6 weeks later. I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
the guilt I would have felt had I been acting on my selfish thoughts, (as a<br/>
single mama, I absolutely understand the urge to get a break, even an<br/>
overwhelming urge to get away) instead of reconnecting to the *mommy I am*<br/>
and remembering I had a whole 27 years before kids came and I&#39;ll have way<br/>
more than 27 years with them *not* as little kids.<br/>
This is a sacred time in your life, in Sophie&#39;s life, *this* mama suggests<br/>
you take advantage NOW (it&#39;s all ya got!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295928130">***By the way we have 4 cats and 2 dogs who seem to run the house and<br/>
disturb our sleep,***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s life with pets.   A baby disturbed your sleep too. <br/>
<br/>
*** the house is a wreck (I would not let my sister who<br/>
was visiting from out of state come over because of the mess, she<br/>
works for Head-start).***<br/>
<br/>
Pick up one thing and put it away and then do that again.   Fill up the sink with hot soapy water and every time you walk past, wash one thing and put it away.  Make a cake and call a friend to come help you with housework and then next week make a cake and go help her.   Start with one corner of one room.  Don&#39;t think about everything you have to do, pick one thing and do that and then pick another thing.   Why didn&#39;t you ask your sis for help?  Maybe she&#39;s not the helping kind.  : (<br/>
<br/>
Like unschooling and pet care, housework is not one thing you do one time.  It&#39;s ongoing and it will take some part of your time every day.  I think we sometimes feel like life should be a series of steps in one direction that take us somewhere.   It&#39;s not.  It&#39;s little choices we make every day, every day, every day, to do the things that sustain us.  It&#39;s not different somewhere else.  People with clean houses have clean houses because they clean them, or hire them cleaned.  People who don&#39;t care so much about clean houses  have livable houses because they give some part of their time to maintaining some level of &quot;livable.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
If you are not willing to maintain some level of livable then maybe school would be better for your kid.  If she&#39;s home with you but home is unpleasant because it&#39;s a mess or because mom is staring at a wall or because there&#39;s no money to go or do anything then school would be better.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re depressed, address that but you can, at the same time, take action to improve your life at home.  You can be depressed in a clean house too.  You can be depressed while you do dishes or mop the floor or walk the dog.  *Or*, you can choose not to dedicate yourself to your downward spiral and start grabbing for the things that can pull you up.  Something well done is inspiring and feeds a desire to move toward a more positive frame of mind.  Even if that thing is a load of laundry, a clean kitchen counter, a big pot of soup.  Depression can be seductive, but you&#39;re not powerless. <br/>
<br/>
Are you stuck thinking that if you could just find some time to be creative and do your art you&#39;d find the positive attitude you think you need to get more fully into life?   You can find that positive attitude in taking care of your house and kid.   There is a kind of art and creativity in caring for your home and family.   Stop looking for answers everywhere else and *get busy.*  Do something.  Really.  Get moving, get your blood pumping. Whirl into your housework and whirl into your life.   Light candles, put on some music, open a bag of M&M&#39;s (put them where the puppy can&#39;t reach if you want to have some for yourself) so you can grab a handful when you&#39;re zooming around picking up the house.   When you&#39;re muscles are working and your life is benefiting you will feel more creative and have more energy to do the creative things that help fulfill you.   But don&#39;t get trapped into thinking that fulfillment can only come if you can escape from your home or kid or life&#39;s responsibilities.  That&#39;s just not true.  You have the power and capability to do both, be a creative person and be a person living happily and comfortably in the life she&#39;s making.  <br/>
<br/>
***Add to that, we are very much in debt and going deeper every month<br/>
which makes going back to work very appealing.***<br/>
<br/>
What changes could you make to start living now within your means? <br/>
<br/>
When we were in a crunch we cut out satellite TV and asked our friends to record some of our favorite shows.  We ate more beans and rice.  We waited for movies to come out on video and then borrowed them when our friends rented them instead of going to the theater. &lt;g&gt;  We went on picnics to the park with peanut butter sandwiches instead of going out for lunch.  We changed our phone service to a cheaper one.  We sold some stuff.  We walked more places. We looked at where we could cut back and did that.   We didn&#39;t get rid of our kid or our critters but I guess we could have.  That choice wouldn&#39;t have been consistent with our principles, though. <br/>
<br/>
If we were in a crunch again now I wouldn&#39;t get rid of our cable service because Dylan ins liking some things on TV right now and I wouldn&#39;t bugger that up for him.  But I could quit my bottled water habit and my smelly hand lotion habit and make other changes to save money that wouldn&#39;t cost our kid his comfort and happiness. <br/>
<br/>
I think there are some creative unschooling mom&#39;s finding ways to make a little extra cash.  Maybe some will share their ideas with you.  I went to work two days a week when our vet bills became more than our budget could absorb.  I work early, and am usually home by the time my kid gets up in the early afternoon.  <br/>
<br/>
 Debt is a bummer but debt will, unfortunately,  wait for you.  Your kid can&#39;t wait.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295164861">You know Rachel,<br/>
  I agree with Deb about this issue BUT there are times when it is better for the dogs to be re-homed.  When I talk about re=homing it is not to make it easier for you ( that may also happen) but to give that animal what he/she deserves.<br/>
  The dog I re-homed was a show dog that loved being primped up and it was unfir to have him all by himself for hours alone in an apartment while I was busy in Law School. He went to live with Schnauzer breeders that I co-owned animals with. He was surrounded by other schnauzers including his offsprings. He was primped several times a week ( he just loved being in the table and getting brushed). I did not do it for me, I did it for him. <br/>
  On the other hand I had a german shepard I got right after I graduated that went with me everywhere. I moved form Brazil here with her. I had to pay more to have her in apartments.<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  I have been working with dogs for 30 years and I always tell people that when they get a dog it becomes part of the family and it is a life time commitment. I also tell people to first look into adopting instead of buying dogs for many reasons.<br/>
  To give those animals a chance, to know what they are getting into ( shelters may know the animal&#39;s personality) .<br/>
  I also ask that they research the breed to see if it can be a good fit to your family.<br/>
  My dogs have always been like my kids and been part of the family but If I needed to re-home a dog I would do it . I would make sure the home was a perfect fit for that animal because they deserve better. <br/>
  I see so many people that get dogs and have no clue what they are getting into and the animal is the one who suffers.<br/>
   <br/>
  But having said all that I loved what Deb wrote. That was an inspiring post and you should read it many times to yourself.<br/>
  Heck I am going to print and read when I get crabby because the house is a mess.......<br/>
  If you decide it is better for them to be re-homed please make sure your dd is OK with that. I know my kids would never be able to be OK with any of my animals going away.<br/>
   <br/>
  I had a discussion with my DH today about CHOICES.<br/>
  Everything you do in life is your choice. You make the choice of being with your dd and enjoying her OR not. You make the choice of loving her the way she is right now.<br/>
  I loved what Deb said about being empoweredin your choices.<br/>

days a week. She gets to pick the days that she goes a week in advance<br/>
(for registration and payment purposes) and I will not force her to go<br/>

thought of having this as an option to get some time to decompress has<br/>
made me feel better.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She has in the past asked to be a part of this program because we<br/>
often swim  in the pool at the same time the kids in the program are<br/>
there. There are no education or academic things involved except for a<br/>
provided time for the kids to do homework if they have it. Activities<br/>
include, swimming, climbing the rock wall, playing on the basketball<br/>
courts, outside play, crafts, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All of the counselors are familiar faces and she is familiar with the<br/>
building since we have gone there regularly since she was a baby. <br/>

All of the above sounds like justification to me but I am not going to<br/>
change it because I really want to understand. <br/>

&gt;why she can&#39;t be home.   If you ever hope to be dedicated to<br/>
&gt;unschooling, sending her out to programs, by herself, while you stare<br/>
&gt;at walls, will not get you there.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t really want to stare at walls, I was being dramatic. I want a<br/>
bit of time to gather my thoughts, meditate, play some music, write a<br/>
song, etc. Our house is small, old, and very loud. There is really no<br/>
such thing as a quiet place or time. If Sophia was asleep before me at<br/>
night AND if there was a place for me to play my piano and guitar<br/>
without the sound echoing through the whole house, I believe that<br/>
would help.<br/>
<br/>
As a solution ,DH and I talked about closing off our dining area and<br/>
sound proofing it to make a music room. I contacted another<br/>
unschooling friend whose Dh does remodeling and he will most likely do<br/>
the work. More debt but I think it will be worth it in the end. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to send her out. I want to enjoy being with her. She is<br/>
an amazing girl. <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It SHOULD bother you to be away from her.  She&#39;s six.  Your her mom.<br/>
  &gt;Maybe I misunderstood what you meant here but it looks like you<br/>
&gt;suspect there&#39;s something wrong with you because you feel guilty<br/>
&gt;about ditching your kid.    The problem is not your guilt.  The<br/>
&gt;problem is the thing that&#39;s urging you to put her in a program.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep on all accounts. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 *******************************************<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why *did* you get a puppy?   <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought Zoe needed a buddy and because Sophia wanted one. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you in the habit of acting before you&#39;ve thought a thing &gt;through?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, in a way. I think and think and research lots and then it becomes<br/>
all jumbled in my head and I can&#39;t figure out what the *correct*<br/>
decision is. Then I make a decision based on how I would like things<br/>
to be or how I would like to think of myself, not a reality based<br/>
decision. For example, I am mostly a couch potato person but I would<br/>
like to be, and sometime actually manage to be for short durations, an<br/>
active runner type of person who will take her active type dogs for<br/>
hour walks/runs everyday.<br/>
*******************************************************<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Did you decide to unschool in the same way you decided to get a &gt;puppy? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really want to say no, but reality is a yes, I think. I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine Sophia in a school setting without her spirit being crushed. I<br/>
 thought about homeschooling since she was born because I knew  she<br/>
and school would not be a good fit. Then I came across unschooling and<br/>
it sounded like a very good fit to how Sophia is.<br/>
 <br/>
***********************************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It may be that your thoughts, understanding and dedication to<br/>
&gt;unschooling are superficial and more research will help you decide<br/>
&gt;one way or another. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, not what I expected to hear. In fact I am a bit angry at the<br/>
*superficial*, which tells me it is a sore spot and probably holds<br/>
some truth. Ouch.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;without your help.    You have all the power and you&#39;re writing like<br/>

&gt;wins.    Or *better yet*, get out and walk the dogs yourself, with<br/>
&gt;your daughter, and explore your neighborhood and town, and delight in<br/>
&gt;your puppy.   The exercise will help your mental state and the walk<br/>
&gt;will be a nice way to spend time with your kid and your puppy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did take the older dog for a walk and got the puppy some good play<br/>
time this morning. They are both napping quietly right now.<br/>

&gt;she was obviously INSANE, but it did help me see that &quot;Easy&quot; wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;what I wanted.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL. I do understand this. I love my kids. I love my husband. I love<br/>
all my animals. They are all the good stuff that really matters in<br/>
this existence. That is why I am here for advice because I don&#39;t want<br/>

&gt;music or staring at a wall will pale in comparison to what you will<br/>
&gt;accomplish by dedicating yourself to making a joyful life for your<br/>
&gt;family.   Talk about feeling good and changing the world?  Exalt a<br/>
&gt;kid.  Give a dog a happy life.  Your inner whatever will be<br/>
&gt;overflowing. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am resentful for not being able to play music. It has always been my<br/>
way of coping with stress, finding my center. I have read in other<br/>
posts people being advised to meditate or find some time to take a<br/>
break. Why would my thing be different? What am I missing?<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I think I all ready found a solution to this one with making<br/>
the dining area a music room. That would allow me to play if/when<br/>
Sophia is asleep without me. Again, just the thought that this will<br/>
happen gives me hope.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YEP. Dh and I are cleaning up the house while Sophia is playing at a<br/>
friends (she asked to go over) and I am feeling better today anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
Still, this year since beginning to unschooling has been hard for me.<br/>
I want to *get it* and at moments I do, but then it&#39;s gone. Then there<br/>
are the moments when I can&#39;t imagine doing it any different. Maybe I<br/>
am trying too hard to understand how it works instead of just doing<br/>
the work to make it work.<br/>
<br/>
Your words hear give me lots to think about.<br/>

I just had a thought: Do you have a local unschooling group? And/or an <br/>
unschooling friend who lives close by that you can talk to, ask <br/>
questions, vent to, get advice from?<br/>
<br/>
Advice from an online group is great but nothing takes the place of a <br/>
close friend who gets unschooling and gets you. Someone who can look at <br/>
your situation first hand and help you out, maybe take S. for a <br/>
playdate or just be there in an unschooling perspective.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761380546">I can&#39;t remember what the post was about or how long ago it was, but<br/>
someone on this board once said something to the effect of...<br/>
<br/>
When you meet a need, the need disappears.<br/>
<br/>
This statement rings over and over in my head.  Especially when I&#39;m<br/>
feeling stressed.  When my kids are really needing me I do my best to<br/>
meet their needs in the best way possible.  (making food, playing a<br/>
game, cuddling, etc.) and later on this need seemingly disappears. <br/>
They seem to be so much more content for the remainder of the day. <br/>
Same with the dog.  I have a Puggle (half Beagle Half Pug).  If he is<br/>
hyper or howling, I know I haven&#39;t met his needs. He&#39;s also a puppy<br/>
and is a chewer.  But if I meet his needs, take him for a walk,<br/>
roughhouse with him a little, make sure he has plenty to chew on, then<br/>
he is a great puppy and really tends to listen much better.  <br/>
<br/>
My point is that when you meet everyone&#39;s needs, it becomes possible<br/>
to meet your own.  Instead of running from the problem, bring your<br/>
self closer to it, and meet their needs.  You will find much more time<br/>
for yourself even while the kids and dogs are in the house.  <br/>

was it but it made a huge difference.~~<br/>
<br/>
We sometimes do our &quot;10 minute clean ups&quot; where we set the timer for<br/>
10 minutes and do as much as we can, as fast as we can in just one<br/>
room. Then we move to the next room. After about 2-3 rooms it really<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem like the house is that messy.:)<br/>

my girls at 6, and even now my 10 year old, wouldn&#39;t like to be left <br/>
alone even with wonderful things to do.  They&#39;d want to know that <br/>
someone &quot;belonging to them&quot; was there with them, just in case.  <br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if it was the sort of program where you&#39;d &quot;have&quot; <br/>
to leave her, or if you could participate with her.  Exercise and <br/>
hanging out with others would probably help with depression, too.<br/>

&gt; Rachel, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just had a thought: Do you have a local unschooling group? And/or an <br/>
&gt; unschooling friend who lives close by that you can talk to, ask <br/>
&gt; questions, vent to, get advice from?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Advice from an online group is great but nothing takes the place of a <br/>
&gt; close friend who gets unschooling and gets you. Someone who can look at <br/>
&gt; your situation first hand and help you out, maybe take S. for a <br/>
&gt; playdate or just be there in an unschooling perspective.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think I would have made it a week without my local group! <br/>

you are on this list. <br/>
<br/>
The e-mail that was from my original post was sent to a good friend<br/>
who I met through unschooling (on Alwaysunschooled??). She responded<br/>
with wonderful words of encouragement and an offer to do a play date<br/>
exchange a couple times a week (one of her kids is close to Sophia&#39;s<br/>
age and they love to play together). This sounds really good to me.<br/>
