My mother was none the wiser to the toll it was taking on me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
SO why didn&#39;t you tell her?<br/>
<br/>
If it was because she might say, &quot;I told you so,&quot; maybe that was why. <br/>
That happens a lot. Parents warn children of the dire consequences then <br/>
get to &quot;gloat&quot; in a way that they were right. That the child wasn&#39;t <br/>
ready for it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important for me to know that my kids can trust me if they aren&#39;t <br/>
commfortable with something they see or hear. They know I will isten <br/>
and help them through it.<br/>
<br/>
This extends to drugs and drinking and sex---I could say, &quot;Don&#39;t do <br/>
it,&quot; or I could say, &quot; When you decide you&#39;re ready to explore, be <br/>
smart about it. Let me help you through. Trust me to be there when you <br/>
need me. Call me if you&#39;re ever in trouble.&quot; Saying, &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; won&#39;t <br/>
gain their trust. Saying, &quot;I&#39;m here if you need me---no matter *how* <br/>
bad it is,&quot; will show them that I am their partner in this.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It took a<br/>
very long time before I opened up to my mom about my fears.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why? Why didn&#39;t you tell her?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I guess I just don&#39;t agree with the line of thinking that what our <br/>
children watch on TV doesn&#39;t have an<br/>
affect on them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Everything effects us. It&#39;s whether they have our support that is the <br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I really do believe in self-regulation for children, but with TV I&#39;m <br/>
not so sure.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Huh? It&#39;s a box. With an on/off switch.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s influence is much more powerful than we give it credit <br/>
for.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of fear for a box.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I do think children take in what they watch and absorb it. They may <br/>
not understand as we adults do and<br/>
how they process it may be even worse than we think.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We all take in parts of what we watch. Many adults don&#39;t understad <br/>
parts.<br/>
<br/>
But if we are there for them and helping them through, it&#39;s not scary <br/>
OR more powerful than the children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I should clarify that I am not against television for religious<br/>
reasons, as I get asked that a lot. It purely from my experience with<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your expereince that it&#39;s more pwerful than you are?<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I do not see any benefit to television.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
ANY????<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a television in my home. It certainly wouldn&#39;t be fair to <br/>
tell my<br/>
children they couldn&#39;t watch tv while I did, so I&#39;ve gotten rid of it<br/>
altogether. Therefore (at least for the time being) eliminating the<br/>
hassle it seems to cause. I don&#39;t have to worry about what they<br/>
watch, because it&#39;s not simply not an option without a TV in the<br/>
house. I want my children (at least in their younger years) to grow<br/>
up with a reverence for the world.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a computer in my home. It certainly wouldn&#39;t be fair to <br/>
tell my<br/>
children they couldn&#39;t work on the computer while I did, so I&#39;ve gotten <br/>
rid of it<br/>
altogether. Therefore (at least for the time being) eliminating the<br/>
hassle it seems to cause. I don&#39;t have to worry about what they<br/>
watch, because it&#39;s not simply not an option without a computer in the<br/>
house. I want my children (at least in their younger years) to grow<br/>
up with a reverence for the world.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have books in my home. It certainly wouldn&#39;t be fair to tell my <br/>
<br/>
children they couldn&#39;t read books while I did, so I&#39;ve gotten rid of <br/>
them<br/>
altogether. Therefore (at least for the time being) eliminating the<br/>
hassle it seems to cause. I don&#39;t have to worry about what they<br/>

<br/>
Sound any better? Worse?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I realize that unschooling is about giving our children access to<br/>
what they love. I really do. I understand it is about connection &<br/>
sharing. I understand that forbidding something makes it even worse.<br/>
However, do we really think that a murder scene on TV is what our<br/>
young children want to see,<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
What young child WANTS to see a murder seen?<br/>
<br/>
My always-unschooled 11 year old does NOT want to see murder or sex or <br/>
violence. He turns the channel or leave the room.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
or is it simply wanting to be close to a<br/>
parent who is watching such a show that they really want?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That parent is NOT respecting the child. I have TiVo. If Duncan wants <br/>
to hang with me, but I&#39;m watching Law & Order, I&#39;ll record it to watch <br/>
early the next morning before he&#39;s awake. AMazingly, he&#39;ll do the same <br/>
thing if Aqua Teen Hunger Force is on because *I* don&#39;t want to watch <br/>
that. We respect each other&#39;s choices and personal boundaries. We don&#39;t <br/>
impose ours on each other.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is wanting to be part of the conversation between mom & dad what they <br/>
want, as<br/>
opposed to watching the news itself?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t have both?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Am I alone here? Is their anyone out there that has similar feelings?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure that there are others out here, but I hope they are trying to <br/>
get past that because it&#39;ll make unschooling blossom is they can get <br/>
past those limited feelings.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m sure I&#39;m going to get flack for this post. Really, I&#39;m giving my <br/>
thoughts most sincerely. I&#39;m<br/>
curious to know if others feel this way, and if not what is the <br/>
reasoning?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My reasoning is that my kids like to make their own choices. They may <br/>
not always be the same choices *I* make, but they&#39;re learning how they <br/>
world works and what works for hem. My goal is that I want them to be <br/>
comfortable making that big transition of moving out on their own <br/>
(Cameron, at 19, is close) and tarting their own families. Without the <br/>
opportunity to make their own decisions, their own choices----and even <br/>
their own learning-takes (commonly called mistakes)---they will have no <br/>
basis to start with.<br/>
