<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763070676">Hi Robyn,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your reply.  I appreciated it.  Yeah, I will have a conversation<br/>
with dh about all this.  It&#39;s good for me to hear about how all that Daniel<br/>
is doing is all a normal part of this process.. I feel I need to hear that<br/>
alot at the moment.  This deschooling is just as much a journey for me as it<br/>
is for him.<br/>
<br/>
If there are others out there lurking on the list who have pulled their kids<br/>
out of school and who have been through this same process....., and are<br/>
either right in the midst of it or have passed on thru, I would absolutely<br/>
love to hear from you!!  If you would prefer to email me privately, please<br/>
do so on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hilary@...">hilary@...</a><br/>
<br/>
When does this focus on computer games start to widen a little!?!?!?!<br/>
<br/>
Bye for now - and yes, I am feeling much better today, thanks!<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;He told em at the end of the day after having dropped Dan off at Drama<br/>
class that he was really pissed off with Daniel as he had spent all day<br/>
playing Runescape and had told him he was not to play any more computer<br/>
games between 9am and 3pm.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does dh realize that he designated school hours as the verboten time?<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if he was having a knee jerk reaction to an unexpressed desire to<br/>
have more of his step son&#39;s attention, spend more time together doing fun<br/>
stuff? Perhaps he is feeling left out, especially as you are ill also and<br/>
presumably unavailable. Not that I agree with his proposed solution to the<br/>
problem!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; to find my way to feeling OK about it. We ended the conv by him saying<br/>
something like &quot;well, you should at least enforce that for a week&quot;. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to feel ok about a plan that sounds increasingly like a<br/>
punishment. I like that he wants you to the dirty work of enforcement! My dh<br/>
is like that too sometimes: &quot;I have this problem, here&#39;s how *you* fix it&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I think trying to get at what your dh actually wants, rather than<br/>
focusing on what he doesn&#39;t want, might help. Even getting him to elucidate<br/>
what the heck he hopes to gain by this limitation idea, might help him to<br/>
realize how counterproductive it is - he might talk himself out of it.(My dh<br/>
does that sometimes too.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; He still seems so<br/>
<br/>
unmotivated, a little lost - he came out of school last July (remembering<br/>
that our summer break in NZ is December/January).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Definitely your son is still deschooling, and by others&#39; accounts this<br/>
appearance of &quot;unmotivated&quot; is typical (almost universal!), as is the focus<br/>
on computer games.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you feel well soon.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Hilary,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am one of those lurkers that you have called out, and I am in the<br/>
middle of what you are going thru.  <br/>
<br/>
I pulled my 14yo son(now 15) out of school last Oct, and his days<br/>
consist of sleeping late and then playing computer games for most of<br/>
his awake time.  It bothered me a lot at first, but I came to this<br/>
list and found some other local unschooling lists too and did a lot of<br/>
reading.  I learned 2 important things that have helped me to relax<br/>
and trust in unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
1. On average it takes 1 month of de-schooling for every year your<br/>
child has been schooled in the &quot;typical&quot; way (10 years for my son, so<br/>
he&#39;s still de-schooling and I&#39;m going to let him take all the time he<br/>
needs - regular school really damaged his confidence in himself!)<br/>
<br/>
2. It is amazing the wide variety of things someone can learn by<br/>
playing video games!  Below are some links I used to put together<br/>
information for my son&#39;s portfolio review that he has this week. You<br/>
will find them totally encouraging and showing them to your husband<br/>
might help a lot too: <br/>
<br/>
 www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hollow/1093/tvandvideogames.html<br/>
<br/>
 sandradodd.com/games/page<br/>
<br/>
 www.unschoolinginfo/articles/article7.htm<br/>
<br/>
As far as his interest widening, I do get books and magazines for him<br/>
on other subjects I know he is interested in too, then leave them in<br/>
his bedroom.  Sometimes, when I am sure he hasn&#39;t been doing anything<br/>
but playing games, I find the books on his nightstand and know he&#39;s<br/>
been reading them on his own.  He has actually read quite a lot - and<br/>
he hated to read when he was in public school!  Unschooling does work<br/>
if your child feels like he is making the decisions and not being forced.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
 ~Kim<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m another lurker.  I feel like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde sometimes <br/>
about the computer games.  My daughter (12, currently in 6th grade) <br/>
has 13 more days of school, THEN we&#39;ll be <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling/deschooling.  I know we both need LOTS of <br/>
time to adjust.   <br/>
<br/>
Currently she&#39;s VERY into Runescape (before that it was Toontown <br/>
Online, which she said she&#39;s enjoys once in a while but is starting <br/>
to &quot;outgrow&quot; and neopets).  I&#39;m the one that suggested Runescape to <br/>
her, after someone on one of the yahoo groups (don&#39;t remember which <br/>
one) said their children enjoyed it.  She likes dragons/medieval and <br/>
interactive (live) on-line stuff.  I haven&#39;t actually looked at it <br/>
much or watched her play much as I&#39;ve had too much going on, so I <br/>
really can&#39;t be fair in &quot;critiquing&quot; it or criticizing it.  It DOES <br/>
seem really interesting.  <br/>
<br/>
I think what bothers me is that I know there are other things she&#39;s <br/>
intersted in, and she&#39;ll find them or get to them in her own time, <br/>
when she&#39;s ready.  And to be honest with myself, I have a lot of <br/>
varied interests, things I haven&#39;t had time to do when working full <br/>
time (and then having to work with her at night on &quot;homework&quot; aka <br/>
busywork much of the time) that I can&#39;t WAIT to get to.  I&#39;m <br/>
projecting my enthusiasm about our soon to be had freedom on to her <br/>
and expecting her to feel differently (&quot;more like me&quot;).  I KNOW we <br/>
have to deschool, I KNOW we need time, I KNOW all the things that <br/>
need to happen or not happen.<br/>
<br/>
I just needed to write it, not very well, but it&#39;s a start.  I&#39;m very <br/>
tired and need to sleep!  Plus I&#39;m getting stressed about my foot <br/>
surgery this Friday, but the good thing is, I can&#39;t return to work <br/>
for 3 weeks or longer and I had already planned to quit at the end of <br/>
June, so it works out.  I&#39;ve been working towards this for over a <br/>
year (a lot has gone on in our lives this past year that I may not <br/>
have shared, perhaps another time), I&#39;ve held on for so long, it&#39;s <br/>
hard to finally realize it&#39;s really going to happen, and soon! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to have a place like this from which to absorb some words of <br/>
wisdom and experience.<br/>

Not a lurker... but I pulled Cameron (now 17) out of school at the end <br/>
of sixth grade.<br/>
<br/>
Life was tough for almost two years.<br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s so busy with so many things that we have two daytimers to keep <br/>
track.<br/>
<br/>
What specific questions do you have?<br/>

When he&#39;s had his fill and is ready to pursue other things. Seems <br/>
