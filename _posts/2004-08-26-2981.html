<div id="ygrps-yiv-552864162"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;EVERY time, <br/>
&gt;&gt;like right now, I sit she wants mama milk...is 2.5<br/>
&gt;&gt;too young for me to <br/>
&gt;&gt;refuse? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have been struggling with this for about 1 1/2 years<br/>
now.  When my now 3 year old was 1, I got pregnant<br/>
again, and although I nursed all through my pregnancy<br/>
and am currently still tandem nursing there have been<br/>
(and still are) several times that I really don&#39;t feel<br/>
like nursing my 3 year old.  This has been a struggle<br/>
(largely mentally) because I have always nursed on<br/>
demand.  Then my nipples started to hurt, and I&#39;d<br/>
always try to let the baby have priority when it came<br/>
to nursing, and I didn&#39;t always want to nurse them<br/>
both at the same time.  Anyhow, I am still finding the<br/>
comfortable balance.  One thing that I found helpful<br/>
to say when there was a time I did not want to nurse<br/>
my 3 year old was to let him know *when the next time<br/>
would be that he could nurse*.  He usually seems ok<br/>
and satisfied by this.  Because if I would just say<br/>
no, not right now, he may freak out and think he would<br/>
never get to nurse again.  But if I say something<br/>
like, not right now how about after we eat breakfast?<br/>
that really helps!  Being honest seems key to me. <br/>
Another example, letting him know if one of my nipples<br/>
is sore- he&#39;s very understanding about that and will<br/>
even point that out.<br/>
<br/>
A recent book that came out a couple months after my<br/>
second son, now 1, was born: Adventures in Tandem<br/>
Nursing by Hillary Flowers is very insightful. <br/>
Perhaps some of this will help your situation.<br/>
