<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370491772">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to introduce myself - I&#39;ve just joined this list and have been<br/>
reading some of your posts with interest so I thought I&#39;d be polite and not<br/>
just lurk!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Sarah and I live in Northern Ireland - on the North Coast, with<br/>
my husband Conch√∫r (pronounced Connor) and son Jack.  Jack is only nine<br/>
months old but I&#39;ve been reading alot since he was born (mostly walking<br/>
around the room!).  We both work from home, running our own business - IT,<br/>
databases and so on...<br/>
<br/>
Having spent far too much time in formal eduation myself I&#39;m a compulsive<br/>
researcher so I&#39;ve consumed a ludicrous number of articles, books, messages<br/>
and websites.  Reading on Attachment Parenting led me on to thinking about<br/>
home-schooling and from there I found John Holt&#39;s &quot;Instead of Education&quot;,<br/>
which completely blew me away.  What an amazing and inspiring book!  I<br/>
honestly don&#39;t know how you could read it and then send your child to<br/>
school, if you had any other option at all!  That book led me to look for,<br/>
and find you lot!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I look forward to getting to know you all - if you have any books to<br/>
reccomend I&#39;d love to keep right on reading...<br/>
<br/>
Sarah<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261428980">Hello, <br/>
  I&#39;d like to introduce myself.  My name is Vanessa and I have 3 children 9 yr old daughter, 23 month old son, and 6 month old daughter.  We just started unschooling Halloween 2007.  Before that we were a part of the public school system.  Homeschool let alone unschooling was something that I stumbled upon last year and I&#39;m very greatful that I did.  <br/>
<br/>
I love my children and I&#39;m so glad I get an opportunity to see them as the learners they are. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970629007">Hi everyone, <br/>
I am Diana, my husband and I have 2 children Sarah (15) and Brian (14) we also have 1 dog (Buster), 1 cat (baby) and 2 shetland ponies (Bonnie and Delight) <br/>
When Daughter was 3 I decided that rather than put her in a preschool we would do preschool at home, by the time she turned 5 I let the world and my inner critic convince me that I was not capable of schooling my children and that the best place for them to learn was in a public school... my children and I have been banging out heads against a brick wall ever sence! I did pull my kids out for 1 year of homeschool, but ended up putting them back in the next year. <br/>
Five weeks ago I finally found the courage to begin to listen to and trust what my kids were saying, I pulled them out of school and started traditional homeschooling... a week ago we let go of that as well and started on our unschooling journey...<br/>
<br/>
24 hours I can not believe how excited my son is!! <br/>
We talked today and set a plan in motion to start this new adventure, the goal is to make and sell glass marbles, tomorrow we will go get the supplies needed to start making clay marbles, set up a website to keep track of progress, set up an ebay sales account to sell things to earn money for a shed that he is going to build in our back yard to use as a workshop, purchase all the supplies needed to make glass marbles and then move on to making a glass yo-yo! For a kid with aspergers syndrome who walks around the house eating his dinner because he can&#39;t focus on eating or sitting that long, he totally blew me away today when he announced that he figured it would take a good 2 years after he got the equipment to make the marbles, before he would be experianced enough to make the one he wanted. (he saw a picture of it today, totally awesome with a dragon in the middle) he has even arranged to sell one to one of his friends.<br/>
He has been thinking, planning and talking about his plan all day long, being released from the constraints of learning from a book has given me my child back and given my child his life back!! <br/>
I even saw his smile today :-)<br/>
My daughter is excited as well, she wants to be a horse trainer and now she can focus on that full time, rather than &quot;on learning what she needs to know to pass a state test so that she can graduate and recieve a diploma that in the long run means nothing anyway&quot; her words, I agree:-) <br/>
<br/>
Wow, I did not intend for this introduction to be so long, anyway I am so glad to be here and to get to know you all. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-463425754">Welcome, Diana! I&#39;m Meredith, mom to Mo 7, who&#39;s been &quot;always&quot; unschooled, and also stepmom to Ray who is 15 and has only been living and unschooling with us for two and a half years.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; He has been thinking, planning and talking about his plan all day long, being released from the constraints of learning from a book has given me my child back and given my child his life back!! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s wonderful. Ray&#39;s whole first week &quot;free&quot; he was head over heels with giddy delight. That&#39;s tempered a good bit, naturally, but he&#39;s still a much much happier person than he ever was in school. In fact, just last weekend we went on a campout with a whole pack of unschooling families, many with teens, and I was really struck by how joyful they all were. I don&#39;t mean they were giggling like four year olds or something, but they weren&#39;t the sullen, angry people that so many teens are. It really makes a Huge difference.<br/>
<br/>
Its exciting that both your kids are diving into plans whole-hog (as they say in my neck of the woods). Don&#39;t worry if that tapers off, or even disappears for awhile - and don&#39;t let *them* worry if their enthusiasm dwindles, either. Its normal for people of all ages to have cycles of greater and lesser intensity. Its also normal for teens, especially, to go through periods of introspection and quiet. In fact, given the kinds of pressures school can exert, it would be a good idea to actively create some opportunities for them to do some serious relaxation. <br/>
<br/>
Take some time to do fun things together - go hiking or fishing or visit a museum just for the sake of hanging out together. Rent a bunch of movies and spend a day curled up on the couch. Buy some jigsaw puzzles. Whatever sort of &quot;relaxation&quot; works well for your kids and family. <br/>
<br/>
Let your kids know that they don&#39;t have to have it all &quot;figured out&quot; by the time they&#39;re 18 - that&#39;s one of the insidious messages school sends. Its stressful. They don&#39;t have to figure out what they&#39;re going to do with &quot;the rest of their lives&quot; - not at 18, or 28, or 58.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638868697">Hi Meredith, <br/>
Thank you for the welcome, and the ideas, my son has already settled down a bit, he is still wanting to do the marbles plan, but has calmed about it a bit and has begun to show a bit of interest in other things as well, mostly though he is spending a lot of time doing nothing... <br/>
One thing that is a bit of concern is his defiant attitude, it is almost as if he is on some power trip, he continually tells us &quot;no&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t have to&quot; &quot;you can&#39;t make me&quot; he has a total disreguard for the basic family rules... speak nice, no hitting, ect... is this normal... should I be concerned or will this fade with time? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, <br/>
Diana</div>
