<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198713993">I think it would be more accurate to say that Hanson was the first<br/>
leader of the United States. Our country was named, he was elected.<br/>
That makes him the first leader in my book.<br/>
The position did not have the same power or significance at that<br/>
time...our current constitution was not drafted yet.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The failure of the Articles of Confederation led to calls for<br/>
establishment of a centralized federal government with much broader<br/>
powers than the Congress of the Confederacy, a task accomplished<br/>
through the drafting and ratification of a new Constitution in<br/>
1787-88. It was this Constitution, not the Articles of Confederation,<br/>
that created the office of a chief executive as part of a truly<br/>
federal government for the United States Â— an office bearing the title<br/>
&quot;President of the United States of America&quot; and first filled by George<br/>
Washington, unanimously selected as the first President in February 1789.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I just find it interesting that our country was founded, 8 leaders<br/>
elected to govern the main branch of government at the time and yet<br/>
were never mentioned in my U.S. History classes in school.<br/>
<br/>
Not a very in-depth look at our history in my opinion.  George<br/>
Washington was the first president under our current<br/>
constitution...but he was the 9th elected leader of our country.<br/>
