 </span></blockquote>LOL - I&#39;m glad you made that very clear Ren!  LOL  It is hard.  We <br/>
started RU when we were living at our old place in Baltimore.  Now <br/>
we have to do this whole &quot;don&#39;t touch this&quot; &quot;don&#39;t do that&quot; and I <br/>
know it&#39;s hard for them.  We need to find our own place ASAP!!!  Of <br/>
course, you know how it is when you&#39;re around family: you have a <br/>
tendency to slide back into &quot;family roles&quot;, and I know I&#39;ve been <br/>
doing that way too much: becoming the insecure one, the one who&#39;s <br/>
not sure of what she&#39;s doing, the one who lets everyone else take <br/>
the lead.....and that&#39;s not the person I&#39;ve become (can anyone else <br/>
relate to the whole family roles thing??)  I have to center myself <br/>
and remember how competent and confident I am, and be that person <br/>
that shines - if for no one else for my children, so they don&#39;t <br/>
forget who they are as well.<br/>
<br/>
By the way...I&#39;m reading a book that&#39;s really helping me to not be <br/>
so stressed.  It&#39;s called The Soul of the Child by Michael Gurian.  <br/>
I haven&#39;t finished it, but it&#39;s been a real eye opener.  I&#39;m also <br/>
reading Siblings Without Rivalry, and boy!  Do I feel like a big <br/>
boob!  LOL.  Especially with that whole &quot;family roles&quot; thing.  I <br/>
don&#39;t want to do that to my children - yuck.  I&#39;m working really <br/>
hard on not being so stressed out in this situation.  It&#39;s causing <br/>
me to back-track on the personal growth I&#39;d been doing (thanks to <br/>
this group - you guys rock!!!!)  Whenever I can I&#39;ll be reading the <br/>
posts.  It&#39;s like my daily &quot;fix&quot; on how to be a mindful and loving <br/>
parent.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m am soooo grateful today for this group.  You guys keep me sane!!!<br/>

<br/>
Oh yes....I can totally relate. I was labeled the<br/>
&quot;difficult/argumentative&quot; child. Interestingly, while I&#39;m very strong<br/>
and opinionated, I manage to get along fabulously with my friends,<br/>
coworkers and just about everyone I run into. If I have a differing<br/>
opinion...we talk and they know exactly how I feel, but it never leads<br/>
to problems.<br/>
<br/>
If I start a discussion with one of my family members, it inevitably<br/>
turns WAY more aggressive and ugly than with ANYONE else!! I can<br/>
literally feel those old emotional patterns surface and the need to BE<br/>
HEARD. I got that &quot;argumentative&quot; label and that seemed to be the<br/>
excuse my family needed,  to brush off my very strong feelings rather<br/>
than validate them when I was a child. I turn into the child that<br/>
needs validation. I get more angry than I otherwise would, because I<br/>
can literally HEAR them thinking &quot;oh, there she goes again&quot;. ARgh.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s tough to break out of those patterns. Our childhood has a strong<br/>
influence on us and the people that surrounded us at that time (no<br/>
matter how much we love them) can send us spiraling into old roles<br/>
that no longer serve us well.<br/>
<br/>
It seems silly...but it&#39;s very real.<br/>
My well-intentioned Grandmother asked when Trevor was going to<br/>
&quot;graduate&quot; and take his high school tests. sigh. I could feel those<br/>
old feelings rising up, but I gave her a pat answer and started<br/>
talking about other stuff. Didn&#39;t skirt the issue, told her the truth<br/>
(homeschoolers don&#39;t need to take tests) and moved on.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there Maisha, I&#39;m sure things will turn around soon.<br/>

I got into some ugly squabbling with my brother in July, so I know<br/>
what you mean, and I&#39;ve been reflecting on it.<br/>
<br/>
I listened to the audio version of the book by Deborah Tannen titled<br/>
_I&#39;m Only Saying This Because I Love You_ which is about communication<br/>
in families, especially about communication between now-adult children<br/>
and their parents or siblings.  The book had some pretty good content,<br/>
and lots of examples.<br/>
<br/>
I especially recommend the chapter dealing with likely differences<br/>
between how men and women feel about apologies.<br/>

Yeah, I&#39;d love to hear a synopsis on the book. It might  help me not<br/>
revert to being the unheard, invalidated, angry teenager when I&#39;m<br/>
around certain family members.:)<br/>

OK, the book title is _I Only Say This Because I Love You_, by Deborah<br/>
Tannen.  I found some quotable snippets with the search feature on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
For starters she says women generally are quick to say &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;,<br/>
but that men are less so.  It seems that women may equate saying &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
sorry&quot; with thinking &quot;I sympathize&quot; but men feel that saying &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
sorry&quot; means &quot;Yes, I am guilty; I am a terrible sinner; I abase<br/>
myself.&quot;  (This is my own rephrasing.)  Thus men tend to be much more<br/>
reluctant to apologize; they feel they really lose a lot of status or<br/>
face if they do apologize.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple of (truncated) quotes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For many of us (more women than men), apologies come in pairs and<br/>
constitute a ritual exchange: I apologize for x, then you apologize<br/>
for y, and we both consider the matter closed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...because most men don&#39;t recognize the ritual nature of women&#39;s<br/>
apologies and don&#39;t expect people to apologize when they don&#39;t have<br/>
to. By the same token, women tend to overinterpret men&#39;s not apologizing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(About a husband who forgot to mail a letter -&gt;) &quot;No explanation. No<br/>
apology. She was furious-not because he had forgotten (though that<br/>
certainly irked her) but because he didn&#39;t apologize. &quot;If I had done<br/>
that,&quot; she told me, &quot;I would have fallen all over myself saying how<br/>
sorry I was.&quot; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ironically, the more a woman demands an apology, the more a man may<br/>
resiste complying because the demand in itself makes apologizing seem<br/>
more like a degradation ritual.  If she told him that something he did<br/>
had hurt or upset her he had armsful of talk he&#39;d unload: excuses,<br/>
counterattacks, deflecting the blame-anything but admitting he&#39;d made<br/>
a mistake and was sorry. Then his failure to apologize-from her point<br/>
of view, to take responsibility for what he&#39;d done and express remorse<br/>
at having hurt her-would continue to irritate rather than healed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t say this, but because women in our culture have<br/>
traditionally had lower status than men, a behavior, apologizing, that<br/>
is a bit like groveling or surrendering may be more comfortable for us<br/>
than for &quot;higher status&quot; men who may feel any admission of culpability<br/>
is a dangerous admission of weakness.  An admission of weakness could<br/>
potentially lead to a loss of status.  (Myself, I don&#39;t worry about my<br/>
status much.)<br/>
<br/>
Am I off topic, or can we circle this back to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Treating our kids like &quot;real people&quot; and not like they have &quot;low<br/>
status&quot; because they are young can, I think, make the transition to<br/>
having strong adult-adult relationships easier.<br/>

not apologizing, just feeling bad that xxx happenned&quot;.<br/>
I haven&#39;t found a good substitute in English for &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
sorry&quot; for some situations -like if my son bumps his<br/>
head, or some outing was cancelled because of weather.<br/>
In my native tongue (Marathi) it would&#39;ve been an<br/>
exclamation, something between &quot;uh oh&quot; and &quot;alas&quot;. <br/>

Maybe we can start a campaign to increase the use of &quot;alas&quot; in English.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe sometimes we just want to say &quot;Oh, sweetie, how can I help?&quot;<br/>
instead of apologizing.<br/>
