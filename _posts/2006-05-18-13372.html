<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843823189">When I first joined this list 3 years ago and had just started our venture<br/>
into unschooling, I was shocked and offended at having all my nice neat<br/>
little packaged ideas pulled into question.  &quot;How *dare* &#39;that woman&#39;<br/>
question the way I am raising MY children!&quot;  (I never actually said that,<br/>
but I thought it several times :-)  )  But then the next time that I was in<br/>
a similar situation with my children I remembered &quot;that woman&#39;s&quot; words and<br/>
it made me look at what I was doing differently.  Slowly I started to change<br/>
not only what I was doing with my children, but also how I looked at life in<br/>
general.  I&#39;m still not perfect (anyone care to claim that title?  LOL!)<br/>
but I think I have a better understanding of unschooling and how to live a<br/>
joyful life.<br/>
<br/>
When your ideas and thoughts are brought into question, remember that those<br/>
who have been on this unschooling path longer are just trying to help you<br/>
see things from an unschooling perspective.  I know that my perspective has<br/>
changed.<br/>

unschooling.com boards when DS was a toddler (we knew that <br/>
academically we&#39;d be unschooling - didn&#39;t know how much more there <br/>
was), more than once I &quot;stomped off&quot; irritated at something, at <br/>
some &quot;assumption&quot; of mine that had gotten questioned. I&#39;d go to DH <br/>
and say &quot;Can you believe that &#39;they&#39; said this?&quot; But, in the process <br/>
of summarizing and recounting the thread, we&#39;d start discussing the <br/>
topic and batting around the ideas being proposed and slowly by <br/>
slowly, some things seemed to make more sense and slowly by slowly <br/>
we&#39;d put them in practice and hey, the world&#39;s still revolving.<br/>
