<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414859942">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I consulted my 12 year old son on this - he&#39;s an Xbox expert!<br/>
<br/>
His advice:<br/>
<br/>
Definitely get a second Xbox (easy for him to say and when we suggested<br/>
getting one for his 9 yr old brother who never gets  a lookin he said it was<br/>
a waste of money!)<br/>
<br/>
Get the 2 younger boys to play multi player games together on the 2nd Xbox<br/>
<br/>
He believes there will only be an overheating problem if it&#39;s left on for 40<br/>
hrs - he often plays his all daylong and we have not had the ring of fire<br/>
problem<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803941991">My 15 is a huge XBox gamer. We got his XBox in October of 2007 and it was  <br/>
almost 3 years old when he got the ring of death. I think they have made  <br/>
them a bit less likely to get it since then and they did the repair for  <br/>
free. Granted he was antsy waiting but it didn&#39;t take too terribly long.  <br/>
They sell fans for them and it helps so does making sure it isn&#39;t closed in  <br/>
an entertainment center or in direct sunlight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046624141">We got the ring of death & it was still under warranty. We sent it to in to<br/>
be fixed...I think it was gone about three weeks. We haven&#39;t had a problem<br/>
since & they even extended our warranty for an additional amount of time.<br/>
