<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834419791">DS has already said, at 10 yrs old, that he plans to unschool his kids.<br/>
I&#39;ve discussed with him that his someday partner will have a say in it.<br/>
He&#39;s said that if he marries someone who has a good job, then he can<br/>
stay home and unschool the kids - no gender stereotypes there, he&#39;s used<br/>
to me working and DH staying home with him. Not only does DH handle the<br/>
yard work and taking out the trash and home repair stuff, but he ALSO<br/>
grinds the grain to make the flour to make the most awesome baked goods<br/>
(bread, bagels, crackers, pasta, pizza...) and cooks excellent meals,<br/>
does the laundry and the dishes, is an A1 gamer and enjoys playing with<br/>
DS on various games/systems, etc. And he&#39;s MINE all MINE and you can&#39;t<br/>
have him LOL!<br/>
