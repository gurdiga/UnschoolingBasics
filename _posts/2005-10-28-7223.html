<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294440292">Hi Joanne,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list.  I&#39;m new to unschooling too and<br/>
we are not into radical unschooling yet, I have much<br/>
to learn and need hubby on board yet with that. <br/>
However, I did receive a bit of information for a<br/>
couple of your issues at unschoolingdiscussion@yahoo. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling doesn&#39;t mean to allow the child to<br/>
run you down and run the house.  Also, Sandra Dodd had<br/>
mentioned to another mother that when one begins this<br/>
journey that things should be eased into, rather than<br/>
go (my words not hers :-)  Whole Hog)  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think that five is too young to stay up<br/>
until all hours of the night, and that isn&#39;t what<br/>
radical unschooling is about either.  It is about<br/>
respect and love and trust, not about giving up<br/>
control over your child and instead allowing them to<br/>
control you...KWIM?  It appears that this is what has<br/>
happened when I read your posts.  It&#39;s okay that he<br/>
stays up later but I&#39;m sure that most would agree here<br/>
that because this was &quot;boom&quot; things are this way now,<br/>
instead of steady pace of transition.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the horse lessons, does he want to take them? <br/>
If not, drop them.  However, if he does, then you<br/>
shouldn&#39;t have to coax him to get up and then deal<br/>
with him being grumpy.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to offer some great advice that would give<br/>
you peace right away but I do not feel it&#39;s<br/>
appropriate to do so.  Many here have done natural<br/>
parenting from the get go and can give far better<br/>
advice.  Also, there are people here that weren&#39;t<br/>
radical, who eased into letting go of control steadily<br/>
and easily. <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you<br/>
Sandy Winn <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Want to clarify that I wasn&#39;t referring to Sandra<br/>
speaking about doing an eased transition into<br/>
unschooling school :-)  This was a transition into<br/>
radical unschooling and parenting.  In particular, I<br/>
believe it had to do with sleeping.  However, in that<br/>
case, the children were being noisy all night long and<br/>
keeping the parents up.  If your son is not bothering<br/>
you, then I&#39;m probably wrong in the advice<br/>
given...IOW...ignore me!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Learning,<br/>
