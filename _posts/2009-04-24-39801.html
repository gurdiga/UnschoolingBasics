<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288369993">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I know this was discussed in January but my son just recently switched to the American server for WOW.  He is 16 is looking for unschool/homeschoolers to play with.  I was wanting to know what servers/realms people are on so I can forward the info to him so he can find them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

a few years ago.  It&#39;s passed through a few guild masters, Patrick,  <br/>
Adli, DJ, Dave, me, John, and many of us and lots of new players are  <br/>

I&#39;m on Takulah right now, if anyone catches this in time and wants an  <br/>
invite to the guild.<br/>

<br/>
P.S. Sometimes I raise my fist to the air and cuss at Patrick for  <br/>
creating this on an RP-PvP server!  (When I get ganked by the  <br/>
opposing faction.)  And other times I send a thank you out to him,  <br/>
because it&#39;s opened some doors for us to be quick on our fingers :-)  <br/>
and we&#39;ve had some fun opportunities for some serious role-playing.<br/>
