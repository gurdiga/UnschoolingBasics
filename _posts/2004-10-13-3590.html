&gt; is &quot;bad&quot; and this gives me pause; it may not be necessary or ideal for<br/>
&gt; every child but you know what? I loved college, personally. So I think<br/>
&gt; it is important to allow the child to chose, rather than specifically<br/>
&gt; discouraging academic or non-academic pursuits.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the important thing is what a child wants to do in life.  I have met several artists who went to college to get a &quot;degree&quot; and said that it was 4 wasted years in their lives.  They learned squat that they didn&#39;t already know or they felt hindered by artistic limitations.  I went to college for 5 years to study theatre arts and vocal music.  I hated every subject except my theatre, music and psychology classes.  Of course I also hated how those other subjects were taught (memorizations of long lists of historical dates or respewing literature professor&#39;s own words back to him with no room for free-thought).  My own xh is a professional without ever having stepped foot inside an institute of &quot;higher learning.&quot;  He is one of the smartest people I know.  All self-taught.  <br/>
<br/>
Now having said that, I think it is important for children to have realistic expectations.  They can&#39;t be a doctor (in today&#39;s society) without going to college and medical school (and serving an internship).  They will have a hard time becoming a librarian without an MLS.  Higher learning is probably needed for someone who wants to go into some science field.  <br/>
<br/>
I would love to see colleges or &quot;institutes of higher learning&quot; that catered to individuals rather than masses.  For instance colleges of music that teach music to musicians rather than history, science, math, literature, and physical education.  Colleges that teach dance to dancers.  Universities of science to scientists.  etc.  And many of these fields could be combined.  We just need to rethink how we teach.  I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to saying, &quot;You need X number of field related credits and 3-5 classes outside your field.&quot;  But not say, &quot;Oh you have to have 9 credits of history and 12 of literature and 6 of foreign language and 6 of psychology and mathematics at least up through calculus (I have never had to figure out the co-sine of anything since college!) and 12 in science to be a theatre major who wants to specialize in singing, acting and dancing.  Blech!  <br/>

Your children are probably right where they need to be for comprehension.  My kids understand concepts of mathematics better than some of their schooled counterparts.  And although it is one of my own fearful spots (what if my children don&#39;t get math!) I&#39;ve tried to not get anxious because even my 6yo understand multiplication even if he doesn&#39;t know what multiplication is or what the &quot;tables&quot; are.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, teeth-brushing isn&#39;t an option in our house.  I have no guarantees that my kids got my xh&#39;s teeth rather than my teeth.  My xh is 39 and has never had a cavity in his life!  Doesn&#39;t even get plaque!  I&#39;m 40 and currently am missing 3 teeth that I am in the process of having fixed.  Not from lack of brushing.  I have wonderful dental hygeine.  I have horrible dental genes.  I have gorgeous gums (according to my dentist).  My teeth are just brittle and break easily.  I actually have better teeth than my mom and my grandmother had full dentures by the time she was my age!  <br/>

&gt; ready as your average community college freshman, math problems and<br/>
&gt; all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which doesn&#39;t say much for your average community college freshman&#39;s previous educational experience.  :-)  Think how much more ready your son will be in 2 more years.  And in 2 years he may even have an idea of what he wants to focus on.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who has had 6 kids.  3 homeschooled and 3 that went to school at various times in their lives.  Not one child went directly from &quot;high school&quot; to college.  They all took a few years and went an experienced the world.  One kid did missionary work and today is in her last year of seminary to become a UU minister.  Another took odd jobs and opened her own health food store (which is doing well) and is a midwife apprentice.  Another spent 2 years doing odd jobs and saved every penny he had and went touring Europe.  He came home fluent in French and German and now supports himself through his art, tutoring kids in foreign language and playing the guitar.  2 more eventually went to college and did well because they knew what they wanted to do.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not so sure that many 18yo&#39;s know what their passion may be and I also don&#39;t think that 4 years of &quot;higher education&quot; will help them decide.  There is so much pressure to declare your major and get your coursework started.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759861723">I agree with much of this, actually. What I like about college is the<br/>
ability to meander through areas of knowledge. Much of that is<br/>
defeated if one takes the attitude that no, I can&#39;t take Native<br/>
American philosophy because I already have my elective for the year :)<br/>
Or whatever. But this is an attitude of the student, not necessarily<br/>
of the institution. I mean, the library is there. Nobody is going to<br/>
tell you you can only take out books that apply to your major.<br/>
<br/>
To answer the specific question about math, a 14yo who has a sound<br/>
grasp of basic math but is a bit hazy on multiplication of fractions<br/>
and feels no need to get beyond very simple algebra (2x=4) is behind<br/>
in my opinion, not only with respect to where he would be in ps but<br/>
also with relation to his very advanced skills in other areas. And<br/>
yes, to say that he is at approximately the level of the average<br/>
college freshman says more about the average college freshman than it<br/>
does about his level of skill :)<br/>
<br/>
At the time I had these discussions, I was concerned that he was<br/>
spending too much time on fundamentally sterile pursuits (Adult Swim,<br/>
Grand Theft Auto) and noticed that he seemed quite interested in my<br/>
graduate classes the couple of times I took him along.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have already addressed the spelling thing elsewhere. While I<br/>
am as capable of a typo as the next person, it bothers me when people<br/>
who don&#39;t seem to know or care how to use language are the only<br/>
resource their children have for learning this. I think it&#39;s only fair<br/>
to the child to do a frank self-assessment and make resources<br/>
available in areas which are not our strengths.<br/>

kids&#39; only resource for learning to use language?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And - do you think unschooling parents don&#39;t do that because they are <br/>

<br/>
Your first post started out defensively: &quot;Please note that I am not <br/>
interested in<br/>
suggestions on how to unschool in a politically correct manner; what<br/>
we do works for us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is no such thing as &quot;politically correct unschooling&quot; and your <br/>
use of that phrase was an insult and most people here undoubtedly <br/>
recognized it as such, but chose to ignore it and respond to the <br/>
content of your post anyway.<br/>
<br/>
However, you also said that you&#39;ve been told that you&#39;re not an <br/>
unschooler and, given your focus on your child being &quot;behind&quot; in math, <br/>
you&#39;re right that it doesn&#39;t sound like an unschooling approach. So - <br/>
I&#39;m curious about what it is that makes you want to label yourself as <br/>
an unschooler? Why does that matter to you? What you do works for you. <br/>
You said so yourself. That&#39;s great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-80304924">Pam<br/>
<br/>
Why does it matter to you what I call myself? I subscribe to the list.<br/>
Opinions were asked and I gave mine. Gave it, knowing that certain<br/>
people would get all bent out of shape over it.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, it is not you that I am criticizing, and I know<br/>
nothing about you. As far as I know the people I am thinking of do not<br/>
subscribe to this list.<br/>
<br/>
But here is the heart of the problem for me. When a discussion arose<br/>
of why (in a certain person&#39;s opinion) so many blacks were lazy and<br/>
preferred to go on welfare rather than get a job, she would not even<br/>
look at statistics that said otherwise. Because she was a radical<br/>
unschooler, and I guess that in her worldview statistics were<br/>
schoolish stuff.<br/>
<br/>
This person lives on an isolated farm in Ohio. I know from discussions<br/>
of the portfolio she turned in (Ohio requirement) that her children&#39;s<br/>
exposure to math for the year was limited to the measurements involved<br/>
in building a deck. Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Pardon me if I find this a bit light for teenagers. Frankly, I think<br/>
those children are being ill-served. Yeah, they could be equally<br/>
ill-served in a public school. Yeah yeah yeah, this is schoolish<br/>
concern for the level where they should be, sure. But if and when<br/>
those children become interested in academic pursuits they will have<br/>
several years of work to do if they want to major in anything but<br/>
English. Why limit their possibilities?<br/>
<br/>
This is not a flaw of unschooling per se, but of how certain people<br/>
use it. I do think that their are things you should learn whose<br/>
usefulness is not immediately apparent. Like algebra. So I disagree<br/>
with those who would have the educational enterprise be entirely<br/>
child-directed. Child driven, sure, but parent guided is what works<br/>
for use.<br/>
<br/>
What I am saying is directed to the woman who asked for opinions, and<br/>
all I am saying is -- there is a hole there. For those who are<br/>
unfamiliar with the quotation, it goes something like this:<br/>
<br/>
I was walking down the street and I fell into a hole<br/>
Some people came and saw me and they helped me get out of that hole.<br/>
A few days later I was walking down the street<br/>
I fell into that hole again and again someone helped me get out<br/>
And then<br/>
I was walking down the street and I fell in the hole again<br/>
I could not believe I fell in that hole again<br/>
When I looked at the walls of the hole I saw how to get out<br/>
When I got out of the hole, I saw some people<br/>
I warned them about the hole<br/>
The next day I walked down a different street.<br/>
<br/>
This quote may not quite apply to this particular situation as I don&#39;t<br/>
believe that I have been in this hole myself, but I like this<br/>
quotation, and that is what I am doing -- pointing out a hazard. There<br/>
is no reason to let fear of this hazard rule our lives or keep us from<br/>
teaching our children as we see fit. But if the hazard seems like a<br/>
danger into which we might fall...perhaps we should take heed and um,<br/>
maybe bring a ladder or a rope.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, if you&#39;d like to nitpick over typos or tell me that I am not<br/>
doing this properly, please feel free. I don&#39;t think I have much<br/>
respect for your opinion though. You take things as personal attacks<br/>
when they aren&#39;t meant to be and retaliate unnecessarily.<br/>
<br/>
Be well and be happy<br/>
Dana<br/>

&gt; and who keep their kids in a bubble where they are their kids&#39; only<br/>
&gt; resource.  Are you seriously saying that unschooling parents ARE their<br/>
&gt; kids&#39; only resource for learning to use language?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  I think it&#39;s only fair<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the child to do a frank self-assessment and make resources<br/>
&gt; &gt; available in areas which are not our strengths.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And - do you think unschooling parents don&#39;t do that because they are<br/>
&gt; bad spellers?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your first post started out defensively: &quot;Please note that I am not<br/>
&gt; interested in<br/>
&gt; suggestions on how to unschool in a politically correct manner; what<br/>
&gt; we do works for us.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is no such thing as &quot;politically correct unschooling&quot; and your<br/>
&gt; use of that phrase was an insult and most people here undoubtedly<br/>
&gt; recognized it as such, but chose to ignore it and respond to the<br/>
&gt; content of your post anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, you also said that you&#39;ve been told that you&#39;re not an<br/>
&gt; unschooler and, given your focus on your child being &quot;behind&quot; in math,<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re right that it doesn&#39;t sound like an unschooling approach. So -<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m curious about what it is that makes you want to label yourself as<br/>
&gt; an unschooler? Why does that matter to you? What you do works for you.<br/>
&gt; You said so yourself. That&#39;s great.<br/>

something I want to be heaping onto my kids.  So if I have an urge <br/>
to make someone do math, instead of acting on that urge I immerse <br/>
myself in unschooling forums (or listen to Pam&#39;s math tapes- thanks <br/>
Pam) until the urge passes and I&#39;ve come to my senses.<br/>
Are you interested in learning more about unschooling?  Or have you <br/>

list pretty regularly talk about the question of &quot;child-driven&quot; and <br/>
there are quite a few of us who don&#39;t care for that description of <br/>
unschooling because it seems to imply that parents are on the <br/>
sidelines, watching.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I don&#39;t think algebra is important for everyone. I think it <br/>
is a waste of time for many. I&#39;m an econometrician, myself, and love <br/>
mathematics and use algebra a lot. But it is just a tool and not one <br/>
that is useful to everybody.<br/>
<br/>
About you being in on discussions of another family&#39;s portfolio, that <br/>
strikes me as very strange - why would you be privy to that <br/>
information? Are you the evaluator? Is that not confidential <br/>
information?  Unschoolers will usually turn in the minimum amount of <br/>
documentation necessary to satisfy requirements - what is put in a <br/>
required portfolio does not remotely indicate the full scope of what is <br/>
really going on in their homes.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids who haven&#39;t learned algebra or other kinds of math are <br/>
not behind, they&#39;re just busy with other things. They are learning <br/>
something all the time. There is no timetable for life outside of <br/>
school - nothing says that they have to learn algebra by 18. My <br/>
experience is that when they needed to learn it for their own purposes, <br/>
it came easily to them. And my oldest has taken college math and <br/>
statistics courses and gotten As, without ever having done one minute <br/>
of any kind of math program before that.<br/>

&quot;I will research Jewish literature&quot; but rather to stumble across some<br/>
while looking for a copy of the Blessing Way or a book about Japanese<br/>
woodcuts :)<br/>
<br/>
who says you have to graduate? Not me, that&#39;s for sure :)<br/>
<br/>
And why would you use algebra? Gee :) How many pizzas do we have to<br/>
buy so that each of nine people gets three slices? I can&#39;t believe I<br/>
am explaining this :)<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d use algebra to determine where supply and demand curves meet if<br/>
you wanted to set an optimum price for your product. If you had the<br/>
tools, you&#39;d be a little better off using calculus.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d use calculus to find a better way to render 3-d graphics, either<br/>
on the hardware or the software end.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d use summation to calculate the beta or volatility of a given stock.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention what you would use to make the next leap in quantum<br/>
computing -- a little over my head -- but an eigenvalue, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are growth curves in biology and microbiology....velocities<br/>
and orbits of planets, ballistics (bound to be a growth field if Bush<br/>
is re-elected) and good old plain vanilla chemical reactions and<br/>
circuit theory.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure that there are those out there saying yuck pooey what if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to learn all that? Ah, but what if he does? And what if<br/>
he does but doesn&#39;t know it yet?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all. And now I am outta here :) <br/>

&gt; I was describing schools, not my own learning theories, so<br/>
&gt; your &quot;schoolish&quot; accusation is nonsensical.<br/>
&gt; Colleges have requirements for graduation, at least the ones that I<br/>

&gt; A tool for what?  Really, I&#39;m curious.  I know lots of busy,<br/>
&gt; productive people and I can&#39;t think of one that uses an algebra<br/>
&gt; curriculum as a life tool.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; good! why is everyone feeling the need to justify their particular<br/>
&gt; situation?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re missing the point- on purpose, I think.<br/>
&gt; You insisted that an unschooling child with a poorly spelling parent<br/>
&gt; must be exposed to alternate spelling resources.<br/>
&gt; I was pointing out the many different sources of correct spelling<br/>
&gt; children are exposed to just in daily living.<br/>
&gt; So what did *you* mean exactly by an alternate source, if not some<br/>
&gt; sort of spelling curriculum?<br/>

You said &quot;what I like about college is being able to meander through <br/>

Barnes and Noble, or a mall, or a museum, or any other number of <br/>

you had zero interest in all because they were certain you really <br/>

why anyone would feel the need to use a curriculum in order to learn <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-159466676">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;This person lives on an isolated farm in Ohio. I know from discussions<br/>
of the portfolio she turned in (Ohio requirement) that her children&#39;s<br/>
exposure to math for the year was limited to the measurements involved<br/>
in building a deck. Wow.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did you see the portfolio? Did she include every minute of the year in the<br/>
portfolio? How fancy was the deck? Do they till, sow, fertilize and reap on<br/>
her farm? Is it a commercial concern with produce being sold? Do they pay<br/>
taxes? Buy groceries and animal feed? Pay bills? Have cel phones with<br/>
numbers of minutes? Are they on the electricity grid or do they make their<br/>
own power? Do they collect eggs from their own chickens? Are they on line?<br/>
DO THEY MAKE COOKIES?<br/>
<br/>
You seem to be missing the point of life experience based learning, which is<br/>
that everything is a learning situation. Unfortunately some States force<br/>
Unschoolers to have to contrive &quot;educationese&quot; out of their daily living.<br/>
Often the recommendation is only to record the minimum required, rather than<br/>
give the States the opportunity to increase regulations. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; So I disagree<br/>
with those who would have the educational enterprise be entirely<br/>
child-directed. Child driven, sure, but parent guided is what works<br/>
for use.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You have already said that people don&#39;t consider you an unschooling family.<br/>
The people who are Unschooling here, and on the sister lists, are engaging<br/>
in a child directed educational lifestyle with great success. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I was walking down the street and I fell into a hole<br/>
Some people came and saw me and they helped me get out of that hole.<br/>
A few days later I was walking down the street<br/>
I fell into that hole again and again someone helped me get out<br/>
And then I was walking down the street and I fell in the hole again<br/>
I could not believe I fell in that hole again<br/>
When I looked at the walls of the hole I saw how to get out<br/>
When I got out of the hole, I saw some people<br/>
I warned them about the hole<br/>
The next day I walked down a different street.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HUH??<br/>
So you are quoting some story about some individual who is too stupid to<br/>
stay out of the same hole days in a row, and it is relevant how? I don&#39;t see<br/>
the analogy. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;This quote may not quite apply to this particular situation as I don&#39;t<br/>
believe that I have been in this hole myself, but I like this<br/>
quotation, and that is what I am doing -- pointing out a hazard.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No you are not pointing out a hazard. You have simply been saying, in<br/>
increasingly barbed and offensive ways, that we must be neglecting our<br/>
children&#39;s educations, and now that we are too stupid to stay out of an<br/>
imaginary hole.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to Unschool then don&#39;t. I&#39;m sure you and your kids are<br/>
leading a perfectly happy life. However this is a list for people who DO<br/>
want to learn about Unschooling. The &quot;hazard&quot; you are talking about, and I&#39;m<br/>
still not clear on what that is, is not real in the experience of people who<br/>
are Unschooling. Some of the long time Unschoolers freely giving up their<br/>
time and energy here have been doing it for over 20 years. Their children<br/>
are grown and almost grown. If you can&#39;t learn something about Unschooling<br/>
from the people here, you can at least refrain from telling us how little<br/>
respect you have for us. <br/>

it is when people are excessively worried about offending others in <br/>

You are giving advice on a list called: &quot;Unschooling Basics&quot; and I <br/>
think, yes, you are implying that you are giving unschooling advice. <br/>
Talking about kids being &quot;behind&quot; in math is most definitely <br/>
school-talk and it is confusing and misleading to pass that off as <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; advice.<br/>

  &gt; What I like about life is the ability to meander through areas of<br/>
  &gt; knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
  yadda yadda yadda. I am not exposed to jewish literature, say, in my<br/>
  daily life. I have found a lot of really wonderful things browsing in<br/>
  college libraries.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; It *is* the attitude of the institution if there is only room in the<br/>
  &gt; course load for a certain number of electives with the rest being<br/>
  &gt; filled by requirements.<br/>
<br/>
  so the student can select another major, take a few more classes than<br/>
  four, or gee, take a little longer to graduate. Who&#39;s being schoolish<br/>
  now? You don&#39;t have to follow the catalog, you kow.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; It seems to me that worrying about being on the level of same age<br/>
  &gt; public school students is really not at all conducive to<br/>
  &gt; unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
  Well see, my primary goal is not unschooling actually, but helping my<br/>
  children grow. So whatever.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Are you interested in learning more about unschooling?  Or have you<br/>
  &gt; already decided it&#39;s not for you?  (In which case I&#39;m really curious<br/>
  &gt; why you&#39;re on this list...)<br/>
<br/>
  You get your email in reverse order too, don&#39;t you. I am not trying to<br/>
  be sarcastic, but I have already answered this one several times and I<br/>
  have a life to get to :)<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; What do you mean by &quot;fundamentally sterile pursuits&quot;?<br/>
  &gt; And how is Grand Theft Auto &quot;fundamentally sterile&quot; while, say,<br/>
  &gt; algebra is not?<br/>
<br/>
  Algebra is a tool. Grand theft auto is not. If that doesn&#39;t help then<br/>
  I am sorry, I don&#39;t have the time.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; So let&#39;s say I&#39;m not a good speller (actually I am, but whatever).<br/>
<br/>
  k...<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Are you thinking that as an unschooling mother my kids don&#39;t come<br/>
  &gt; into contact with anyone else&#39;s spelling? <br/>
<br/>
  in the particular case I was thinking of, maybe not. <br/>
<br/>
  My children are<br/>
  &gt; surrounded by print- from our mail, to our books, to our magazines,<br/>
  &gt; to the internet, to their video games and more. <br/>
<br/>
  good! why is everyone feeling the need to justify their particular situation?<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Unless what you mean by &quot;resource&quot; is an enforced spelling<br/>
  &gt; curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
  Nope. I don&#39;t enforce spelling. My daughter does it on her own. Math<br/>
  on the other hand...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922506806">***...her children&#39;s exposure to math for the year was limited to the<br/>
measurements involved<br/>

 Pardon me if I find this a bit light for teenagers. ***<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s possible her kids also played games, figured the cost of<br/>
merchandise they wanted, purchased items, counted change, divided food<br/>
portions, cooked, etc.   She may not have noted in the &quot;health and<br/>
fitness&quot; portion of her portfolio that her children were breathing and<br/>
eating, but I&#39;ll wager they were. <br/>
<br/>
***This is not a flaw of unschooling per se, but of how certain people<br/>
use it. ***<br/>
<br/>
This is the strength of unschooling and the strength of the people who<br/>
understand it.   People learn.  They&#39;re learning all the time.  If<br/>
they&#39;re not learning math notation it&#39;s because they&#39;re not needing math<br/>
notation. <br/>
<br/>
***I do think that their are things you should learn whose<br/>
usefulness is not immediately apparent.***<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling parents understand their children are learning all<br/>
the time though the usefulness of what they&#39;re learning is not always<br/>
immediately apparent. <br/>
<br/>
***Like algebra. ***<br/>
<br/>
If a person discovers they need algebra they can learn algebra.  <br/>
<br/>
***So I disagree with those who would have the educational enterprise be<br/>
entirely child-directed. Child driven, sure, but parent guided is what<br/>
works<br/>
for use.***<br/>
<br/>
I think we understand you disagree with trusting children to learn and<br/>
that you know it won&#39;t work for you.  But I&#39;m not interested in what<br/>
&quot;works&quot; in regards to education.  I&#39;m interested in my son having the<br/>
opportunity to live the life he loves.  I&#39;m interested in him trusting<br/>
his own decisions and trusting his ability.   My son is not in pursuit of<br/>
an educational enterprise, he&#39;s living life.  He&#39;s learning all the time,<br/>
but not because he has been made to believe he must get educated.  He&#39;s<br/>
learning because it would be impossible for him to not learn.   When he<br/>
needed to talk he talked.  When he needed to walk he walked.  When he<br/>
needed to read he read.  I have witnessed twelve years of constant<br/>
learning and have no doubt he can and will learn whatever he decides he<br/>
needs.   I&#39;m available to provide him with resources, support, ideas,<br/>
assistance, etc. <br/>
<br/>
It is very possible he doesn&#39;t know at this moment that when he&#39;s twenty<br/>
five he will want to know how to put a new engine in his Jeep . <br/>
But by that time he will have had twenty five years of learning<br/>
experience, of understanding he is capable of learning anything he wants<br/>
to learn and he will learn how to put a new engine in his Jeep.   I could<br/>
take up his time today and for then next week with engine repair<br/>
instruction but how do I know what might be depriving him of by forcing<br/>
him to do something else, isn&#39;t the very thing he would need to know when<br/>
he was twenty four?<br/>
I can&#39;t look at the life of any other individual on the planet and know<br/>
what they will need in ten or twelve years.  I certainly can&#39;t know that<br/>
for my son.   If anyone has any idea it will be him.  <br/>

year did they use that experience,for math??one experiment can go a long way <br/>

my 2 cents worth.....<br/>
i,like many have gained alot of wisdom from valerie,ren,and others that have <br/>
done this before.there are always exceptions with anything ,,,but THEY prove <br/>
to me ,by doing it &#39;&#39;right&#39;&#39;,,that they are on to something here,,,<br/>
im not an unschooler by definition....but  i am alot more relaxed at it than <br/>
i used to be ,,more of an ecletic/relaxed/leaning heavy toward <br/>
unschooling....but i am willing to learn from others..and have..<br/>

&gt; &gt; What I like about life is the ability to meander through areas of<br/>
&gt; &gt; knowledge.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; yadda yadda yadda. I am not exposed to jewish literature, say, in my<br/>
&gt; daily life. I have found a lot of really wonderful things browsing in<br/>
&gt; college libraries.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It *is* the attitude of the institution if there is only room in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; course load for a certain number of electives with the rest being<br/>
&gt; &gt; filled by requirements.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; so the student can select another major, take a few more classes than<br/>
&gt; four, or gee, take a little longer to graduate. Who&#39;s being schoolish<br/>
&gt; now? You don&#39;t have to follow the catalog, you kow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that worrying about being on the level of same age<br/>
&gt; &gt; public school students is really not at all conducive to<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well see, my primary goal is not unschooling actually, but helping my<br/>
&gt; children grow. So whatever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Are you interested in learning more about unschooling?  Or have you<br/>
&gt; &gt; already decided it&#39;s not for you?  (In which case I&#39;m really curious<br/>
&gt; &gt; why you&#39;re on this list...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You get your email in reverse order too, don&#39;t you. I am not trying to<br/>
&gt; be sarcastic, but I have already answered this one several times and I<br/>
&gt; have a life to get to :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What do you mean by &quot;fundamentally sterile pursuits&quot;?<br/>
&gt; &gt; And how is Grand Theft Auto &quot;fundamentally sterile&quot; while, say,<br/>
&gt; &gt; algebra is not?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Algebra is a tool. Grand theft auto is not. If that doesn&#39;t help then<br/>
&gt; I am sorry, I don&#39;t have the time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So let&#39;s say I&#39;m not a good speller (actually I am, but whatever).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; k...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Are you thinking that as an unschooling mother my kids don&#39;t come<br/>
&gt; &gt; into contact with anyone else&#39;s spelling?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; in the particular case I was thinking of, maybe not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  My children are<br/>
&gt; &gt; surrounded by print- from our mail, to our books, to our magazines,<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the internet, to their video games and more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; good! why is everyone feeling the need to justify their particular situation?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Unless what you mean by &quot;resource&quot; is an enforced spelling<br/>
&gt; &gt; curriculum.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nope. I don&#39;t enforce spelling. My daughter does it on her own. Math<br/>
&gt; on the other hand...<br/>
