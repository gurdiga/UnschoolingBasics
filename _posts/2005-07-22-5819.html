<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503529411">Would anyone that has a personal story to share about how unschooling <br/>
has promoted personal or family healing please email me?<br/>
<br/>
We had discussed it here briefly a few months ago, but I&#39;d really love <br/>
some personal stories I could use for an article I have yet to write!! <br/>
I am trying to find our old conversation in the archives, but with <br/>
limited library time I am finding it hard to search  (maybe someone <br/>
knows which post #&#39;s they are?)<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t mind taking the time to share, please write here or to my <br/>
email addy. I would love to use quotes, but am happy to keep your name <br/>
anonymous if you are uncomfortable having your name published. <br/>
<br/>
So how has unschooling healed you?<br/>
How has unschooling healed your family?<br/>
Is there extended family that has found healing through your <br/>
unschooling/gentle parenting philosophies?<br/>
<br/>
Please share your journeys and enlightenment.:)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Ren</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-409159246">Ren - I have a bunch of posts about unschooling and healing - from late <br/>
February to early March -- is that what you&#39;re looking for? I think it <br/>
starts on 2/27/05.<br/>
<br/>
I can forward them, one at a time - whatever is easiest for you.<br/>
