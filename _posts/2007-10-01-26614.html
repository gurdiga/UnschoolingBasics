<div id="ygrps-yiv-494575612">Hi, I&#39;m Cindy and I lurk but rarely post.  So here goes....<br/>
<br/>
Son (13) and I are deschooling.  Son loves his XBox, he loves military<br/>
history, and he loves the history channel.  So imagine my delight when<br/>
in his interest of the Civil War, he played an Xbox Civil War game<br/>
(produced by the History Channel) till he beat it, then by choice went<br/>
with me to the library and we checked out tons of books on the civil war.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine even more my delight, when I asked, &quot;Just what actually makes<br/>
the musket ball shoot?  I mean, how does the gun powder make it do<br/>
that?&quot; and son explained it to me.  <br/>
<br/>
For all the doubting Thomas&#39; out there, (myself at times included),<br/>
son is learning, we&#39;re both having fun and everyone wins.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share some happy stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Cindy</div>
