<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576164981">We are interested in unschooling and are trying a couple new things <br/>
with our five year son.  One is to lift off constraints and allow <br/>
him to make his own decisions.  He now wants to stay up very late <br/>
either watching movies or playing on the computer.  I explained that <br/>
he could make that choice but I needed to go to bed.  He said he was <br/>
afraid to be alone.  We went back and forth with our seemingly <br/>
conflicting needs.  The first night I read in his bed next to the <br/>
room where he watches TV.  Later I told him I was tired and he was <br/>
willing put out the light so I could sleep and went back to his <br/>
movie.  When he was ready he woke me up and we went back to the <br/>
family bed where my husband was already sleeping. I was pretty <br/>
delighted at that point.  The second night he wanted to play the <br/>
computer after his first movie.  I got up put on the computer.  The <br/>
repetition of the noise on the computer made it hard for me to relax <br/>
and fall asleep.  I got up and explained that to him, we decided to <br/>
turn down the volume really low.  At around 11:30, I thought to <br/>
myself, why am I doing this?  He is free and now I am trapped!!  I <br/>
am in his bed so he can stay up, I can&#39;t sleep and I am tired!  But <br/>
still trying to allow him more freedom I decided to delay my needs <br/>
and give it some more time.  Last night I explained that the <br/>
computer noise made it hard for me to sleep.  So he decided that he <br/>
wanted to watch two movies again.  When I explained that I can&#39;t <br/>
stay up he begs me to watch them with him.  He tells me he is afraid <br/>
to be alone.  (I do know that he is afraid of the dark sometimes <br/>
even when I am lying down next to him.)  Then I feel bad.  I don&#39;t <br/>
want to overburden him with my illness but I do have MS and I really <br/>
do need to get enough sleep.  My dh is willing to allow me to try <br/>
unschooling but he is not going to be willing to sit up with him <br/>
every night until midnight either.  How can we give him choices <br/>
while still taking care of ourselves? At the rate we are going I am <br/>
getting pretty tired, pretty quickly.  This level of fatigue then <br/>
compromises my mood the next day and I feel much crankier.  Joanne</div>

Hello fellow Joanne! (I see we spell it the same way also!)<br/>
<br/>
What kind of discussions did you have with your son *before* you <br/>
lifted the bedtime rule and how long did you discuss it? Also, instead <br/>
of just stopping a rule, maybe it might be better to ease up a little <br/>
at a time. I think it&#39;s confusing for children to go from rules and <br/>
controls to none.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722054198">Hi Joanne,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;We are interested in unschooling and are trying a couple new things<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think you need to change all of his habits all at once. And you don&#39;t need to give up your right to sleep for his right to choose to stay awake. It&#39;s all about balance. You need to balance  his freedom of choice  and the needs of other members of the household. Plus you must take into account his age and level of understanding and empathy.<br/>
<br/>
We never had an enforced &quot;bedtime&quot; when my kids were 5. I didn&#39;t send them to bed just because it was 8:00. But I would certainly help them to bed when it seemed the time was right-when they seemed tired or I would soon be too tired to help them. That was just part of our gentle routine. So they were used to me talking about when we were going to bed, did they want help getting into their jammies, etc. That usually resulted in happily getting to bed before 9 or 10. Now that they&#39;re older (11 and 16) they stay up till whenever and handle it all on their own. <br/>
<br/>
Our children shouldn&#39;t be making their choices without consideration for the other people in the house. Some of that understanding comes with age. So you could remove the &quot;you must be in bed by 8:00&quot; part while still not leaving it open for him to challenge himself to stay awake as late as he can. We had routines instead of rules and that seemed to work very well.<br/>

I think I would explain to my son that I am ill and exhausted and that I am going to bed.  I would willingly attempt to problem solve with ways that he can stay up and not feel afraid...but I would not give in on me being in bed asleep.  It is quite possible that he simply isn&#39;t ready to be up by himself and the answer is that he will choose try it when he is older.<br/>

<br/>
Very good point!  Thank you!  I think I was just so excited about unschooling that I jumped in over my head before I learned how to swim :)  JO (Since we both spell out names the same way perhaps I will switch to my initials?)<br/>
