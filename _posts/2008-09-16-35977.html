<div id="ygrps-yiv-830483228">This made me chuckle, cuz it&#39;s like &#39;same question, different scenario&#39;...same answer! :)  I&#39;ve become aware during our own move to mindful parenting and radical unschooling, that coercion can be hidden all over the place, in places that seem to make sense until they are really pulled apart.  Like: you should to at least have to move all this stuff out of the (my!) way so you&#39;re safe.  Which is *our* need, not *theirs*, ya?<br/>

Ask him what if you wanted the garden beds edged and he didn&#39;t care  <br/>
would it teach him to love well edged gardens if you made him do it?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, what if you asked if he&#39;d come out and read to you  <br/>
while you edged? Or asked him to bring some hobby out that he enjoyed  <br/>
to keep you company. What if you asked him to do a small thing as a  <br/>
favor to you, like fix a drooping stake that&#39;s holding up the string  <br/>
you&#39;re using as a guide? What if you were glowing afterwards at how  <br/>
cool everything looked?<br/>
<br/>
Which person is he more likely to feel like lending a hand to edge for?<br/>

Down the right side is a whole section on just chores and lots and  <br/>
lots of common questions and common viewpoints and how and why those  <br/>
viewpoints often create kids who avoid helping.<br/>
<br/>
My 17  yo daughter has been saying &quot;Sure!&quot; to my requests for help  <br/>
since she was 12 or so. (Which coincided with when I could see a more  <br/>
adult view of the world developing in her.) It&#39;s because I *didn&#39;t*  <br/>
make her clean up but asked if she&#39;d help me out.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t, though, always perfect! Occasionally I did have my  <br/>
demanding periods and I could see and feel the difference in her  <br/>
reactions. I could feel her resentment and withdrawal when I made her  <br/>
(when I left cleaning until the last minute before company.) I became  <br/>
someone she wanted to avoid. (And by association, she wanted to avoid  <br/>
what I wanted her to do.) When I retained full control of what I  <br/>
wanted done and asked for her help -- and treated the time she gave  <br/>
me as a gift even if her help wasn&#39;t huge -- I behaved as someone she  <br/>
enjoyed helping.<br/>

&gt; were in<br/>
&gt; the way<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if they&#39;d said no? Would that be okay?<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s asking, yes or no *should* be acceptable answers. Otherwise  <br/>
it&#39;s a demand disguised as a question.<br/>
<br/>
Kids see right through that but unfortunately parents don&#39;t. Parents  <br/>
think they&#39;re being polite by phrasing a demand as a question but  <br/>
it&#39;s really just dishonesty.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and he just wants them to learn to move their things out of the<br/>
&gt; way for safety.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When we impose lessons on someone, they often learn a lesson  <br/>
different from the one we intend. When we make kids clean or just  <br/>
move things for safety, they don&#39;t absorb the sensibleness of the  <br/>
idea. They absorb that when  you&#39;re big you get to make weaker people  <br/>
do what you want. Right now those little people often have to beg and  <br/>
plead and hope that a big person might find their request worthy of  <br/>
the big person&#39;s time. Being able to make someone do what you want --  <br/>
as your husband is modeling for them -- would be a time to look  <br/>
forward to.<br/>
<br/>
Our values -- and we! -- look way more attractive if we put the  <br/>
energy into the values that we feel they&#39;re worth rather than  <br/>
imposing the values on someone else.<br/>
<br/>
What if you valued vegetarianism? For lots of people vegetarianism  <br/>
makes sense. Would he embrace and love and see the sensibleness in  <br/>
vegetarianism if you made him cook vegetarian meals and made him eat  <br/>
vegetarian meals?<br/>
<br/>
What if, instead, you started cooking vegetarian meals for yourself  <br/>
and added meat in for the rest of the family so they could choose  <br/>
vegetarian or not? They could try it occasionally when it felt right  <br/>
to them or not when they didn&#39;t. So they had a *choice*.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But, I suggested that he get down and help them, rather<br/>
&gt; than ordering them to do it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suggest he get down and do it and ask if they&#39;d like to help. And  <br/>
be okay if they say &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Often it helps to make specific requests like &quot;Hey, could you hand me  <br/>
the bin to put these beads in?&quot; Invite them to join in rather than  <br/>
demanding they do it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He says it&#39;s their stuff and they should<br/>
&gt; be the ones at least pushing it to the side.  Thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And Hitler thought Jews and homosexuals and gypsies and Unitarians  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be out in the world weakening the German race. So he made  <br/>
them go to internment camps and made them go into executioners chambers.<br/>
<br/>
When two people disagree, is the best way we can think up to resolve  <br/>
the differences for the stronger side to make the other side comply?  <br/>
*Is* that the way he wants to model resolving conflicts for them?<br/>
<br/>
And a big *huge* factor is that the kids aren&#39;t developmentally ready  <br/>
to see the world through adult eyes. It&#39;s not a matter of not  <br/>
understanding. It&#39;s a matter that they really can&#39;t see the world  <br/>
through the lens he wants them to. They will be able to when they&#39;re  <br/>
older *because* they&#39;re older, not because they&#39;ve been taught.<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe, if they&#39;re precocious, they might grasp the safety factor  <br/>
just as some kids can precociously read at 3. But it doesn&#39;t help  <br/>
them grasp it sooner to assume they should grasp it any more than it  <br/>
will help a 3 yo read by assuming they should be able to just because  <br/>
the neighbor&#39;s child can. Or, even less sensibly, grasp it just  <br/>
because the Dad can at 20+ years old! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, he can live the values he finds important. He can  <br/>
invite them along and make helping him a pleasant time so that they  <br/>
absorb the pleasantness. They&#39;ll have pleasant feelings about the  <br/>
value so that when they&#39;re old enough they&#39;ll be more likely to adopt  <br/>
his values.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-162019211">I apologize if someone already mentioned this (skimmed thread), but we keep a crate for each person.  If someone&#39;s stuff is in my path or whatever, I just stick it in their plastic crate.  Then if they need it, they know where it is, I don&#39;t have to do the extra step of putting it away unless I feel like it or have time to help, and it manages my need for clutter-free spaces.  It&#39;s actually nice for those of use who honestly *believe* (me!) that we don&#39;t leave our clutter around when we *do.*  I&#39;ll think, where is that piece of paper I wrote the note on?  Where&#39;s that magazine I was reading?...Sure enough, in my crate!  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a creative solution that works for us and seems to keep everyone relatively happy.  Sometimes a crate gets full, and I might mention, um, that crate is looking pretty full...but mostly everyone likes to leave room in their crate so they can find missing stuff :)<br/>

<br/>
Is it bothering the children?<br/>
<br/>
As soon as it does, they&#39;ll start moving it aside. Until then, it&#39;s <br/>
just *his* issue.<br/>
<br/>
If he would model the outcome he&#39;d like to see, he will eventually see <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
If things are in the way and not being used, I&#39;d ask whether I could <br/>
move them to a safer place. Then I would carefully move them to a safe <br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
The nice thing about his action is that (when they are older and more <br/>
mature) they will kindly do the same for me when *I* leave something <br/>
out.<br/>
