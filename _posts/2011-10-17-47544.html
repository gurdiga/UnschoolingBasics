Most pubic schools allow homescooled children to partake in some of the classes (they are public schools after all and your taxes are paying for them). Your daughter could just take the art class at public school and nothing else. My daughter goes to the recess at the public school down the road some days.<br/>

as a tool that your daughter is choosing to use to explore the world maybe you <br/>

aren&#39;t useful or valuable. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If she isn&#39;t happy at home or at school you should work to make either of those <br/>
places better for her. What is it she wants from school? Does she want more time <br/>
with other people? Can you get out more each week, each day? Can you go where <br/>
there are more people to be around? Can you get out and about regularly? Can you <br/>
find other things to do in  your community? Other things to be engaged by, other <br/>
connections? Join a  choir or a dance troupe or get involved with volunteering <br/>
at a local  woods or animal shelter or whatever is available? Look for exciting <br/>
and  engaging things that you and she can add to your life instead of  bemoaning <br/>

She says she misses art and you respond by signing her up for art classes? You <br/>

Art is huge and vast and fabulous. Art, like science, is how you see the world. <br/>
What art does she like? Does she like modern art, things like Sarah Lucas&#39; self  <br/>
portraits or Banksy&#39;swonderful public statements on politics and the world? Does <br/>
she know about that arena? You could get Exit Through the Gift Shop and think <br/>
about art as industry, if you wanted, or not.  Could you go looking for art in <br/>
your environment? Find the little filigrees on buildings, the moments when the <br/>
builder broke out of the mould and danced a bit for his or her imagined <br/>
audience?  Can you go to museums and explore art? Can you go walking around <br/>
interesting neighbourhoods and blocks of your city/town and look at <br/>
architectural styles? Have you seen this <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://slinkachu.com/little-people?">http://slinkachu.com/little-people?</a> <br/>
Having seen this I often find spots where I would place little figures when I&#39;m <br/>
in town. Maybe, if that interested your daughter (or you), you could collect <br/>
figures and have a bit of guerrilla art going in and around your local <br/>
town/city. <br/>

<br/>
Linnaea likes to draw. She doesn&#39;t think of herself as an artist, or of her <br/>
drawings as art. But she enjoys drawing and working on getting the aspects of <br/>
the human face correct and she spends a fair bit of time working on it. She <br/>
uploads some of her drawings to a forum she&#39;s on and asks for help with the <br/>
details. For example, she couldn&#39;t figure out how to make it look like a woman <br/>
was sitting and she uploaded her picture and someone came along and downloaded <br/>
it and drew on a few notes and uploaded it and she was able to see how to handle <br/>
that problem and fixed the picture. I was and am impressed with her ability to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474230176">We use the library and I really recommend it as a social venue and basically in place of school because it offers everything that school does (and more) but in a more authentic sense (and the library doesn&#39;t give a child homework!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll grab my laptop and my daughter and I will spend hours there in the late afternoon. There&#39;s so much to do, so many people to chat with, and so much to learn at a library.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765725569">I linked a couple of things in my post. Given your response &quot; having to get on <br/>
to your child every morning to get her up, every  afternoon to do homework and <br/>
every night to go to bed, that&#39;s not the  kind of life anybody would want their <br/>
child to grow up in.  there was to  much arguing, crying, stubborness, etc.&quot; I&#39;m <br/>
guessing that you didn&#39;t read this one: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a> which <br/>
talks about letting a child experience school on their own terms. There is <br/>
usually more than one way to deal with a situation. It may help you to see more <br/>
options. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter is flipping back and forth as frequently as you say she is than <br/>
she isn&#39;t really finding a happy life in either place. In that situation I would <br/>
be looking for ways of making one or the other better, or look for a third <br/>
choice. You say that your rural life is a limiting factor, maybe you need to <br/>
address that aspect. We live in a rural location but go into town regularly and <br/>
have found local activities to engage with. The UK&#39;s rural is distinctly <br/>
different from the US, but when I&#39;ve been in the wilds of Nebraska there were <br/>
folks to connect with and things to do. <br/>

&gt;&gt;art class if that is something she is missing?&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would you stop with a class? Why would you start with a class? <br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t you start with exploring your local environment for art or using <br/>
the amazing resources that are on the internet? Why wouldn&#39;t you look at Georgia <br/>
O&#39;Keefe&#39;s explorations of the natural world? Annie Dillard&#39;s discussions of the <br/>
beauty that is around you? Ansel Addams photography? The fabulous rice field <br/>
plantings in Japan <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztF8xQpjQgA?">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztF8xQpjQgA?</a> The corn palace <br/>
in Mitchell South Dakota? Crop circles in the UK <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_circle">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_circle</a> or this wonderful site: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.circlemakers.org?">http://www.circlemakers.org?</a> The beauty in a chrysalis or a spider web dotted <br/>
with dew? I could go on and on and on. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, looking out the kitchen window, I saw the most amazing pre-storm <br/>
light. Because I&#39;ve been using my film camera more lately in the run up to <br/>
resetting up a darkroom, I&#39;ve been thinking about light. Because I use black and <br/>
white mostly I was interested in the interplay of colour and light in that <br/>
moment. David, my husband, shoots primarily colour film and if his camera had <br/>
been loaded I would have taken a picture of the red of the roof tiles against <br/>
the dark blue-grey of the storm clouds and the slate of the garage roof and the <br/>
green of the grape vines. It was a boring image in terms of composition, but <br/>
amazing in terms of colour and contrast and light. I didn&#39;t need to be anywhere <br/>
special to see that. The Telegraph has been running a series of photos of <br/>
British autumn pictures: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/gardeningpicturegalleries/8827345/Our-third-gallery-of-Telegraph-readers-pictures-of-autumn-colour-in-Britain.html.">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/gardeningpicturegalleries/8827345/Our-third-gallery-of-Telegraph-readers-pictures-of-autumn-colour-in-Britain.html.</a><br/>
 These are small moments of wonder. Look for the wonder that is in your life. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juliepersons/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/juliepersons/</a> is Julie Persons&#39; flickr stream. <br/>
She&#39;s an unschooling mom who lives a very rural life and finds wonder all around <br/>
her. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Starting with a class is a problem if both of you are still deschooling. <br/>
Starting with a class means that you don&#39;t really grasp the notion that art <br/>
isn&#39;t a subject to be studies outside of the rest of living, it is a part of all <br/>
the rest of life. It means that you are looking at learning as something that is <br/>
accomplished best in a setting where one person tells a bunch of other people <br/>
what to explore and when and how and not as something that happens at it&#39;s best <br/>
when the individual is discovering the world in a fully engaged and interested <br/>
fashion. That doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t seek out other people with more knowledge, <br/>
but it does mean that you seek them out when you know what it is you want to <br/>
know rather then looking to them to tell you what it is you need to learn first <br/>
and second and third. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Starting with a class means that you are telling your daughter that school is <br/>
honestly the best way to gain information about the things that you are <br/>
interested in. Starting with a class supports a schooling relationship with <br/>
knowledge. It completely argues that art is a set of skills that need to be <br/>
obtained in order to accomplish art and that it is best obtained by going to <br/>
someone else to learn them. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Art%3F">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Art%3F</a> is an <br/>
entry on Leo Tolstoy&#39;s essay What Is Art? In his essay he writes &quot;In order <br/>
correctly to define art, it is necessary, first of all, to cease to consider it <br/>
as a means to pleasure and to consider it as one of the conditions of human <br/>

I have tried other options. again this goes back to until you live in a situation and are dealing with the child in question you just don&#39;t have any idea.  We do go out and look at sunsets, starts, moon, flowers, etc.  Will she watch a show on art, no.  Nothing wrong with her going to an art class if that is what she wants to do.  I didn&#39;t sign her up for the class without getting her opinion on it.  She has a hard time making up her mind in doing anything.

I linked a couple of things in my post. Given your response &quot; having to get on <br/>
to your child every morning to get her up, every afternoon to do homework and <br/>
every night to go to bed, that&#39;s not the kind of life anybody would want their <br/>
child to grow up in. there was to much arguing, crying, stubborness, etc.&quot; I&#39;m <br/>
guessing that you didn&#39;t read this one: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a> which <br/>
talks about letting a child experience school on their own terms. There is <br/>
usually more than one way to deal with a situation. It may help you to see more <br/>
options. <br/>
<br/>
If your daughter is flipping back and forth as frequently as you say she is than <br/>
she isn&#39;t really finding a happy life in either place. In that situation I would <br/>
be looking for ways of making one or the other better, or look for a third <br/>
choice. You say that your rural life is a limiting factor, maybe you need to <br/>
address that aspect. We live in a rural location but go into town regularly and <br/>
have found local activities to engage with. The UK&#39;s rural is distinctly <br/>
different from the US, but when I&#39;ve been in the wilds of Nebraska there were <br/>
folks to connect with and things to do. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why would you stop with a class? Why would you start with a class? <br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t you start with exploring your local environment for art or using <br/>
the amazing resources that are on the internet? Why wouldn&#39;t you look at Georgia <br/>

Yesterday, looking out the kitchen window, I saw the most amazing pre-storm <br/>
light. Because I&#39;ve been using my film camera more lately in the run up to <br/>
resetting up a darkroom, I&#39;ve been thinking about light. Because I use black and <br/>
white mostly I was interested in the interplay of colour and light in that <br/>
moment. David, my husband, shoots primarily colour film and if his camera had <br/>
been loaded I would have taken a picture of the red of the roof tiles against <br/>
the dark blue-grey of the storm clouds and the slate of the garage roof and the <br/>
green of the grape vines. It was a boring image in terms of composition, but <br/>
amazing in terms of colour and contrast and light. I didn&#39;t need to be anywhere <br/>
special to see that. The Telegraph has been running a series of photos of <br/>
British autumn pictures: <br/>

She&#39;s an unschooling mom who lives a very rural life and finds wonder all around <br/>
her. <br/>
<br/>
Starting with a class is a problem if both of you are still deschooling. <br/>
Starting with a class means that you don&#39;t really grasp the notion that art <br/>
isn&#39;t a subject to be studies outside of the rest of living, it is a part of all <br/>
the rest of life. It means that you are looking at learning as something that is <br/>
accomplished best in a setting where one person tells a bunch of other people <br/>
what to explore and when and how and not as something that happens at it&#39;s best <br/>
when the individual is discovering the world in a fully engaged and interested <br/>
fashion. That doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t seek out other people with more knowledge, <br/>
but it does mean that you seek them out when you know what it is you want to <br/>
know rather then looking to them to tell you what it is you need to learn first <br/>
and second and third. <br/>
<br/>
Starting with a class means that you are telling your daughter that school is <br/>
honestly the best way to gain information about the things that you are <br/>
interested in. Starting with a class supports a schooling relationship with <br/>
knowledge. It completely argues that art is a set of skills that need to be <br/>
obtained in order to accomplish art and that it is best obtained by going to <br/>
someone else to learn them. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Art%3F">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Art%3F</a> is an <br/>

correctly to define art, it is necessary, first of all, to cease to consider it <br/>

life. Viewing it in this way we cannot fail to observe that art is one of the <br/>

<br/>
People&#39;s phrasing reveals more than they realize, sometimes more than  <br/>
what they&#39;re able to see themselves.<br/>
<br/>
No one here can tell you what&#39;s going on in your house, but people can  <br/>
see things in how you&#39;re choosing to paint the picture that ring alarm  <br/>
bells and then point them out.<br/>
<br/>
When you said she likes art in school the only thing you mentioned --  <br/>
suggesting that in your mind that was the best of your responses to  <br/>
her need -- you said you signed her up for a class.<br/>
<br/>
A class is one of thousands of ways to explore art. It shouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
the first thing to think of when unschooling. (Nor should it be the  <br/>
last. It will depend on the child.) But especially if you&#39;re  <br/>
struggling with a daughter wanting to jump in and out of school, right  <br/>
now look for the *other* opportunities that abound in life to explore  <br/>
art so she isn&#39;t thinking the very very best way to explore art is in  <br/>
a classroom from a teacher. Let her experience what she *can&#39;t* get in  <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Find out what it is your daughter likes about school and provide more  <br/>
of that. If it&#39;s friends, find ways for her to connect with other  <br/>
kids*.  Invite some over. Invite several on an outing to collect  <br/>
leave, take a walk, go through a corn maze, pick out and carve  <br/>
pumpkins. (Loads of things to do in the fall!) Invite them over for an  <br/>
activity. Invite them over just to play :-)<br/>
<br/>
*(A class *could* be a way to connect with other kids but especially  <br/>
with your daughter *right now* I&#39;d think of other ways. My daughter  <br/>
found it hard to connect with other kids in a class. Though she did  <br/>
enjoy being in a room full of people who enjoyed art. In fact she  <br/>
enjoyed adult art and writing get togethers just as much or more as  <br/>
kid classes.)<br/>

<br/>
School is one option. &quot;Other options&quot; are thousands of things plus  <br/>
variations on those thousands of things.<br/>
<br/>
I know you&#39;re getting frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to say no. It&#39;s really hard to see life from new points of  <br/>
view so that the problem looks different. And that&#39;s what unschooling  <br/>
calls for.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t hand you the answer. We can *show* you new points of view. We  <br/>
can *show* you what putting those new points of view into practice can  <br/>
look like in other families. It&#39;s up to you to shift your view. It&#39;s  <br/>
up to you to play with those ideas, let them spark other ideas. See  <br/>
the ideas in new ways.<br/>
<br/>
Right now you&#39;re stuck in your vision of what life needs to be. It  <br/>
might help to back away from the problem, let life play out, let ideas  <br/>
swirl.<br/>
<br/>
*Be* with your daughter. Do fun things together. Find other kids for  <br/>
her to do fun things with. Yes, it&#39;s hard. But neither the hardness  <br/>
nor your inability so far to find ways to meet her needs make her less  <br/>
needful. You can&#39;t change her. You can only change yourself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I didn&#39;t sign her up for the class without getting her opinion on it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why wouldn&#39;t she think of class as the way to explore art? That&#39;s the  <br/>
way art is for kids as far as she knows. It&#39;s up to you to show her  <br/>
the wide open possibilities.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The primary purpose of the list is to help people turn their thinking  <br/>
around. To look at their child rather than out at the world.<br/>
<br/>
The ideas offered are what turned around thinking can be like for  <br/>
other unschoolers. They&#39;re not intended as &quot;plug and play&quot; ideas.  <br/>
(Though it&#39;s convenient when an idea can be that.) They&#39;re  <br/>
springboards to get you thinking in new ways.<br/>

<br/>
One sentencejumped out at me<br/>
<br/>
ÂShe has a hard time making up her mind in doing anything. Â<br/>
<br/>
To me this sounds still so much of a person who is either not fully within their own<br/>
authority to come to their own conclusions and decisions Â i.e. she may feel under<br/>
pressure to perform OR she just has her own way of coming to decisions and conclusions<br/>
which does not necessarily conform to your style and time line.<br/>
<br/>
I for instance am a Âsnap decision makerÂ and I know of at least ten people around me who<br/>
should never make spontaneous decisions but sleep and maybe really sleep (like days to<br/>
weeks) on anything a lot before they know what is right for them at the time.<br/>
<br/>
For these people the opportunity does not go away until they come to their conclusion. <br/>
<br/>
For me it is another matter. But I know enough about this process already to give others a<br/>
lot of free space (time) when it comes to deciding what it is ÂtheyÂ really, really want<br/>
for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I have one granddaughter (4 Â½) who is another snap decider. I can so relate to her. But<br/>
arranging our home front around her decisions, when all the others are still making up<br/>
their minds induces a lot of drama on a daily basis. (She has already ÂshoppedÂ the ice<br/>
cream while the others still wonder if a pizza or a home cooked would be an option.) If<br/>
you are a snap decider and your daughter is not you might put a lot of pressure on her Â<br/>
unintended of course. &lt;grin&gt; I know that I do and I see it with Ariella every day.<br/>
<br/>
Or, the other idea is that she still needs decompression from Âhaving to doÂ. Can you give<br/>
her space to do nothing and more nothing and even more nothing? And donÂt jump through<br/>
hoops when she mentions that it might be nice to do X and provide the full spectrum of<br/>
becoming a master at X immeditely. Finding a way to do things your own way has so much<br/>
potential for joy and achievement. Just because someone likes to draw does not mean that<br/>
they need structured art classes.<br/>

from Namibia Â somewhere in Africa Â where I did take off early from work today Â two<br/>
hours! To do a little personal decompression. It was a snap decision, though.<br/>

PS Â Please forgive me if I misunderstood you. I do tend to read things into words that<br/>
were not intended.<br/>

her to do fun things with.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I am with my daughter and we do fun things.  She has kids to play with all the time.  We do what the kids want when they want 99% of the time.  we can&#39;t always do, go and be everywhere all the time.  My daughter has all the art supplies she wants here at home and we find things to draw.  Im not artistic but i do draw pics with her and we figure out what looks best etc.  I feel like I am doing all the right things so i get confused when she does say she wants to go back to school.  is she just trying me to see how I will react?  I ask her what she misses about school but when we try and do the things here she says she misses she doesnt&#39; want to do them.  that&#39;s where i don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>

School is one option. &quot;Other options&quot; are thousands of things plus <br/>
variations on those thousands of things.<br/>
<br/>
I know you&#39;re getting frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to say no. It&#39;s really hard to see life from new points of <br/>
view so that the problem looks different. And that&#39;s what unschooling <br/>
calls for.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t hand you the answer. We can *show* you new points of view. We <br/>
can *show* you what putting those new points of view into practice can <br/>
look like in other families. It&#39;s up to you to shift your view. It&#39;s <br/>
up to you to play with those ideas, let them spark other ideas. See <br/>
the ideas in new ways.<br/>
<br/>
Right now you&#39;re stuck in your vision of what life needs to be. It <br/>
might help to back away from the problem, let life play out, let ideas <br/>
swirl.<br/>
<br/>
*Be* with your daughter. Do fun things together. Find other kids for <br/>
her to do fun things with. Yes, it&#39;s hard. But neither the hardness <br/>
nor your inability so far to find ways to meet her needs make her less <br/>
needful. You can&#39;t change her. You can only change yourself.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t sign her up for the class without getting her opinion on it.<br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t she think of class as the way to explore art? That&#39;s the <br/>
way art is for kids as far as she knows. It&#39;s up to you to show her <br/>
the wide open possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
What are her favorite things in art class?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; She has a hard time making up her mind in doing anything. I <br/>
&gt; appreciate all the links and ideas but what works for one doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; work for all.<br/>
<br/>
The primary purpose of the list is to help people turn their thinking <br/>
around. To look at their child rather than out at the world.<br/>
<br/>
The ideas offered are what turned around thinking can be like for <br/>
other unschoolers. They&#39;re not intended as &quot;plug and play&quot; ideas. <br/>
(Though it&#39;s convenient when an idea can be that.) They&#39;re <br/>
springboards to get you thinking in new ways.<br/>

that she is struggling to figure out what to do with herself. School frames so <br/>
much of someone&#39;s time, so much of someone&#39;s thinking that it must feel like a <br/>
giant vacuum of space and time when it is gone. When she talks about going back <br/>
to school the most is she tired? Is she hungry? Is she bored? Can you see a <br/>
pattern in her moments of thinking that something else would be better than what <br/>
is? If you can&#39;t in this moment can you begin to look for one? If there is a <br/>
pattern, try and deal with that. Not in an obvious and overhanded way, but in a <br/>
gentle and caring way. Offer her food when she&#39;s hungry; change the mood, the <br/>
activity when she&#39;s bored; cuddle up and watch a movie, do a slower, quieter <br/>
thing when she&#39;s tired. See if those acts move her away from a buzzy unhappiness <br/>
with her right now moments. See if taking care of those more basic needs help <br/>
her to enjoy her life without school more. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022367577">I would also add that she may feel like she&#39;s being asked to own her education <br/>
in a way that she doesn&#39;t feel capable of doing. I have no way of knowing. But <br/>
she may see the burden of becoming a fully functioning adult as resting on her 9 <br/>
year old shoulders in a way that makes her feel as though playing at home isn&#39;t <br/>
preparing for it as well as going to school would do. School has done a fabulous <br/>
job of convincing folks that it is fit to purpose. Among those folks are the <br/>
children attending. She may not be seeing how what she is doing now, whatever <br/>
she wants, whenever she wants (99% of the time--which is phenomenal, there is no <br/>
way that we achieve that level of response to Simon and Linnaea), is going to <br/>
get her to the goal that seemed to be so very important when she was at school. <br/>
So important that you were, even if for a short time, putting her through what <br/>
you described as this: &quot;having to get on to your child every morning to get her <br/>
up, every  afternoon to do homework and every night to go to bed, that&#39;s not the  <br/>
kind of life anybody would want their child to grow up in.  there was to  much <br/>
arguing, crying, stubborness, etc.  I for one don&#39;t want my  child&#39;s childhood <br/>
to be about getting angry and crying everyday.&quot;  It is hard to have that be a <br/>
part of what is so important, I imagine, and to have it be completely taken away <br/>
without a similar system being put in place. Maybe she doesn&#39;t know why it isn&#39;t <br/>
the system that you are using anymore. Maybe she doesn&#39;t believe that it can&#39;t <br/>
be important. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749037376">Hi Denise<br/>
I read your reply and I am feeling a little bit &#39;put in my place&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
As I was contemplating my response, of which I am not sure that I should post it, but I&#39;ll<br/>
do it anyway, I asked what it is that you are really asking for?<br/>
<br/>
I also remember a sentence where you say, paraphrased, jumpig in and out of school every<br/>
couple of weeks. <br/>
<br/>
Is it that this is not really about your daughter who is doing fine even with some<br/>
boulders along the way but about your good intentions about her?<br/>
If that is the case than I am off the bandwaggon this very moment because I do not intend<br/>
to rattle anyone&#39;s good intentions. I got my fingers burnt on that just this afternoon by<br/>
my husband. &lt;grin&gt; Well, I have good intentions and he was so friendly as to give me flak.<br/>
<br/>
If you truly think that you know that it is not good for your daughter to hop in andout of<br/>
school or classs or whatever then you are right. You know your daughter better than we do.<br/>
<br/>
I did not even contemplate sending my youngest son back t school for a day after I<br/>
realized what it did to him for the short while that he was indeed attending. Even when he<br/>
mentioned about five years later that he thought it would be better for him to go back.<br/>
<br/>
I just &#39;knew&#39; that he would suffer as bad as before and that it would take even longer for<br/>
him to become his healthy self again even after a short term at public (or private)<br/>
school. But I did not ask this list for advice, because I knew (better) already!<br/>
<br/>
Learning whatever he learned out ofschool did not come that easy to my son all the time.<br/>
But that is not the issue. His emotional health away from the school environment, even if<br/>
it contained his only friend, is more important that his nightmares, sleep issues,<br/>
accidents, colds, stomach upsets and other things that are related to his schooling<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
Though, I know that there are children who are ok or even thrive.<br/>
<br/>
Others have commented enough,too.<br/>
<br/>
I really did not want to tell you how or what. My post was about decision making<br/>
authority.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is that how often she&#39;s asking to bounce in and out of school? You said she&#39;d gone back before, but you didn&#39;t mention how long ago, how often, how long she stayed last time. Are there other kids at home?<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 9? Depending on her specific personality, etc., and especially if she&#39;s asking to bounce in and out every couple of weeks, maybe sit down with her and help her draw up a pros and cons list or a general goals list (I don&#39;t mean of achievement, but of what she envisions would make her happy) and then maybe she can figure out which setting would appeal to her most and you can switch gears into helping her get the most out of whichever setting that is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t want her or me living the life we did while in public school. having to get on to your child every morning to get her up, every afternoon to do homework and every night to go to bed, that&#39;s not the kind of life anybody would want their child to grow up in. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>there was to much arguing, crying, stubborness, etc. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Definitely read the &quot;school choice&quot; link. It was very helpful to me when my kids decided to go back and &quot;try school&quot; last year after having been home for a year. There were no more battles about any of the things you mentioned (like there had been before we decided to homeschool the first go-round) because it was all my son&#39;s  (now 9) choice to go. He knew it was his choice and he knew he could come home at any point, and that in the meantime, I would help him negotiate the things he had found difficult the first time. I worked with his teacher to tweak some of the assignments -- and especially the homework assignments -- to better match his learning style, and the rest was totally his choice.<br/>
<br/>
With homework, I sat with him to get it done and helped him when he needed it. He groused exactly once about doing it, and I said &quot;You know better than I what the consequence is of not doing your homework, so you can decide which is worse, doing the homework or dealing with Mrs. McCarthy.&quot; He usually chose doing homework because his teacher&#39;s consequence was missing recess, and he liked recess. Same with bedtime and getting up. He knew how much sleep he needed, and he knew he didn&#39;t like to be late to school, so he went to bed without complaint in time to get enough sleep and get up on time. <br/>
<br/>
I missed the kids. I missed the kids having lots of time to play together. But if it had been, ultimately, where they were happiest, I would have done what I could do to help them get the most of it.<br/>
<br/>
My son stayed exactly one grading period and decided to come home. He hadn&#39;t missed a single day, he was never late, and he did his homework without complaint, all because he knew it was his choice. He even articulated exactly that when I asked him once (before I knew he would be returning home) why he thought it was going better than it had when he was in first grade.<br/>

It was a little harder for my daughter (kindergarten) to decide which she preferred. She asked to come home and then two weeks later said she wanted to go back. She went for three more weeks and then only wanted to go on art days. I told her that if she wanted to go most of the time and only stay home sometimes, we could probably swing that, but that if she only wanted to go one day per week we would get in trouble with the school. She decided to come home and we just worked really hard to get her more of what she liked about school -- time with other little girls her age and art -- and she was thrilled to ditch the worksheets, hours on end of sitting at a table, an no time to just sit and think by herself.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like the decision to come back home has been made and now we &quot;don&#39;t have to worry about it any more.&quot; At 9, 6, and 4, my kids&#39; needs, wants, and interests are changing all the time and we need to reassess and adjust our routines and activities to keep everybody content.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; thank you Nance.  My thoughts exactly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You also mentioned she doesn&#39;t say it all that often. In that case, I&#39;d let it go. Maybe ask what she&#39;d like to be doing in school right now, or something of that sort - something positive but non-commital. Don&#39;t jump to the conclusion its something she&#39;s going to want the next day - or even the next moment. <br/>
<br/>
If its something she&#39;s yearning for, that&#39;s another matter!<br/>
<br/>
If she wants to take classes or join clubs, then do that, but as Joyce mentioned, don&#39;t jump right away to the idea of a class as a way to do something. That does seem like an area of &quot;stuckness&quot; a place where you need to do more deschooling - maybe you and your daughter, both. In fact, it could be better to actively avoid anything class-like for awhile and learn to think outside the box more - ask for ideas on the list if you&#39;re struggling to come up with those &quot;out of the box&quot; ideas. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s where you&#39;re getting stuck, actually. Can you step back from it? Maybe shift your thinking from &quot;good decision&quot; to &quot;thoughtful decision&quot; or &quot;mindful&quot; if you prefer. Somewhat ironically, that can include a lot of &quot;going with the flow&quot; - you said your daughter will bring up school when she&#39;s bored, but then shift to something else. That&#39;s an important point! My daughter has never been in school, but she often says &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; when she&#39;s transitioning from one thing to the next. It took me awhile to step away from the word &quot;bored&quot; and learn to see her as being in the midst of a transition and trying to find a way to express that awkward uncomfortable feeling of being neither here nor there. Maybe your daughter uses &quot;I wish I was in school&quot; the same way. Say something positive or non-commital or nothing at all for awhile. There may not be a decision for you to make at all!<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not always easy being the parent. It&#39;s not always easy being the kid, either. This business of being a human being . . . especially if you&#39;re not following someone else&#39;s set of rules. . . not always fun or easy. <br/>
<br/>
But you could relax about it. You could decide that you, if not your daughter, are going to take a break from worrying about the &quot;to school or not to school&quot; question. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe tell her that? &quot;I hear you saying you miss school but that doesn&#39;t sound like exactly the answer to me. I need to think about this for a while. And talk to you when you have things to add about the subject. It&#39;s not a closed door but I need to mull, to stew, to put it in the back of my mind while we enjoy our days and see what happens.&quot;<br/>
