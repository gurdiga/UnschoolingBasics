 Before I came home with my three children I was a recreation therapist for<br/>
&gt; 15 years and what I know is that people do not give much credit to what they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know or to the everyday things or leisure activites they do for<br/>
&gt; learning purposes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not only do they not give much credit, they become defensive of their own<br/>
way of doing things.  I have a dear friend whose children are in public<br/>
school.  Anytime one of her homeschooling friends even mentions something<br/>
homeschool related she becomes defensive and mentions that she is hurt by<br/>
our judging her when we weren&#39;t judging at all.  It could be something as<br/>
simple as mentioning a homeschool activity such as a recent discussion about<br/>
a museum exhibit and mentioning that we had attended with our homeschool<br/>
group.  Sometimes I think she feels like she could be doing more with her<br/>
children so just the mention of what she sees as a lacking on her part feels<br/>
like criticism.  Not that we are criticizing, but that she is critical of<br/>
her own decisions.<br/>
<br/>
My mother always questions why I am &quot;doing this.&quot;  She doesn&#39;t understand<br/>
why I would want to do &quot;all this work&quot; when the school system can do it for<br/>
me.  She has said to me before, &quot;School was good enough for you.&quot;  Ah, but<br/>
how much different would I be had I been homeschooled?  My mother is<br/>
defensive because I am doing something different, making different<br/>
decisions, than she did.  What she did wasn&#39;t &quot;as good.&quot;  I&#39;ve learned not<br/>
to complain about anything to my mother.  Not lack of free time, feeling<br/>
overburdened on weeks when we have a crammed full schedule, not sleeping<br/>
well, Dan working late hours, etc because it is all (in her mind) related to<br/>
the children not being in school.<br/>
