<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101016684">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Our newest book, the Unschooling Unmanual, is now available. It was<br/>
co-edited by me and my son Jason, 27, who unschooled from the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
The Unmanual has personal stories and essays by unschoolers Nanda Van<br/>
Gestel, Rue Kream, Mary Van Doren, Kim Houssenloge and me, as well as<br/>
a wonderful essay by Daniel Quinn, author of Ishmael, and an excerpt<br/>
from John Holt&#39;s book Learning All the Time. It&#39;s intended for both<br/>
seasoned and prospective unschoolers, and should also be helpful for<br/>
skeptical relatives and friends.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly Lovejoy&#39;s article &quot;What is Unschooling?&quot; will be included in the<br/>
translated editions, and in an expanded edition we hope to have some<br/>
time in &#39;09.<br/>
<br/>
To read an excerpt and two book reviews, or to order the book, please<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;re very excited about our new book. Please take a look!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
