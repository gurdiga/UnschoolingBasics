<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770142840">Even after 2 years of working towards radical unschooling, I still<br/>
praise too much.  It&#39;s descriptive praise, but I still feel like it&#39;s<br/>
manipulative (i.e. to get my daughters to treat each other well or<br/>
help out more).  <br/>
<br/>
For example, if one daughter shares or is nice with the other<br/>
daughter, I feel strongly compelled to say &quot;That was thoughtful&quot; or<br/>
&quot;Thanks for sharing, it made X happy&quot; or &quot;That was helpful.&quot;  I&#39;m<br/>
working on decreasing this problem, but I still feel that they need<br/>
this external motivation, especially the 3 yo. (which I know is wrong).  <br/>
<br/>
At the same time, I do feel that letting children know that they are<br/>
helpful, etc. is important to show appreciation and help build their<br/>
self-esteem.  I know with my husband and I, when we are feeling<br/>
unappreciated or underappreciated that we argue more and our cup<br/>
doesn&#39;t feel full (unfortunately, it happens more than I like, but<br/>
that&#39;s another story-lol).  Some of it may also be that we just went<br/>
through several months of my older child being very angry with my<br/>
younger child.  Fortunately, we are in a much happier, better place<br/>
now, but maybe I fear it will return if I don&#39;t continue to point out<br/>
the positive behavior. <br/>
<br/>
Where do I draw the line?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Where do I draw the line?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
To me, it&#39;s about being genuine.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that my children are older.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ll often thank/praise them for their treatment of the other or of <br/>
me or of a stranger. It&#39;s showing appreciation, and it&#39;s meaningful. I <br/>
*truly* do appreciate when they are kind or generous or when they go <br/>
out of their way to be sweet.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do it to be manipulative. Just honest.<br/>
<br/>
If it *feels* as if you&#39;re being manipulative, then it probably *is*. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course, *I* think it&#39;s best to just model that generosity and <br/>
kindness, but telling someone when you&#39;re appreciative is also nice.<br/>

<br/>
Heck, I really like hearing that someone appreciates when I do <br/>
something that is nice/pleases them/makes someone happy (fill in your <br/>
own situation), NO MATTER what MY motivation is (on not)!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a difference between praise and thanks.  :)  I have been known to<br/>
say, &quot;Thanks for helping me with the dishes.  It sure made it quicker so we<br/>
can go do other things.&quot;  OR &quot;Thank you for being so kind to your brother.<br/>
He seems to be having a tough day.&quot;  I think it is fine to thank children<br/>
(and adults!!!) for their efforts and kindness.  I also think it helps them<br/>
see that their help and kindness is appreciated (just like adults do).  It<br/>
isn&#39;t arbitrary meaningless praise.  It&#39;s honest and sincere.  At least I<br/>
hope it is.  :)<br/>

I&#39;m wondering why you think it is manipulative and then perhaps that will  <br/>
help you moderate yourself.  Your motivation is to keep a happy home (I can  <br/>
relate!) and perhaps for awhile the praising was helping but now you feel it is  <br/>
no longer genuine.  Is it your tone of voice?  I hear many parents  using too <br/>
much sweetness and it just sounds fake.  I hear myself using it  from time to <br/>
time and I just cringe. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
You are helping two small children navigate the difficult world of  <br/>
relationships, I think everyone could use some help there!  I think what  you are doing <br/>
is great, my kids still need some help to see how what they do  affects the <br/>
other.  But if they are balking to my talking, I stop.   With my kids, sometime <br/>
a private smile or a nod is enough.  I think I  use the descriptive talk <br/>
mostly when I am alone with the child now (I appreciate  that you helped your <br/>
brother today, even though you didn&#39;t want to).<br/>
 <br/>
If you are concerned with returning to the less-than-peaceful home, I  <br/>
suggest working on building relationships with each child individually and also  as <br/>
a family.  Perhaps if you put your energy *there* instead of focusing on  <br/>
*their* relationship, you might move out of this phase that feels  manipulative.  <br/>
Then you can move in periodically when it does feel  necessary or genuine.<br/>
