They&#39;re misbehaving because they&#39;re fighting to get loose of the  <br/>

Wow... this just cleared up for me why me and my catholic school peers were labeled as &quot;worse&quot; than our public school counterparts!  A tradition we have in PA and NJ is the week after graduation, you rent a house with your friend &quot;down the shore&quot; (aka &quot;at the beach&quot; for the rest of the country).  The landlords always complained that the catholic school week wreaked havoc on the properties and the police had to be much more present!!<br/>
 <br/>
I get it!!   What an ah-ha moment!  ...for unschooling parenting that is!<br/>

that it is important to do what is right because it is right, not <br/>
because either fear of getting caught, or promise of reward.  That <br/>
has always been my goal with my son, which is why I explain the <br/>
reasoning behind my rules.  If he has a good reason to feel they are <br/>
unfair or inappropriate in any given circumstance, he can (and has) <br/>
persuaded me to rethink and such.  We have rules, but not <br/>
the &quot;because I said so&quot; type.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to get kids *who <br/>
weren&#39;t raised that way from the start* to this point. Kids who are <br/>
externally motivated by fear or rewards because that&#39;s how it&#39;s been <br/>
for their whole life? It&#39;s been almost three years since my kids <br/>
moved in with us and sometimes I feel like I&#39;m not making much <br/>
progress with my older two in this area. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions...no matter how small. Sometimes I just <br/>
need a fresh set of ideas to get me back on track. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll give it a shot, anyway.  Do you explain WHY for each rule, <br/>
discipline, etc?  (Yeah, I know, a lot of people here would say that <br/>
discipline is a dirty word, but I don&#39;t mean it as corporal <br/>
punishment.)  There are logical consequences, of course -- but they <br/>
may not be stated, and thus not understood.  For instance, if your <br/>
child says something mean and disrespectful, you might say, &quot;Gee, <br/>
that really hurt my (or Bobby&#39;s, or whoever) feelings.&quot;  The child <br/>
might not realize that there is a consequence to that behavior, that <br/>
next time they want to do something that requires that person, that <br/>
person may be less inclined to want to help.<br/>
<br/>
I realize this sounds rambly and incoherent.  Also, specific praise <br/>
for positive actions tends to be very helpful in increasing that <br/>
behavior.  &quot;Good job&quot; is kinda weak.... But &quot;I really appreciate how <br/>
hard it was to tell the truth.  You probaby felt terrible when you <br/>
broke that priceless Ming vase, and were scared to tell me.&quot;  Also, <br/>
when appropriate, share stories of when you did things.  It&#39;s easier <br/>
to own up to being less than perfect to someone who is -- but kids <br/>
don&#39;t always realize that we really WERE kids once, and messed up, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what sort of details would fit your situation, but this <br/>
is just what I could come up with off the top of my head.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you have some specific examples?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier to talk about the philosophy in terms of how it applies  <br/>
to a problem.<br/>
