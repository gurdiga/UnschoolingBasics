<br/>
I&#39;ve only seen fondue setups, but I don&#39;t own one. <br/>
The kids really got into this whole thing with ideas. <br/>
From a blue jello see with fish, to gummy bears,<br/>
mini-pretzel huts, orange dum-dums for torches,<br/>
palm-trees with licorice rope hammocks, a fudge<br/>
&quot;cone&quot;, crushed peanuts an M&M&#39;s for rocks, a peanut<br/>
butter fudge island and some type of rubber<br/>
contraption to go up through the center and with some<br/>
type of way to push air through to make the choco<br/>
syrup ooze up, out and down the sides.  However, maybe<br/>
the fondue would work better.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if only we can get it to work!  We drew a model<br/>
and we&#39;re going to do a construction paper model<br/>
before attempting the real thing.  If only I could<br/>
gather everyone to come over and help us eat it!! <br/>
I&#39;ve gained five pounds thinking about it.<br/>

something straw-like and use that to blow bubbles into the chocolate <br/>

yeah, you did it...&lt;wink&gt; didn&#39;t we all?) and that would get the goo <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238592376">I had a friend recently telling me about someone becoming involved in wedding planning and one thing this lady was getting was a chocolate fountain. Maybe worth checking into as well.<br/>
 <br/>
Another suggestion that would go along with the straw idea to get more power would be to try and rig it up to some sort of hand operated pump, a basketball or bicycle pump. I don&#39;t know what the rigging would look like.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds like they want a chocolate fountain, only<br/>
cooler! Chocolate fountains are very &quot;in&quot; now and<br/>
renting one is pricey. You might try using a little<br/>
pump like the ones used for table size fountains. Just<br/>
soak it in some bleachy water (rinse and dry <br/>
well)before trying the chocolate. Make sure the<br/>
chocolate is very well melted before putting the pump<br/>
in. Chocolate does not have to be very hot to flow but<br/>
check for lumps. Chocolate and water don&#39;t mix. While<br/>
the recommendation to melt is in a double boiler, my<br/>
stove on low is actually low enough to melt straight<br/>
on the burner. They could mold the volcano shape with<br/>
chocolate, sticking the gummies etc into that and then<br/>
when they flow the warm chocolate over it the upper<br/>
layers of chocolate would melt settting the things<br/>
free and falling down the sides of the mountain...Hmm,<br/>
In the last 25+ years I&#39;ve done a lot of stuff with<br/>
chocolate and icing but this could be fun. I&#39;m not<br/>
sure I am making sense as it is late and I am mostly<br/>
thinking out loud. Let me know if I can help you out<br/>
with your &quot;fun with chocolate&quot; project. ELISA<br/>

nozzle of an upside-down, *full* bottle of chocolate syrup and somehow <br/>
leave room for you to get your hands underneath there and  SQUEEZE!<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like great fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111543252">Not sure if this will help but Toys R Us sells a chocolate fountain for<br/>
dipping strawberries and cake into.  It&#39;s under $20 and maybe just looking<br/>
at it would help your engineering process, or maybe you could figure out a<br/>
way to &quot;dress it up&quot; like a volcano with big sheets of ganash style<br/>
chocolate or something.  Let me know how it goes. It sounds like a great<br/>
project.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought, I know one can rent large chocolate fountains ( I saw one<br/>
at a wedding recently).  It seems possible to mount such a thing at the top<br/>
of a volcano structure made of foam and foil so  that the chocolate bubbles<br/>
up out over the volcano.  Whew, I&#39;m getting hungry... <br/>
