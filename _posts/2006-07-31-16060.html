<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709096215">&quot;And yes if I had been the one to leave it open he<br/>
would definitely have yelled and cursed at me!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s acting emotionally abusive. I would not tolerate that.<br/>
I also agree that you have to model a different way of relating to<br/>
your children, in order to affect change in your home. Harmoney<br/>
between the parents might be a good place to start. There can&#39;t be<br/>
harmony if someone is allowed to yell and curse at you. Not acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
If a person did that to me, I would walk away and say &quot;when you&#39;re<br/>
ready to talk calmly and respectfully to me, I&#39;d be happy to have a<br/>
conversation, I will not let you talk like this to me&quot;. And mean it.<br/>
<br/>
Are you playing into his rants, by yelling back? Are you enabling him<br/>
by allowing it to continue? He needs to understand that what he&#39;s<br/>
modeling for his children is not healthy behavior.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879052932">More from OP:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t understand how an amusement park and freezer are related.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>actually they are not. my OP did not make that clear and after I sent it I<br/>
realized that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      Will a punishment help them remember to close the freezer?  No.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree,  what&#39;s done is done. I had/have no intention of punishing them<br/>
for that.  It was my dh who was hopping mad and seemed to think they<br/>
did it<br/>
on purpose.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I doubt that your children deliberately went and left<br/>
&gt;the freezer door open to cause all that food to go to waste.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>oh no!  I totally agree it was not deliberate and was an accident!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I had a<br/>
&gt; &gt; conversation with them both about what it means when we say Stop and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t.  They just don&#39;t care, they want to do what they want to do!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is that so wrong?  Is it so wrong to want to do things that you want<br/>
&gt;to do?  What is it that they do that you feel needs to be stopped and<br/>
&gt;that they can&#39;t do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>actually i do feel that they should listen and do as i say.  its not<br/>
like i<br/>
demand so much. in fact i may be what some describe as a permissive<br/>
parent.<br/>
so i should never tell them to do or not do anything? they have so much<br/>
freedom, way too much according to folks like my mother. I don&#39;t want them<br/>
jumping on/off the leather couches. I don&#39;t want them throwing whatever<br/>
they lay hands on. I don&#39;t want them eating in carpeted areas. I don&#39;t<br/>
want<br/>
them making so much noise that it hurts my head.  I don&#39;t want them<br/>
damaging walls and furniture and breaking things and wrecking the<br/>
house.  Is that too much to ask?<br/>
<br/>
my kids do a lot of things that don&#39;t bother me, but DO bother my dh.  not<br/>
to excuse him just to add to the picture here, he is disabled with a<br/>
chronic illness and home 24/7.  Has been home about 2 years now, and<br/>
before<br/>
that was working out of town for 3 years.  So the boys have gone from one<br/>
extreme to another regarding his presence and his negative<br/>
contributions to<br/>
the household. but I actually think I am a better parent when he is<br/>
around,<br/>
maybe it just seems that way because he is worse? I take zoloft though<br/>
which helps me considerably, I&#39;d be monster mommy without it.  btdt.<br/>
(honestly my oldest would try the patience of a saint).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I&#39;m wondering if more mindful parenting could<br/>
&gt;have prevented this accident.  Instead of saying, &quot;You many NEVER go<br/>
&gt;into the freezer again&quot; you could just as easily say, &quot;When you need<br/>
&gt;something from the freezer, let me know and I will help you since that<br/>
&gt;door has problems shutting all the way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s a wonderful way of putting it. except knowing my boys, they would<br/>
agree to that and then forget and open it on their own anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Or be aware of when they<br/>
&gt;have been in the freezer.  Check it from time to time to make sure it<br/>
&gt;is closed yourself.  Before you leave the house or go to bed.  Make it<br/>
&gt;part of your routine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>good idea. thanks :) I don&#39;t know why it doesn&#39;t shut all the way, it<br/>
looks<br/>
like its shut but its not, unless firmly closed.  I&#39;ll have dh check<br/>
if its<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you really think that they say to themselves, &quot;Hey, I know mom told<br/>
&gt;us not to do this, but let&#39;s see how much damage we can cause?&quot;<br/>
&gt;Children don&#39;t think like that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that regarding the freezer, but sometimes I do think that<br/>
about other things.  Sometimes it really seems that way!  with my oldest<br/>
especially, I can stand right in front of him, look him in the eye, and<br/>
tell him not to do something, and he will do it right in front of me. He<br/>
has been this way for years. An example: I&#39;ll tell him not to touch his<br/>
sister (she tends to screech lol) so he&#39;ll touch her one more time and<br/>
then<br/>
dart away.  Or I&#39;ll tell him not to stand on the couch so he&#39;ll do it one<br/>
more time. This is extremely regular behavior for him. Just yesterday he<br/>
had a giant ball and bounced it so high in the garage I was afraid he&#39;d<br/>
take out a light bulb.  He did it again, and this time the ball hit the<br/>
metal pieces that hold up the garage door, and popped. Trashed. And I was<br/>
standing right there. another example, if I am laying on the bed nursing a<br/>
sleeping baby he&#39;ll come in and I&#39;ll ask him to be quiet, he&#39;ll stand out<br/>
of reach and hoot and/or throw something at me before he darts out of the<br/>
room.  I realize I should treat all this with humor but it is very hard to<br/>
do! I get so annoyed!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306886377">More from OP:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do they want to sell some of their toys on ebay to make up for it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yes in part.  definitely could use the money.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Otherwise you are just further distancing trust in your family.  How<br/>
&gt;will they learn to trust you if you say that you forgive them and then<br/>
&gt;continue to punish them for something that most likely was an<br/>
&gt;accident?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>good point. I have in the past made selling the toys a punishment for<br/>
destroying property (like the water bottles I mentioned in a previous<br/>
post).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Where were you when this was going on?  Were you with them?  Engaging<br/>
&gt;them in an activity?  Finding something for them to do so that they<br/>
&gt;could safely and less destructively use their energy?  A romp in the<br/>
&gt;park, bouncing on a mattress on the floor, tumbling on said mattress,<br/>
&gt;a gymnastics class or dance class or just a run around the block on<br/>
&gt;their bikes or scooters (with mom joining them).  When my kids seem to<br/>
&gt;be &quot;cluttery&quot; and restless I know that is a big signal to get out of<br/>
&gt;the house and go somewhere.  Sometimes the park.  Sometimes the<br/>
&gt;bookstore.  Sometimes the backyard.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this was at night, 8 or 9 p.m. although it seems like it went on for hours<br/>
and hours so it must have started earlier.  but this kind of wildness<br/>
often<br/>
occurs at that hour. so going to the park wouldn&#39;t work. but the mattress<br/>
on the floor is a great idea! as for going to a class, they are in<br/>
swimming<br/>
lessons (this is the last week) which are first thing in the morning but<br/>
whatever energy they burn off in that class gets restocked quickly lol.<br/>
they are like the energizer bunny!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read on this list that it is ok to tell children to stop if they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are engaging in behaviors that bother other people (not in those<br/>
&gt; &gt; words).  I was trying so hard to do that.  They will not listen to me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; obey me, whatever word you want to use.  I ask them over and over to<br/>
&gt; &gt; stop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You need to build trust and respect with them before you can expect<br/>
&gt;the same back.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yes, I understand that, and have dried to explain it to dh. (his response,<br/>
they don&#39;t respect anything! obviously he is a very negative person.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Yelling at them constantly to do things that annoy you<br/>
&gt;is not the way to build trust.  What are your priorities when it comes<br/>
&gt;to your children?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my children are my priority. they are the most important part of my life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  To your family?  How will the words you say bring<br/>
&gt;you to a point where your children trust you and respect is mutual and<br/>
&gt;you are joyfully living your lives?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am trying to figure that out! I don&#39;t want my kids growing up like I did<br/>
with an authoritarian father whose very presence in the house was like a<br/>
dark cloud that lifted whenever he drove away. I don&#39;t want every<br/>
birthday,<br/>
holiday and vacation ruined like my father ruined ours.  I want my kids to<br/>
know joy and happiness, to love life.  I want that so much! I am<br/>
trying but<br/>
its hard and so often I just don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)</div>

&gt;him!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know what you mean.  I have become wiser with the years and now when he<br/>
screams and curses at me I tell him not to talk to me that way. I try not<br/>
to talk to the children that way, but do lose control of myself too<br/>
frequently.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Children don&#39;t have the power to get away from their parents,<br/>
&gt;they don&#39;t truly have that freedom usually. So parents should try<br/>
&gt;really, really hard to give children the same respect they&#39;d give<br/>
&gt;another adult...while understanding that they ARE children and are<br/>
&gt;going to make mistakes like that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m trying. Its going to take time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Money comes and goes, food pretty much goes!:) Your children are<br/>
&gt;hopefully here to stay and they need parents that create a loving,<br/>
&gt;nurturing and supportive environment for them. Threats, yelling,<br/>
&gt;cursing and anger do not support them as they grow, it only causes<br/>
&gt;them to lose trust in their parents, themselves and their world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know :(  I think I am much better at not threatening, but I still do<br/>
lose<br/>
my temper and yell. I try to protect them from their father&#39;s verbal<br/>
abuse,<br/>
but sometimes I am so frustrated with them myself that I don&#39;t, because I<br/>
just can&#39;t get them to listen to me when they are acting so wild and<br/>
out of<br/>
control! (but if he makes a ridiculous threat I am quick to assure<br/>
them its<br/>
not going to happen)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Not the best environment for joyful unschooling to take place.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ok. (I am not totally sold on unschooling the school stuff. I think I need<br/>
to conquer these parenting issues before I work on that.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I suggest viewing them as perfect, beautiful human beings that are<br/>
&gt;learning and growing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love the way you put that, and I am trying to do that!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Obedience is not an ideal trait for an<br/>
&gt;unschooler in my opinion. Choosing to obey a directive because it<br/>
&gt;makes sense is one thing, blind obedience is what you&#39;re asking for<br/>
&gt;though and that isn&#39;t honoring the child or their own intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love the way you say that.  my oldest does know (as I have discussed it<br/>
with him) that he can ask why or discuss the issue.  that tends to make my<br/>
dh irate when he does that.  but I have encouraged him. I tell him instead<br/>
of whining or crying about it, talk to me.  ask me why. suggest an<br/>
alternative.  I have also told the boys, if there is something you want to<br/>
do, come to me and ask me and I&#39;ll help you find a way to do it in an<br/>
acceptable way. (example, a month or more ago they were outside<br/>
playing.....as I found out too late, they went in the garage, got unopened<br/>
bottles of soda and water, took them out into the side yard and smashed<br/>
them open with baseball bats, that was some $20 worth of beverages ruined.<br/>
you can imagine our reactions.) I used that as an example to them, if you<br/>
want to do something tell me and I will help you find a way to do it that<br/>
doesn&#39;t cause grief.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Work WITH them, not against them. They are very little boys and what<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re doing to them today, is building a relationship with two<br/>
&gt;teenagers and men. Treat them as the men they are going to become (as<br/>
&gt;far as respect) while letting them be the small people they ARE.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>thank you.  I will try doing exactly that. In fact I will print that out<br/>
and put it where I can see it.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for helping me!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-598760874">I really think that if joyful unschooling is going to unfold in your<br/>
home, the issues surrounding your dh are going to need some attention.<br/>
It sounds like you already know this, but how much is he willing to<br/>
accept responsibility for? I&#39;m importing a couple of links about<br/>
verbal/emotional abuse for your perusal. Some of it may apply and some<br/>
might not, take what helps and leave the rest:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.womanabuseprevention.com/html/emotional_abuse.html">http://www.womanabuseprevention.com/html/emotional_abuse.html</a><br/>
<br/>
This is part that stood out to me:<br/>
~~Aggressing<br/>
<br/>
    * Aggressive forms of abuse include name-calling, accusing,<br/>
blaming, threatening, and ordering. Aggressing behaviors are generally<br/>
direct and obvious. The one-up position the abuser assumes by<br/>
attempting to judge or invalidate the recipient undermines the<br/>
equality and autonomy that are essential to healthy adult<br/>
relationships. This parent-child pattern of communication (which is<br/>
common to all forms of verbal abuse) is most obvious when the abuser<br/>
takes an aggressive stance.<br/>
<br/>
    * Aggressive abuse can also take a more indirect form and may even<br/>
be disguised and &quot;helping.&quot; Criticizing, advising, offering solutions,<br/>
analyzing, proving, and questioning another person may be a sincere<br/>
attempt to help. In some instances however, these behaviors may be an<br/>
attempt to belittle, control, or demean rather than help. The<br/>
underlying judgmental &quot;I know best&quot; tone the abuser takes in these<br/>
situations is inappropriate and creates unequal footing in peer<br/>
relationships. This and other types of emotional abuse can lead to<br/>
what is known as learned helplessness.~~~~<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s from this website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eqi.org/eabuse1.htm">http://eqi.org/eabuse1.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure a lot of it does not apply, but I think it&#39;s worth looking<br/>
at. If he cares about his relationships, then I&#39;d hope he&#39;s willing to<br/>
look at the very real ways he&#39;s hurting both you and your children.<br/>
<br/>
I would not play into his drama. I would stand up for my children and<br/>
let him know that unless he speaks calmly and non-critically you will<br/>
NOT stand by and let it happen. Take the kids and LEAVE the area.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-776882493">I&#39;d like to respond to these comments with memories of my own childhood. My grandmother was a very strict authoritarian, and I honestly don&#39;t think she liked little kids. There were a lot of rules at her house. Children were not allowed in the kitchen (which was where Grandma, my mom and aunts spent a lot of their time, btw) and we weren&#39;t allowed to touch any of the &quot;interesting&quot; things, such as a candelabra on a coffee table right at small child height. I was known as the contrary child; the one who refused to potty train, the one who pushed all the rules, the one who wouldn&#39;t share her mommy. I&#39;ve heard the stories all my life, and even remember some of them. When my grandmother told me not to lay another finger on the candles, I looked her straight in the eye, stretched out one finger, and touched. I even said, &quot;Touch.&quot; I would stand at the door to the kitchen, and slowly inch farther in, just to see how far I could get. I refused to potty train, simply because it was<br/>
 so important to everyone else, and didn&#39;t make sense to me. I didn&#39;t have a good reason to want to. i received lots more attention when I did things my way. The rules didn&#39;t make sense to me, therefore, I pushed them as far as I could. Even as a teenager and young adult, I still did that. I&#39;m trying very hard to parent my children differently.  One of the arbitrary rules as I was growing up was no ears pierced until you were 13. I took that stand for a long time myself, because it&#39;s what I was familiar with. Thanks to my lurking on this list for close to a year, after my almost 4 yo asked for the umpteenth time in several months to have her ears pierced, instead of just saying not yet, we talked about what it would involve and how we&#39;d have to care for pierced ears. She still wants them pierced, so we&#39;re going to do it later this week.  I&#39;ve learned that arbitrary rules are useless, and children understand that frequently much better than adults do. We forget so much as we<br/>
 grow up! I&#39;m trying to learn to be little again, and have the innate intelligence and common sense of a child.<br/>

  You might want to make arrangements to have BOTH of her ears pierced <br/>
at once---one piercer on each side with a &quot;one, two, three,....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe you daughter&#39;s one of those tougher souls, but *I* wasn&#39;t! I was <br/>
ready to walk out with only the one ear pierced when I got mine done at <br/>
12.<br/>
<br/>
  I have a BUNCH of single earrings (you *never* lose BOTH! &lt;g&gt;), and I <br/>
have toyed with the idea of having another hole in one ear. I can&#39;t get <br/>
over the memory of that &quot;crunch-thud&quot; sound! (would that be crund? <br/>
thunch?) Yuck!<br/>
<br/>
 Don&#39;tcha just love onomatopoeia? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  But if Ren and Jon can get a new tattoo at every conference,...maybe I <br/>
could get another hole in Albuquerque.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**After my first ear-piercing experience at 10 years old (both ears), I <br/>
vowed never to do it again. As a teenager and then in college I occasionally <br/>
dabbled in a new *single* hole now and then. I would always split the cost <br/>
with a boy or boyfriend who was getting a single piercing. Now I have 4 <br/>
holes on one ear and 2 on the other. Funny, though, now I NEVER wear <br/>
earrings! In the future, my kids are going to wonder what all these empty <br/>
holes are for...<br/>
<br/>
Tattoos, though, are another thing - despite the annoying discomfort during <br/>
the process, I have slowly become addicted and this discussion has made me <br/>
start thinking about my next one... :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have your ears pierced at a tatto shop rather than at a mall boutique.  For<br/>
one it is much more private. There aren&#39;t two hundred people gawking at you<br/>
as you get your ears pierced.  Plus everytime I have had my ears pierced at<br/>
a tattoo shop I was lying down.  Much more comfortable.  *And* (and IMNSHO<br/>
the most important thing) it is sterile!  They don&#39;t use a gun so non of the<br/>
&quot;crunch-thud&quot; sound.  They use a needle to pierce it with.  No noise at<br/>
all.  I think the only reason that my last one even hurt a little was that<br/>
she hit the cartlidge.  I didn&#39;t have a cartlidge piercing, it is just<br/>
beside the cartlidge, but I think she hit it.  There is definitely a dent in<br/>
the cartlidge on that ear.  LOL!  Besides, it&#39;s sort of walking on the wild<br/>
side to go into a shop in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t know about the cleanliness of those ear piercing guns at the<br/>
malls.  I&#39;ve seen several people get a piercing in a row with only a wipe of<br/>
an alcohol pad between each person.  Ewww.<br/>

My dd Sierra has two holes in each ear now...something I was never<br/>
allowed to have (fundi church we were raised in didn&#39;t allow for<br/>
jewelry). She takes great care of them and her funky style fits her so<br/>
well. I&#39;m really glad my children are getting the freedom to enjoy the<br/>

Deb, <br/>
<br/>
I have several tattoos. If you go to a good tattooist, they&#39;ll help <br/>
you choose a spot that will give the least amount of pain. Yes, it <br/>
hurts...but, it&#39;s not that bad. Scrap your fingernail over and over <br/>
again, in the same spot...it kinda feels like that. More annoying, <br/>
than actual pain. <br/>
<br/>
Use ice for swelling, don&#39;t scratch it and apply neosporin for about <br/>
2 weeks. <br/>
<br/>
Start with something small and be sure before you do it. <br/>
<br/>
I started with one and now have sex...they&#39;re very addicting. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-923830628">Yeah, I was planning to have both ears pierced at the same time! I used to work in a shop where I did ear piercing, and you learned to always do that with little kids. Even as an adult (I got my ears repierced last fall after letting them be closed for a few years), it was hard to do the second ear. However, I have no problems with tattoos! I have quite a collection with lots more planned. My dd likes to mimic that, too, so she&#39;s always drawing or painting &quot;tattoos&quot; on herself. Dh and other family members freak out occasionally, but I just remind them that she just wants to be like her parents, and it&#39;s not as if her artwork is permanent!<br/>
Crystal<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 You might want to make arrangements to have BOTH of her ears pierced <br/>
 at once---one piercer on each side with a &quot;one, two, three,....&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 Maybe you daughter&#39;s one of those tougher souls, but *I* wasn&#39;t! I was <br/>
 ready to walk out with only the one ear pierced when I got mine done at <br/>
 12.<br/>
 <br/>
 I have a BUNCH of single earrings (you *never* lose BOTH! &lt;g&gt;), and I <br/>
 have toyed with the idea of having another hole in one ear. I can&#39;t get <br/>
 over the memory of that &quot;crunch-thud&quot; sound! (would that be crund? <br/>
 thunch?) Yuck!<br/>
 <br/>
 Don&#39;tcha just love onomatopoeia? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456048065">It hurts! But the pain is temporary and the tattoo is forever so it&#39;s worth<br/>
it if it&#39;s important to you. I didn&#39;t have swelling afterwards but itching<br/>
when it was healing. You shouldn&#39;t scratch but smacking it helps a lot. DO<br/>
NOT use NEOSPORIN on it!!!!! I did cuz I ran out if the stuff they gave me<br/>
and I had to get it redone! Neosporin heals it from the inside out and<br/>
pushes out the ink. Use Bacitracin (sp?) only. After care is pretty simple<br/>
and a good tattoo shop will inform you of all aftercare in writing and give<br/>
you the stuff you will need.<br/>
<br/>
-Dawn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay tattoo-ed folks, I need your real life input - just exactly <br/>
what kind of pain is involved either during or afterward? I&#39;m a <br/>
coward about needles in general (I can just about manage to get <br/>
blood drawn each year to check some medical stuff but that takes <br/>
lots of relaxing breathing just to get the needle in and there&#39;s no <br/>
permanent marks or anything left). So, swelling afterward? <br/>
irritation? pain (mild to severe)? etc. What kind of afterward-care <br/>
is needed? (like with piercings that need certain types of cleansing <br/>
and such when they&#39;re fresh)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861886221">The gun doesn&#39;t actually touch the ear, so it&#39;s more sterile than it appears. The only part that touches the ear is the earring, which is factory sealed and sterile. That being said, I also prefer body piercers doing the piercing, because it&#39;s healthier for your ears. With a gun, it punches through your ear, pushes the flesh to the sides, and causes scar tissue. A body piercer uses a hollow needle to &quot;core out&quot; the hole in your ear. It&#39;s much less prone to infection that way, no matter how much you clean or don&#39;t clean your piercing. ( I also used to work at a store that was getting ready to open a body piercing shop, when the location flooded. I have quite the varied work experience!) The only reason I&#39;m not taking my dd to a body piercer is because of the price. Body piercers are more expensive, but they&#39;re worth it. However, dd wants her ears pierced before she&#39;s a flower girl in my brother&#39;s wedding on Saturday, and I just don&#39;t have the money to take her to a body<br/>
 piercer right now.<br/>

 &gt; I have a BUNCH of single earrings (you *never* lose BOTH! &lt;g&gt;), and I<br/>
 &gt; have toyed with the idea of having another hole in one ear. I can&#39;t get<br/>
 &gt; over the memory of that &quot;crunch-thud&quot; sound! (would that be crund?<br/>
 &gt; thunch?) Yuck!<br/>
 <br/>
 Have your ears pierced at a tatto shop rather than at a mall boutique.  For<br/>
 one it is much more private. There aren&#39;t two hundred people gawking at you<br/>
 as you get your ears pierced.  Plus everytime I have had my ears pierced at<br/>
 a tattoo shop I was lying down.  Much more comfortable.  *And* (and IMNSHO<br/>
 the most important thing) it is sterile!  They don&#39;t use a gun so non of the<br/>
 &quot;crunch-thud&quot; sound.  They use a needle to pierce it with.  No noise at<br/>
 all.  I think the only reason that my last one even hurt a little was that<br/>
 she hit the cartlidge.  I didn&#39;t have a cartlidge piercing, it is just<br/>
 beside the cartlidge, but I think she hit it.  There is definitely a dent in<br/>
 the cartlidge on that ear.  LOL!  Besides, it&#39;s sort of walking on the wild<br/>
 side to go into a shop in the first place.<br/>
 <br/>
 I just don&#39;t know about the cleanliness of those ear piercing guns at the<br/>
 malls.  I&#39;ve seen several people get a piercing in a row with only a wipe of<br/>
 an alcohol pad between each person.  Ewww.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694452556">If you want earrings that you won&#39;t react to, try a body piercing shop and look for titanium (my first choice, and what I used last time because of all the infections I&#39;ve had) or surgical steel. There&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re allergic to the nickel, and that&#39;s in dang near all the earrings unless you get really expensive ones. Plus, at a body piercer&#39;s, the jewelry isn&#39;t your every-day, run-of-the-mill earrings, and it makes it so much more interesting! I wish I had the money to go to the conference and meet everyone! I&#39;d definitely be joining you for tattoo night! Unfortunately, it&#39;s not just money, but also my husband wouldn&#39;t be able to come because he&#39;s in *blush and whisper* school! But he wants to be there, so it&#39;s all good.

                           What!? Tattoo night? No way don&#39;t joke me!!!<br/>
 <br/>
 You know, Oklahoma is way behind on this, tattoos are still  <br/>
 technically illegal, and I was already thinking about doing something  <br/>
 there. If there are definitely other people doing this, and you know  <br/>
 the place, i would love to go along! I have a piercing for every  <br/>
 child but Avari, but again, I don&#39;t wear earrings 1) because toddlers  <br/>
 tear them off and 2) it&#39;s hard to find ones I don&#39;t react too.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>actually, i haven&#39;t discussed unschooling with him at all.  home<br/>
schooling,<br/>
yes. I want my boys home, I don&#39;t want them in school. if he were not home<br/>
all the time this entire situation would be different.  he wants the<br/>
oldest<br/>
one to go to school just so he doesn&#39;t have to be around him all the time.<br/>
the other kids are more peaceful when the oldest is not around. as to<br/>
unschooling i think it would work better than what i was trying to<br/>
with him<br/>
last year, which wasn&#39;t working well at all. I am trying to move in that<br/>
direction, but obviously the other issues are more important to work on.<br/>
but I&#39;ve got a lot of pressure from my mom, 3rd graders need to do this,<br/>
learn that, etc. she and I have discussed unschooling and she thinks its<br/>
awful (well, she is a public school teacher so whaddya expect). but<br/>
whether<br/>
to unschool or eclectic home school or whatever label it gets, that is my<br/>
decision not his, as he doesn&#39;t get involved in any of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481005110">I think it really depends on your pain threshold and how you view pain. I had two that were painful; one because it went over my spine and kidney, and one because it went over an area that was seiously out of whack and I jumped anytime I was even touched there. Now it&#39;s better with chiropractic! The rest of mine have been pretty hypnotic experiences. Btw, I am petrified of needles. I hate them, even thinking about them gets me tensed and anxious. However, I have no problems with tattoos. If you have needle issues, though, get a tattoo artist who&#39;s has loads and loads of experience. They&#39;re likely to be quicker, smoother, and not as heavy of hand. The heavier the hand is, the more painful it&#39;s likely to be. Plus, that puts the ink too deep, and it fades a lot more quickly.  I use pure lanolin to heal mine. Some people do have problems with fainting when they get inked. My dh passed out twice during his first sitting, but he&#39;s been fine ever since. Our tattoo artist did say<br/>
 that it&#39;s usually the big, buff, muscled, macho guys who tend to pass out or complain about pain the most. My dh finds tats more painful than I do, also, but he has a lower pain threshold in general than I do. To me, they&#39;re very addicting, and as soon as I find the right image, I&#39;m getting my next one. I&#39;m looking for a fairy that reminds me of my son, something like a leprechaun or somesuch. If anyone knows of any pics that they think might work, let me know!<br/>

 It hurts! But the pain is temporary and the tattoo is forever so it&#39;s worth<br/>
 it if it&#39;s important to you. I didn&#39;t have swelling afterwards but itching<br/>
 when it was healing. You shouldn&#39;t scratch but smacking it helps a lot. DO<br/>
 NOT use NEOSPORIN on it!!!!! I did cuz I ran out if the stuff they gave me<br/>
 and I had to get it redone! Neosporin heals it from the inside out and<br/>
 pushes out the ink. Use Bacitracin (sp?) only. After care is pretty simple<br/>
 and a good tattoo shop will inform you of all aftercare in writing and give<br/>
 you the stuff you will need.<br/>
 <br/>
 -Dawn<br/>
 <br/>
 Okay tattoo-ed folks, I need your real life input - just exactly <br/>
 what kind of pain is involved either during or afterward? I&#39;m a <br/>
 coward about needles in general (I can just about manage to get <br/>
 blood drawn each year to check some medical stuff but that takes <br/>
 lots of relaxing breathing just to get the needle in and there&#39;s no <br/>
 permanent marks or anything left). So, swelling afterward? <br/>
 irritation? pain (mild to severe)? etc. What kind of afterward-care <br/>
 is needed? (like with piercings that need certain types of cleansing <br/>
 and such when they&#39;re fresh)<br/>
 <br/>
