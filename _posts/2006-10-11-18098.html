<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239089674">Okay it&#39;s official, I signed the contracts this morning.  There WILL be a NW Unschooling Conference this Spring!<br/>
<br/>
What: L.I.F.E. is Good NW Unschooling Conference <br/>
When: April 20-22, 2007<br/>
Where: Salbasgeon Suites Hotel, Corvallis, OR<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll post the details and get the website up and running ASAP. Don&#39;t call the hotel yet, I&#39;ll let you know when they&#39;re ready to take reservations. For now, just hold the weekend of April 20 open for unschooling magic! And start hinting to the grandparents about what a great holiday gift an Unschooling Conference would be for the family. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Please pass this along to any lists or individuals that you feel might be interested.<br/>
