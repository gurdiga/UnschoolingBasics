<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116433424">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
some of you might remember me – Johanna from Germany :-)<br/>
<br/>
We are looking for an Au-Pair, though it should be someone who is as  <br/>
respectful with kids as we are, so we thought an unschooler would be  <br/>
perfect – we also unschool our kids (as far as German law allows).<br/>
<br/>
Does any one happen to know anybody who&#39;d like to spend a year in  <br/>
Germany? Working as an Au-Pair...<br/>
<br/>
... you pay your flight here and back yourself<br/>
... you eat with the host family and have an own lockable room (has to  <br/>
be at least 8qm) in the family&#39;s home (both of which you don&#39;t have to  <br/>
pay)<br/>
... you help with household whenever it is related with the kids<br/>
... you help with the care of the kids, so the parents can work, also  <br/>
you babysit 1-2 times in the week if necessary<br/>
... you don&#39;t work more than 6 hours a day and 30 hours a week  <br/>
(babysitting included)<br/>
... you get an allowance of 260 € per month, also during vacation<br/>
... you have a vacation of 4 weeks if you stay 1 year, or else 2 days  <br/>
per month if you stay less than a year (one has to stay at least 6  <br/>
months, but we&#39;d like someone who stays a year if possible)<br/>
... you pay your own language course (in Germany German), the host  <br/>
family has to allow you time to go there<br/>
... you have at least one free day in the week, at least one of those  <br/>
in the month has to be a sunday<br/>
... you&#39;d have a real contract. All the formalities would be taken  <br/>
care of by an agency (which we can choose together), normally, the  <br/>
contact making through the agency doesn&#39;t cost anything for the Au- <br/>
Pair (but for us).<br/>
... the host family pays your health insurance, also an insurance for  <br/>
things you break or loose, and also in case you damage the kids or the  <br/>
host family in some way<br/>
... the agency normally offers cheap city tours in Europe for the Au- <br/>
Pairs and meetings with other Au-Pairs (like Rome for 175 € I don&#39;t  <br/>
know how many days, though, I guess for the weekend)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An Au-Pair does NOT:<br/>
... clean up the whole house or wash underwear of the host family :)<br/>
... take care of the kids the whole time<br/>
... make ALL meals for the whole family<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The rest will have to be accorded between us (for example, how much  <br/>
time to spend on the phone, which kinds work to do in the household  <br/>
etc.)<br/>
<br/>
You can find a lot more information on the internet of course.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Leipzig, which is a thriving city 2 car hours from Berlin.  <br/>
We&#39;ve got two kids now, 8 (she&#39;s in a school wich unschools,  <br/>
unfortunately we can&#39;t fully unschool because it is illegal in  <br/>
Germany, so it has to be in a building), and 2, a boy. I&#39;m pregnant  <br/>
now so there would be another one around end of May 2008. We both  <br/>
parents work mostly at home so you wouldn&#39;t have to stay with the kids  <br/>
the whole day alone, but rather with us. We enjoy being with our kids  <br/>
but we also really do have to work, so this is the solution we&#39;ve come  <br/>
up with :-) We don&#39;t know if you&#39;d also have to take care of the very  <br/>
little one, this depends one how well he or she would accept you,  <br/>
though you could surely carry it around in a sling :-) We are NOT very  <br/>
tidy and clean, rather messy. We don&#39;t smoke, and we wouldn&#39;t want  <br/>
someone who smokes :-) We eat in parts organic food, but only what we  <br/>
can afford. My partner is vegetarian, the rest of the family is not,  <br/>
we eat a lot of fish and don&#39;t cook much meat because it&#39;s just too  <br/>
much work to cook two dishes, but we wouldn&#39;t mind if you did cook  <br/>
your own meat. We have internet :-D and a WII and a (old) playstation.  <br/>
We do family activitites in the weekends and we especially have rather  <br/>
little time to go out with the kids during weekdays, which is what  <br/>
we&#39;d expect you to do especially with the two year old (as long as he  <br/>
wants to :-)). At nights we like to watch Star Trek or Seinfeld or  <br/>
Scrubs or Frasier or My name is Earl or The Office or anything like  <br/>
that in English, sometimes movies as well. We&#39;d be looking forward for  <br/>
your input in anything you&#39;d like to do here in Germany.<br/>
<br/>
You need to speak German in Level A1 according to regulations. With us  <br/>
and the kids you can speak English or Spanish if you feel more  <br/>
comfortable with (though  you&#39;d probably want to improve your German).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can help us, thank you very much!<br/>
<br/>
Johanna<br/>
