<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090116781">This isn&#39;t going to be a typical question, but we have had a few issues come<br/>
to the surface lately that I have been reflecting on today.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter is 7 1/2 and LOVES video games. We regulated her video<br/>
games up until about August 2007, right after she turned 7. Then we just<br/>
stopped regulating and for the most part, she gets to play whatever,<br/>
whenever and in general I have no problems with that. There are only a<br/>
couple issues where *I* need to change mindsets to be able to meet her<br/>
needs, but I am having a hard time doing so by myself.<br/>
<br/>
First issue. Eating. She doesn&#39;t like to eat unless it is something that can<br/>
be eaten at the computer/game cube while she is playing. She waits until she<br/>
is &quot;starving&quot; before she realizes she is hungry and then she comes and wants<br/>
me to make her something, but it has to be like 5 minutes ago. I know that I<br/>
should be anticipating when she is hungry and offer her things in between<br/>
and I am working on that. My issue is that when I do make her something in<br/>
which she can eat at said gaming station she takes 2 or 3 bites and forgets<br/>
about it. Then by the time she realizes she is hungry again whatever I made<br/>
her is too gross to eat. What can I do? Smaller portions? That&#39;s all I could<br/>
think of. (Well, that and giving her the same old boring thing to eat every<br/>
time she wants something at the computer so that she will want something<br/>
else and come eat with us, but we gave that idea up because we felt that it<br/>
was too manipulative).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, this eating thing happens in the &quot;mornings&quot; when she wakes up too. She<br/>
stays up late and gets up late which isn&#39;t a problem. She gets up about<br/>
11-11:30 in the morning and comes downstairs VERY hungry. Usually I am in<br/>
the middle of making lunch so I end up asking her to wait until lunch is<br/>
done, but she is too hungry for that, but I feel I just can&#39;t stop what I am<br/>
in the middle of (lunch is the main meal here at this house because dh works<br/>
2nds so it takes a few minutes and a good amount of my attention). She is<br/>
also not one to want to get things for herself. She wants us to do it for<br/>
her still. I think she still feels like she lacks the coordination or<br/>
something. Especially after busting open a full gallon of milk about a week<br/>
ago. I can&#39;t blame her for still wanting us to get it, so we do.<br/>
<br/>
Second issue. She rarely wants to leave. It&#39;s almost like every time we<br/>
leave we are stealing away her time for gaming. We try setting a timer for<br/>
her and that helps. She complies. But only because she has to and I wonder<br/>
if that is why she is &quot;holding onto&quot; the video games &quot;longer&quot; in this<br/>
&quot;deschooling process&quot; or whatever it is. As far as leaving the house goes, I<br/>
know it isn&#39;t necessarily fair that we ask her to come with us, but<br/>
honestly, we are accustomed to doing things as a family. We have always gone<br/>
and did things, all four of us. Even running errands, grocery shopping, the<br/>
whole nine yards. She says going to the store is boring now (so we don&#39;t<br/>
typically take her anymore). Sometimes though, the errands have to include<br/>
both Roger and I. What do we do then?<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, she hits yelling and near melt down mode if we ask to use<br/>
the computer for a minute while she is on. Generally, she has full rein of<br/>
the computer from the time she gets up, until she goes to bed at night, BUT<br/>
heaven forbid if we need to use the computer for anything. For example, I<br/>
did my SIL&#39;s taxes last year and she called me asking me to send them to her<br/>
by email. I told Marti that I needed to use the computer for a second and<br/>
got hostility in response. I don&#39;t know how to handle this hostility because<br/>
it just makes me want to revert back to my old parenting ways.<br/>
<br/>
We even have two computers and her favorite games (mainly Furcadia) is<br/>
installed on both computers, but the files on the &quot;good&quot; (ie faster, so it<br/>
gets used the most) computer are not accessible from the Compaq (the &quot;bad&quot;<br/>
computer) because the network is not working properly even though we have<br/>
tried many times to fix that. So, theoretically she could go to the Compaq,<br/>
although I do know that is a lot to ask so I try not to.<br/>
<br/>
I think that is it for her.<br/>
<br/>
Now, just a quick question on the imaginary friends topic. My youngest has<br/>
this imaginary &quot;friend&quot; named Grandma-Aunt Shell (not sure whether this is a<br/>
grandma or an aunt, it changes from moment to moment, but that isn&#39;t the<br/>
issue). Now the past three days in a row she has told me that she wants me<br/>
to take her to this person&#39;s house. I don&#39;t really know what to say, so I<br/>
say &quot;I don&#39;t know where she lives&quot; and she tells me that she will show me<br/>
how to get there. Do I take her out and really try to let her show me where<br/>
this person lives or do you think... I don&#39;t know. What would you do?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch everyone!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106479501">Hi Amanda, Our family is really new to unschooling so I don&#39;t have much experience to offer you, but a few things came to my mind reading your email.<br/>
   <br/>
  I read a story in Life Learning magazine about a family who decided to stop regulating their son&#39;s tv viewing.  He spent 6 months straight just watching tv, with them trusting him and sometimes wondering if that&#39;s all he would ever choose to do again, then one day just didn&#39;t turn the tv on, and his tv watching has been off and on ever since.  I really believe the whole dynamic of restriction can take a long time to work out of someone&#39;s system.  My mom totally restriced sugar, and I&#39;m 41 and still working on that one! :o)<br/>
   <br/>
  Smaller portions with the food sounds ideal to me.  And it sounds like she may lack confidence in the kitchen.  Would she like to choose a recipe and cook it with you or her dad to have a &#39;success&#39; in the kitchen?  Perhaps something she really likes?  Just a thought.<br/>
   <br/>
  And I would certainly get in the car and get my child to show me where her imaginary friend lives.  I would be *so* curious!  I&#39;ve heard some amazing stories about the inner lives of smaller children and their &#39;knowing&#39;.<br/>
   <br/>
  Like I said, we&#39;ve only been unschooing a short while, but these are some of my thoughts.<br/>
   <br/>
  All the best!<br/>
   <br/>
  Jodi <br/>

   <br/>
  &#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=<br/>
   <br/>
  Glad you get it that you can only change YOUR mindset!<br/>
   <br/>
  &#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=<br/>
   <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>

was too manipulative) .<br/>
   <br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
  Again glad you are not trying to manipulate her!!LOL;)<br/>
   <br/>
  When my 5 yo ds is playing and really into the game  I bring him food and drinks every 2-3hours. Most what I bring is a &quot;goody&#39;s plate&quot; as he calls it. I put in, apple pieces, cheese, Little bread squares ( any topping you want), chips, cereal, crackers, egg white, baby carrots you name it. All in little bite sizes.<br/>
   <br/>
  I also bring him lunch and many times I just hand feed him while he plays. He eats , he is happy and I am happy . We also talk about how when you are hungry you don&#39;t play as good as you can because all your body and you head need the nutrients to do their best.<br/>
   <br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, this eating thing happens in the &quot;mornings&quot; when she wakes up too. She<br/>
stays up late and gets up late which isn&#39;t a problem. She gets up about<br/>
11-11:30 in the morning and comes downstairs VERY hungry. Usually I am in<br/>

her still. I think she still feels like she lacks the coordination or<br/>
something. Especially after busting open a full gallon of milk about a week<br/>
ago. I can&#39;t blame her for still wanting us to get it, so we do.<br/>
   <br/>
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=<br/>
   <br/>
  Have something ready for her then, or just fix something easy while you are making lunch. <br/>
I am not a chef ( but have several in my family ( including brother and BIL) but it is very doable to get something ready very quick WHILE you make something else.<br/>
  You can do it. No excuses.<br/>
   <br/>
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=--<br/>
   <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Second issue. She rarely wants to leave. It&#39;s almost like every time we<br/>
leave we are stealing away her time for gaming. We try setting a timer for<br/>
her and that helps. She complies. But only because she has to and I wonder<br/>
if that is why she is &quot;holding onto&quot; the video games &quot;longer&quot; in this<br/>
&quot;deschooling process&quot; or whatever it is. As far as leaving the house goes, I<br/>
know it isn&#39;t necessarily fair that we ask her to come with us, but<br/>
honestly, we are accustomed to doing things as a family. We have always gone<br/>

whole nine yards. She says going to the store is boring now (so we don&#39;t<br/>

both Roger and I. What do we do then?<br/>
   <br/>
  =&#92;&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  My ds gets like that too. Friday I wanted to go take them to play at out club ( awesome kids area) and his friends where going to be there. He did not want to. I stayed home. No big deal. DH went grocery shopping even thou I wanted to go to and got what we needed.<br/>
  My ds also have a Nintendo DS that makes going out easier for him when he is in a video game mode.<br/>
  Sometimes he will take his ds and play it only in the car. But I think because I have listened to him and d&#92;stayed home many times when he asked he is more willing to come when we need to.<br/>
  Because your dd had video games limited in her life ( my ds never had anything limited) it is probably harder for her to let go. Little by little she will begin to trust that you will not limit her again and she will be able to let go when you need. But there will be times when won&#39;t.<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  =-=-=--=-=-=-=-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, she hits yelling and near melt down mode if we ask to use<br/>
the computer for a minute while she is on. Generally, she has full rein of<br/>
the computer from the time she gets up, until she goes to bed at night, BUT<br/>
heaven forbid if we need to use the computer for anything. For example, I<br/>
did my SIL&#39;s taxes last year and she called me asking me to send them to her<br/>
by email. I told Marti that I needed to use the computer for a second and<br/>
got hostility in response. I don&#39;t know how to handle this hostility because<br/>
it just makes me want to revert back to my old parenting ways.<br/>
<br/>
We even have two computers and her favorite games (mainly Furcadia) is<br/>
installed on both computers, but the files on the &quot;good&quot; (ie faster, so it<br/>
gets used the most) computer are not accessible from the Compaq (the &quot;bad&quot;<br/>
computer) because the network is not working properly even though we have<br/>
tried many times to fix that. So, theoretically she could go to the Compaq,<br/>
although I do know that is a lot to ask so I try not to.<br/>
   <br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-<br/>
  Can YOU use the &quot;bad&quot; computer??? Can you get her another computer?<br/>
  Also if she is concentrated in her game and you want her to stop so you can used it that can be frustrating to a young child. My ds just gave me a couple of minutes to write this e-mail. He has been very generous today but I know that if he was really into a new thing it would not have gone so smooth. <br/>
<br/>
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
I think that is it for her.<br/>
<br/>
Now, just a quick question on the imaginary friends topic. My youngest has<br/>
this imaginary &quot;friend&quot; named Grandma-Aunt Shell (not sure whether this is a<br/>
grandma or an aunt, it changes from moment to moment, but that isn&#39;t the<br/>
issue). Now the past three days in a row she has told me that she wants me<br/>
to take her to this person&#39;s house. I don&#39;t really know what to say, so I<br/>
say &quot;I don&#39;t know where she lives&quot; and she tells me that she will show me<br/>
how to get there. Do I take her out and really try to let her show me where<br/>
this person lives or do you think... I don&#39;t know. What would you do?<br/>
<br/>
   <br/>

<h4>BRIAN POLIKOWSKY</h4>
<p><small><time> 3 Feb 2008, at 11:36am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-49759965">My oldest daughter is 7 1/2 and LOVES video games. We regulated her video<br/>
games up until about August 2007, right after she turned 7. Then we just<br/>
stopped regulating and for the most part, she gets to play whatever,<br/>
whenever and in general I have no problems with that. There are only a<br/>
couple issues where *I* need to change mindsets to be able to meet her<br/>
needs, but I am having a hard time doing so by myself.<br/>
   <br/>
  &#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=<br/>
   <br/>
  Glad you get it that you can only change YOUR mindset!<br/>
   <br/>
  &#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=<br/>
   <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
First issue. Eating. She doesn&#39;t like to eat unless it is something that can<br/>
be eaten at the computer/game cube while she is playing. She waits until she<br/>
is &quot;starving&quot; before she realizes she is hungry and then she comes and wants<br/>
me to make her something, but it has to be like 5 minutes ago. I know that I<br/>
should be anticipating when she is hungry and offer her things in between<br/>
and I am working on that. My issue is that when I do make her something in<br/>
which she can eat at said gaming station she takes 2 or 3 bites and forgets<br/>
about it. Then by the time she realizes she is hungry again whatever I made<br/>
her is too gross to eat. What can I do? Smaller portions? That&#39;s all I could<br/>
think of. (Well, that and giving her the same old boring thing to eat every<br/>
time she wants something at the computer so that she will want something<br/>
else and come eat with us, but we gave that idea up because we felt that it<br/>
was too manipulative) .<br/>
   <br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
  Again glad you are not trying to manipulate her!!LOL;)<br/>
   <br/>
  When my 5 yo ds is playing and really into the game  I bring him food and drinks every 2-3hours. Most what I bring is a &quot;goody&#39;s plate&quot; as he calls it. I put in, apple pieces, cheese, Little bread squares ( any topping you want), chips, cereal, crackers, egg white, baby carrots you name it. All in little bite sizes.<br/>
   <br/>
  I also bring him lunch and many times I just hand feed him while he plays. He eats , he is happy and I am happy . We also talk about how when you are hungry you don&#39;t play as good as you can because all your body and you head need the nutrients to do their best.<br/>
   <br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, this eating thing happens in the &quot;mornings&quot; when she wakes up too. She<br/>
stays up late and gets up late which isn&#39;t a problem. She gets up about<br/>
11-11:30 in the morning and comes downstairs VERY hungry. Usually I am in<br/>
the middle of making lunch so I end up asking her to wait until lunch is<br/>
done, but she is too hungry for that, but I feel I just can&#39;t stop what I am<br/>
in the middle of (lunch is the main meal here at this house because DH works<br/>
2nds so it takes a few minutes and a good amount of my attention). She is<br/>
also not one to want to get things for herself. She wants us to do it for<br/>
her still. I think she still feels like she lacks the coordination or<br/>
something. Especially after busting open a full gallon of milk about a week<br/>
ago. I can&#39;t blame her for still wanting us to get it, so we do.<br/>
   <br/>
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=<br/>
   <br/>
  Have something ready for her then, or just fix something easy while you are making lunch. <br/>
I am not a chef ( but have several in my family ( including brother and BIL) but it is very doable to get something ready very quick WHILE you make something else.<br/>
  You can do it. No excuses.<br/>
   <br/>
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=--<br/>
   <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Second issue. She rarely wants to leave. It&#39;s almost like every time we<br/>
leave we are stealing away her time for gaming. We try setting a timer for<br/>
her and that helps. She complies. But only because she has to and I wonder<br/>
if that is why she is &quot;holding onto&quot; the video games &quot;longer&quot; in this<br/>
&quot;deschooling process&quot; or whatever it is. As far as leaving the house goes, I<br/>
know it isn&#39;t necessarily fair that we ask her to come with us, but<br/>
honestly, we are accustomed to doing things as a family. We have always gone<br/>
and did things, all four of us. Even running errands, grocery shopping, the<br/>
whole nine yards. She says going to the store is boring now (so we don&#39;t<br/>
typically take her anymore). Sometimes though, the errands have to include<br/>
both Roger and I. What do we do then?<br/>
   <br/>
  =&#92;&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  My ds gets like that too. Friday I wanted to go take them to play at out club ( awesome kids area) and his friends where going to be there. He did not want to. I stayed home. No big deal. DH went grocery shopping even thou I wanted to go to and got what we needed.<br/>
  My ds also have a Nintendo DS that makes going out easier for him when he is in a video game mode.<br/>
  Sometimes he will take his ds and play it only in the car. But I think because I have listened to him and d&#92;stayed home many times when he asked he is more willing to come when we need to.<br/>
  Because your dd had video games limited in her life ( my ds never had anything limited) it is probably harder for her to let go. Little by little she will begin to trust that you will not limit her again and she will be able to let go when you need. But there will be times when won&#39;t.<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  =-=-=--=-=-=-=-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, she hits yelling and near melt down mode if we ask to use<br/>
the computer for a minute while she is on. Generally, she has full rein of<br/>
the computer from the time she gets up, until she goes to bed at night, BUT<br/>
heaven forbid if we need to use the computer for anything. For example, I<br/>
did my SIL&#39;s taxes last year and she called me asking me to send them to her<br/>
by email. I told Marti that I needed to use the computer for a second and<br/>
got hostility in response. I don&#39;t know how to handle this hostility because<br/>
it just makes me want to revert back to my old parenting ways.<br/>
<br/>
We even have two computers and her favorite games (mainly Furcadia) is<br/>
installed on both computers, but the files on the &quot;good&quot; (ie faster, so it<br/>
gets used the most) computer are not accessible from the Compaq (the &quot;bad&quot;<br/>
computer) because the network is not working properly even though we have<br/>
tried many times to fix that. So, theoretically she could go to the Compaq,<br/>
although I do know that is a lot to ask so I try not to.<br/>
   <br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-<br/>
  Can YOU use the &quot;bad&quot; computer??? Can you get her another computer?<br/>
  Also if she is concentrated in her game and you want her to stop so you can used it that can be frustrating to a young child. My ds just gave me a couple of minutes to write this e-mail. He has been very generous today but I know that if he was really into a new thing it would not have gone so smooth. <br/>
<br/>
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
I think that is it for her.<br/>
<br/>
Now, just a quick question on the imaginary friends topic. My youngest has<br/>
this imaginary &quot;friend&quot; named Grandma-Aunt Shell (not sure whether this is a<br/>
grandma or an aunt, it changes from moment to moment, but that isn&#39;t the<br/>
issue). Now the past three days in a row she has told me that she wants me<br/>
to take her to this person&#39;s house. I don&#39;t really know what to say, so I<br/>
say &quot;I don&#39;t know where she lives&quot; and she tells me that she will show me<br/>
how to get there. Do I take her out and really try to let her show me where<br/>
this person lives or do you think... I don&#39;t know. What would you do?<br/>
<br/>
   <br/>
  =-=-=-=-----=-=-=-<br/>
  Like someone said. Go drive to the friends house and see where it leads you. It may be a fun adventure. <br/>

Duncan never had an imaginary friend. Cameron did though.<br/>
<br/>
He called him &quot;the Boy&quot; for months. Sometimes he wouldn&#39;t go into his <br/>
room or the living room because &quot;the Boy&quot; was in there. This went on <br/>
for months. Months and months. Finally, I got him to ask &quot;the Boy&quot; what <br/>
his name was. After several weeks of being too afraid to ask him, <br/>
Cameron said his name was &quot;Willie.&quot; Willie sometimes lived with us and <br/>
sometimes traveled. Occasionally we&#39;d see him on the side of the road <br/>
and have to stop to pick him up. Willie had certain foods he liked and <br/>
certain blankets that he preferred. Overall, Willie was a pretty cool <br/>
dude. It just took a while to get to know Willie and to not be afraid <br/>
of this imaginary stranger/friend.<br/>
<br/>
I miss Willie now. Willie told long stories that Cameron could retell <br/>
to me. Willie was funny and well-traveled and liked ice cream. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

                Have you thought about what you are going to say to your son if you drive him to where he says his friend lives and he gets out of the car and wants knock on the door? <br/>
   <br/>
               I am all for Imaginary friends, sometimes we just need them in our lives. Our DS 6 uses his action figures as his friends sometimes. Do you know how hard it is to make a sandwich for a guy that is only 6 inches tall.LOL When it comes to drinks, I tell my son he has to share his drink with him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032782408">Ah, yes, imaginary friends...<br/>
 <br/>
When Julian was quite little he had a series. There was Tanya, who was male  <br/>
and lived in an apartment that we passed when we rode the train into Boston.  <br/>
Then there was Tree, who was dead. Apparently always had been, or something. <br/>
He  was a weird kid.<br/>
 <br/>
But he has weird parents too. As the Old-Timers might recall ( Here,  picture <br/>
Kathryn spitting out some chewing tobaccy and tugging on the straps of  her <br/>
overalls), Julian had a community of squirrels that lived in his thick curly  <br/>
hair. They all had names like Jo and Flo and Bo. (We have suggested that if  <br/>
Julian ever has children that his partner should be in charge of names. His Sims <br/>
 characters had names like Glork.)<br/>
 <br/>
The thing about those squirrels...I swear they were real. We&#39;d have  <br/>
conversations with them. It was weird. This went on a LONG time.<br/>
 <br/>
You know, the kid&#39;s awesome, but he was much more fun before he got  Dignity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586714387">Hi! I am Jacquie 38,happily married to Jeff, a journeyman Electrician <br/>
for 10 years and we teach our 7 year old son Jonah. We are <br/>
eclectic/unschool but want to go unschool more. We believe in Child led <br/>
learnin- if they are not interested in learning it- wait he will gewt <br/>
there!<br/>
   Jonah had an imiginary friend called mouse who, yes, was a mouse. He <br/>
had Mouse a couple of years and suddenly Mouse was gone. We got a <br/>
Hamster we tried to name Mouse bu it did not stick. It was fun while it <br/>
lasted. Now his home playmates are a Bassett Hound named Flash we <br/>
adopted almost a year ago form Bassett Rescue who is almost 7. A Pug <br/>
who is almost 8 named Sadie who we got free when she was 3. Four cats- <br/>
Ashley 11, Lisa & Tia (both gray- only Jonah can really tell them <br/>
apart, but they are his!) both 1, and Mittens who is a few months, a <br/>
bunny named Mr. Buttons and the hamster.<br/>
    Jonah&#39;s intersts now are the Titanic, GI Joe, Netflix <br/>
movies,reading Dick & Jane books. <br/>
My interests are Knittng (taught myself 7 years ago an still learning)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671188777">My now 17 yr old had an imaginary friend when she was 3 or 4.... his<br/>
name was &quot;baby fish&quot; and he was the culprit for most mischief at our<br/>
house.   He was frequently responsible for her seatbelt not being<br/>
fastened properly (or at all! these were the days when at age 4 they<br/>
could sit in a seatbelt)    He was frequently the one that hid<br/>
shoes...especially ballet slippers moments before heading out the door<br/>
even though they had been left in the dance bag the week before!   <br/>
He also wrote on a few walls, took cookies he decided later not to eat<br/>
and was frequently thrown under the bus by his friend for things she<br/>
clearly did!    It was always funny they way she would query... &quot;mommy<br/>
I think Baby fish may have broken that lamp... do you think he will<br/>
get a time out?&quot;   (OK those were the days when I was a very different<br/>
parent... I have recovered from those days! )   Anyway it was pretty<br/>
funny because baby fish had a much more interesting life than the rest<br/>
of us!   He also seemed to visit and cause more mischief right around<br/>
the birth of any new baby at our house!   We got used to the little<br/>
fellow... kind of miss him!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for bringing back some fond memories!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470840375"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Jonah had an imiginary friend called mouse who, yes, was a mouse<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL I had a cat for many years who was named Mouse - when she was a wee<br/>
kitten, her body started to grow but her head stayed disproportionately<br/>
small for a while (it took a while for her head to grow into her body<br/>
size) and that made her look a lot like a rodent. Her name was<br/>
originally Dutchess - I named her that because even for a wee one, she<br/>
looked &#39;regal&#39;. My dad thought it was funny because I lived in a town<br/>
called Windsor at the time, so he&#39;d ask how the Dutchess of Windsor was<br/>
doing :-) But Mouse just &#39;stuck&#39;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-18456806">An imaginary friend wasn&#39;t good enough for my son when he was about 3 <br/>
or 4 years old.  He had an imaginary COUNTRY!!  He&#39;d lived in France, <br/>
you know, for 10 years.  He used to live there with Steve and they <br/>
had this mad 3 story apartment with a whole floor just for games and <br/>
stuff.  I had to keep reminding his big brothers not to discredit his <br/>
stories because his imagination was important to him. I used to have <br/>
some great conversations with him full of &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;ahs&quot; and &quot;oh <br/>
really&#39;s!!!&quot;  It was kinda fun.  I knew he&#39;d grow out of it and was <br/>
kinda sad when he did, actually.<br/>
