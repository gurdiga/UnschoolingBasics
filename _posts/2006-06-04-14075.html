<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352595434">&quot;I do know, though, that the people I tend to hang out with, the<br/>
ones I put effort into getting to know better and spend time<br/>
with---those people are almost always more intelligent than I am.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
HA!! Don&#39;t let her fool you folks.:) She&#39;s usually prodding and poking<br/>
and helping US do/be/live MORE!!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know many people on earth that are into as many things as<br/>
Kelly Lovejoy. But don&#39;t let that intimidate you, pick her brain!!<br/>
It&#39;s huge.;)<br/>
<br/>
About the whole &quot;but&quot; discussion....it wasn&#39;t REALLY about the word,<br/>
it was about negating the apology. I&#39;ve done it.<br/>
When we apologize to someone then add the word &quot;but&quot;, it DOES negate<br/>
the whole apology because we&#39;re making an excuse for our behavior or<br/>
blaming the other person.<br/>
<br/>
I catch myself STILL!! I&#39;ll apologize and want to say &quot;BUT, you blah,<br/>
blah blah.&quot;<br/>
Luckily I can catch it BEFORE it is voices now.<br/>
<br/>
This whole debate on word usage is just a side discussion really. We<br/>
tend to do that around here...damn unschoolers,  gotta debate and<br/>
discuss EVERYTHING! Ha...<br/>
<br/>
I just got a phone call from my sis because her and my nephew were<br/>
having a debate on Polygamist vs. Bigamist. I wasn&#39;t sure. It turned<br/>
into a great discussion (Kevin was right), looking stuff up on Google<br/>
and learning something new.  It isn&#39;t so important WHAT you know (that<br/>
isn&#39;t what intelligence really is about anyway), it&#39;s important to be<br/>
CURIOUS and open!!!<br/>
