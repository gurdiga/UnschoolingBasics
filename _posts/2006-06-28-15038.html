<div id="ygrps-yiv-469223399">What to do? What to do? My intent is not to offend anyone here, so I hope I <br/>
get my point across while still being respectful...<br/>
<br/>
My mother is very religious. I don&#39;t have a problem with that. I am not <br/>
religious. She has a HUGE problem with that. I used to be religious and I <br/>
don&#39;t have a problem with others seeking out comfort in religion and a <br/>
relationship with God. It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t believe in it anymore and I <br/>
have a hard time feigning belief or interest in the stories in the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
My son is 2 and LOVES LOVES LOVES books of all kinds. My mother consistently <br/>
sends him religious books for children (Veggie Tales, a first Bible, other <br/>
Bible Stories with cartoon-ish drawings, etc.). So far, I have to admit, I <br/>
have been donating them to other kids in local charities or giving them to <br/>
the Mission downtown. I have never shown them to him and since my mother is <br/>
all the way across the country (I&#39;m in Los Angeles and she&#39;s in Ohio), she <br/>
is never the wiser...<br/>
<br/>
My newly unschooly self is beginning to feel not so honest and upfront with <br/>
my son about this and I want him to make up his own mind about religion. <br/>
Should he choose to be religious, that&#39;s fine with me. It&#39;s just difficult <br/>
for me to present these ideas to him because of my own issues with religion. <br/>
I just got home a few minutes ago and found a huge box full of new religious <br/>
children&#39;s books. It&#39;s like my mom has a video camera here and knows that I <br/>
don&#39;t give them to him... she&#39;s replenishing the inventory. My son is <br/>
napping now so he doesn&#39;t know that I have a bunch of new books. He might <br/>
even like them...<br/>
<br/>
Please give me some perspective on how to view this situation. How would you <br/>
handle it? I&#39;m feeling like I should provide them for him so that he can <br/>
make up his own mind over time. How do you get past the prejudices or biases <br/>
you might have about a particular subject for the sake of your child&#39;s <br/>
freedom to learn and choose their own paths?  Thanks in advance!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your son is how old?  Two?  I think it is important that you talk to<br/>
your mother and tell her in respectful language that you know that she<br/>
loves you and cares for you and your son.  You appreciate her<br/>
thoughtfulness in sending him books and other presents (I&#39;m sure).<br/>
Then say, &quot;I feel disrespected when religious material is sent to our<br/>
home when  you know that we don&#39;t agree on the matter of religion.&quot;<br/>
This is YOUR home.  Yes; we are unschoolers, but even on the subject<br/>
of religion we are allowed opinions and the ability to express those<br/>
opinions to your child when you feel your child is old enough to be<br/>
able to look at things objectively.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had this same discussion with my own mother.  My mom is an<br/>
Episcopal priest.  Over the years she has greatly mellowed, but when<br/>
she first started sending religious things to my home I had to put a<br/>
stop to it.  She was spending her money for things that my children<br/>
would never get.  I also felt that while I respected her religion in<br/>
her home (bowing my head for prayers and not talking about my<br/>
religious beliefs in her home) I expected the same respect from her in<br/>
my home.  I would never gift my mom with a pentacle no matter how<br/>
beautiful I thought it was.  I would never give my mom a book written<br/>
by some eclectic Pagan author because I know that to her it was deemed<br/>
evil.  Fortunately, my mom has come a long way and now is much more<br/>
unitarian in her beliefs.  It took us a LONG time to get to that<br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
It all comes down to respect and you need to establish that respect<br/>
now while your son is young so that it doesn&#39;t become a battling<br/>
ground when he is older.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409049278">I wouldn&#39;t even look at it as religion, I would look at it as gifts  <br/>
from his grandmother. If he chooses to read through them, it should  <br/>
be easy to just bite your tongue and do it. If he doesn&#39;t like them,  <br/>
then you aren&#39;t the one choosing, he is. And if he has some he really  <br/>
likes, then you can take pleasure in his pleasure. Veggietale books  <br/>
aren&#39;t always blatantly religious, we have some good math and telling  <br/>
time ones that the kids like. And even the really religious ones,  <br/>
like &quot;Where&#39;s God when I&#39;m scared?&quot; address issues that many children  <br/>
face, and help. Even if YOU don&#39;t face it from a Christian aspect, it  <br/>
can open the door to discussions with him about why or why not some  <br/>
people are scared of the dark, other fears that sometimes pop up,  <br/>
way&#39;s we can help those we love, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Something that this reminds me of, in my autism group there is a set  <br/>
of parents who are athiests, very strongly so. Their son with  <br/>
aspergers really needed a religious experience, he desired  <br/>
explanations for the beginning of all, and the science wasn&#39;t enough.  <br/>
So they did have to break out of their comfort level, experiment with  <br/>
several churches, and they found one that they were not too offended  <br/>
by. They enjoyed the community aspect, and he was able to learn and  <br/>
experience more. I don&#39;t know how you can &#39;get past it&#39; but I think  <br/>
it&#39;s important to let your children be exposed to alternatives safely  <br/>
and knowing that you will support them regardless. Right?<br/>
<br/>
Just mindlessly spilling now. Sorry ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-176592185">When you say &quot;religious&quot; I assume you&#39;re talking about a certain kind of Christianity. There are other religions besides that one. Plus there are way to explore spirituality that involve no rligion at all.<br/>
<br/>
We handled this like we handled all other learning. We made things available and let the kids choose what to explore. So I had the books on Judaism my mil sent along with my childhood Bible along with The Tao of Pooh and a book of world religions. We talked about it all. We sometimes were able to see different places of worship or participate in other people&#39;s ceremonies with them. From my own belief system, I never presented any one way as the &quot;only&quot; way. That&#39;s what I choose to pass along to my kids.<br/>

I wish my Mom was still alive to send ANYTHING to my kids, anything would be <br/>
soooooo wonderfully sweet. Although my mil has everyone at her work believing <br/>
that she is this Super Grandma who spends every chance she gets with her <br/>
grandkids, them and herself are the only ones she is fooling. She has absolutely no <br/>
time for them at all and my kids feelings have been hurt more than once.<br/>
<br/>
You did not offend me here, just wanting you to think about your Mom and your <br/>
son at the same time. You are keeping part of his Grandmother from him. Do <br/>
you really think he is going to be worse off at 2 yrs. old if he looks at a few <br/>
books about God any way? I don&#39;t know how your Mom thinks about God, but I <br/>
don&#39;t think of God as a &quot;religion&quot; at all, religion is not God, &quot;religion&quot; is man <br/>
made. (just my point of view&lt;g&gt;) I would just give him whatever his grandmom <br/>
sent him and not tell him they are &quot;religious&quot; books one way or another. They <br/>
are a gift from Grandma, she loves you SO much!  I found that the bigger deal <br/>
you make about things, the bigger deal those things are going to be.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You give him that freedom by giving him gifts from someone who loves him. (If <br/>
it were something that would be detrimental to my kids in any way then no, of <br/>
course I wouldn&#39;t give them the gifts.) I have a sil that was Wiccan for <br/>
years (she is now Hindu) and she used to (actually still does) get SO upset <br/>
whenever anyone would talk about God to or around her and her kids. She was also one <br/>
who used to constantly preach that &quot;we need to have more peace and <br/>
*tollerance* in this world.&quot; Her kids are now a bit older and they seem like they <br/>
survived it all ok. Only, they still aren&#39;t sure if they are supposed to be Wiccan <br/>
or change to Hinduism. I&#39;m guessing they will choose their own paths as they <br/>
grow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443786949">We handle unsolicited religious gifts by balancing them out with books and<br/>
toys from other religions.<br/>
<br/>
When Gramma gives a book on Christ in the spring, we&#39;ve already checked out<br/>
books from the library on the pagan roots of the Easter celebration.  When<br/>
the baby Jesus stuff comes at Christmas, we&#39;re in the midst of exploring<br/>
winter holidays like Solstice, Chanukah, Kwanzaa, Ramadan, Diwali,<br/>
Saturnalia, etc, etc.  We&#39;re making dredels and latkes, leaving a feast out<br/>
in the trees for the birds and bears and deer, doing yoga, chanting, rubbing<br/>
our Buddha, and lighting our candles and lanterns, so one more gifted<br/>
nativity is no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, because we have no religious affiliation, I make sure that no one<br/>
religious agenda is over-represented and if it is, I make sure to put things<br/>
up on the top shelf of the guest room closet to bring down later if I&#39;m<br/>
running low on Christian stuff or if the boys ask questions or show a sudden<br/>
interest.  I try to make religious exploration fun and interesting for them,<br/>
just as I would for any other area of interest.  More than anything else, I<br/>
don&#39;t want my own biases to hinder my kids, in religious exploration, and in<br/>
all of our pursuits.  I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m 100% successful, mind you, but it&#39;s<br/>
my goal.  If I put aside my own prejudices, I find that I can treat<br/>
religious gifts like any other gift, and I can be gracious to the people who<br/>
care about our family, however ungracious they may sometimes be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724030880">Hi, Lesa.  I plan to treat the topic the same as any other.  I <br/>
recall being very interested in religion as a child (and mysticism), <br/>
from a very early age of 5 or 6 so I want to be ready (and open) for <br/>
my daughter if she takes the same interest.  I just want to have <br/>
books about all kinds of religions & philosophy around my house - <br/>
both children&#39;s books & adult books (I liked adult books as a sm <br/>
child), so she will have the option to read them when she wants.  <br/>
<br/>
Last year, a couple mos before my daughter&#39;s 3rd bday, I picked up <br/>
two books by the same author, &quot;What is Religion&quot; & &quot;What is Death&quot;, <br/>
both of which she occasionally likes to have read to her.  They are <br/>
not story books, just facts, and a bit wordy for a 2-3 yr old, but <br/>
she has asked to read them 4 or 5 times since we first boughht them <br/>
so I know she doesn&#39;t hate them, lol.  They address the perspectives <br/>
of about 5 commonly known religions and athiesm.  I also have books <br/>
about Jesus & some holiday books on Hannakuh(sp?), and plan to <br/>
gather more story type books on other religions or philosophy&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I may need to introduce myself. I&#39;ve been on various boards <br/>
a long time, but haven&#39;t been active the last year or so due to <br/>
personal issues.  Since the new digests are so kick ass, I&#39;ve <br/>
decided to dig back into reading at least one new group, and this <br/>
seemed a great starting point.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 3 1/2, we plan to unschool.  I hang out at parkdays <br/>
with other unschoolers, chat/stay active on at least one other <br/>
unschool board, and try to read up anywhere I can in my free time.  <br/>
While deep down I feel confident that unschooling is right & best, I <br/>
seem to have great resistance, externally, in many of my actions. I <br/>
have faith it will all sink in with time, practice, and work. <br/>
<br/>
Cheryl <br/>
(mamma to Natalie, 10/02)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have always been interested in religions, sprituality, and since I <br/>
started out as a christian, I embrace it&#39;s part in my journey.  With <br/>
that in mind, I have been purchasing books that cover several <br/>
religions, or spirituality, in general.  My daughter is 3 1/2. Last <br/>
year, a couple mos before her 3rd bday, I ordered 2 books by the <br/>
same authors, &quot;what is God&quot; & &quot;What is Death&quot;.  I thought they <br/>
sounded too advanced but wanted them around just in case, or for <br/>
future use. Our order was split up, and when the God book arrived   <br/>
I looked it over & it definitely seemed too advanced for her.  <br/>
Hwoever, she saw it in the box & knew it was a &quot;present&quot;, lol, and <br/>
wanted to read it.  So we gave it a test drive.  I was surprised she <br/>
liked it, the topic seemed a bit too *boring*, and there was not a <br/>
story line, and it was a wordier book than the others we were <br/>
reading.  But it stuck, to a small degree.  She asked to read it two <br/>
or three more times in the next couple weeks.  Then it got lost in <br/>
the sea of books, as often happens with her books if they&#39;re not a <br/>
big favorite.  Since then, she has still come across it & asked to <br/>
read it, and she remembers the books names (bible, torah, etc), and <br/>
Budah, mohammed, Jesus, it&#39;s funny to me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230095038">I&#39;d keep the Bible Stories books and read them to him. It&#39;s cultural history. <br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;religion&quot; no matter what your mother&#39;s intent was in <br/>
sending them.<br/>
<br/>
There are hundreds of thousands of literary references (and jokes!) that <br/>
people can&#39;t understand if they haven&#39;t ever heard the story of Adam and Eve, or <br/>
Moses in the bulrushes, or Noah, or...  <br/>
<br/>
The best way to deal with the religion issue, in my opinion, is to talk about <br/>
ALL of them. Read creation stories from all over the world. Talk about what <br/>
people believe in different religions. Talk about what they DO, the rituals and <br/>
ceremonies. Exploring it all is better (and more fun) than trying to ignore <br/>
it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702252924">Thanks, everyone, as always. I think I was just overwhelmed with the <br/>
ton of books that came spilling out all over the floor and my newly <br/>
unschooled brain was beginning to tell me that I should open my mind <br/>
a bit more and not restrict these items.<br/>
<br/>
I had forgotten that before I had children my husband and I <br/>
discussed how we would handle discussing holidays and it always <br/>
seemed important and natural to include all the ways holidays are <br/>
celebrated around the world. Thanks for helping me see the <br/>
connection to incorporating different religions into the picture <br/>
when this issue arises.<br/>
<br/>
This group is such a valuable resource. I&#39;m happy to be able to <br/>
reach out and get responses so quickly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080535621">Lesa,<br/>
<br/>
I became a pagan 5 years ago--previously I was a Catholic.  We were never<br/>
very religious but the kids know the basic Bible stories and such.  Since I<br/>
changed my beliefs, the older kids at first said that they are still<br/>
Catholic, and that was fine with me.  Then they said they just believe in<br/>
God, and that was also fine with me. Now they are all saying they are<br/>
atheists---which I think is pretty normal for many 16-18 year olds at some<br/>
point.  My younger children ask me questions about God and Jesus (especially<br/>
after watching Jesus Christ Superstar) and I answer them truthfully with the<br/>
knowledge that I have learned.  I tell them that many people believe in God<br/>
and believe that Jesus is the son of God--I just don&#39;t follow that faith.  I<br/>
will answer any questions they have about ANY faith, if I don&#39;t know it then<br/>
I will find out for them or help them to find out the answers themselves. We<br/>
have Bibles in the house and other Christian books and they are free to read<br/>
them and learn.  All I have said to them is find whatever is right for them,<br/>
they don&#39;t have to study Druidism because I do---or Catholicism because<br/>
that&#39;s what I used to be--they don&#39;t have to be any religion.  I did ask<br/>
that someday when they are interested in a higher power, find out about<br/>
different ones and choose what is right for them.  Of course, my ex inlaws<br/>
totally contradict this because in their eyes there are no other Gods or<br/>
religions other than the Catholic Church but I just tell the kids that is<br/>
their belief and it is ok for them to have that belief--the kids are free to<br/>
believe in whatever they choose.  As far as your son goes, he is only 2 and<br/>
is happy to have books to look at and be read to---don&#39;t worry about the<br/>
content, just read the story.  Most &quot;religious&quot; childrens stories are told<br/>
to teach a moral lesson anyway and basically hold the same moralities that<br/>
anyone from any religion can agree with.  I think that even if you disagree<br/>
with the religious aspect, it is still a part of your mother and if you are<br/>
involved in a relationship with her, he is going to know that she is<br/>
religious and believes a certain way no matter what you keep from him.<br/>
There is nothing wrong (IMHO)with children learning about different<br/>
religions.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps!<br/>
