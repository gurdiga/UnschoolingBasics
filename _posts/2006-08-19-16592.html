I  don&#39;t need advice on unschooling, I need advice on how to help my  daughter<br/>
with higher math BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO  KNOW!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know the background of this post, too busy to read right now, but  <br/>
saw it and wanted to offer some thoughts.  <br/>
 <br/>
I know a 16 year old unschooler.  She wants to  start taking courses at the <br/>
local community college, here in NC you can do that  starting at age 16.  There <br/>
are some stipulations that I won&#39;t get into here  but she can&#39;t take the <br/>
remedial math classes, she must pass the entrance  test to be able to take any <br/>
classes that require a math prerequisite.  Not  sure that makes any sense but <br/>
anyway.  She wanted to be able to pass the  entrance test so she, with her mom&#39;s <br/>
help, went to the local book store and  library just looking through the math <br/>
books.  Looking for one that was  simple but not too repetitive etc.  Anyway <br/>
she found one that she liked and  has worked through it on her own.  <br/>
 <br/>
What she found is that the book store and library had  a wider selection than <br/>
the local homeschool supply store.  <br/>
