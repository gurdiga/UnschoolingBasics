<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074841206">I haven&#39;t posted here for many moons, busy doing life and having fun with my beautiful 5 year olds Jade and Skye!Â  I continue to read the daily digest though, and continue to be inspired by the writing.<br/>
<br/>
Recently I came across a musical duo that is inspiring me and helping me to be a more relaxed and unschooly mama, so perhaps it may do the same for someone else here.<br/>
<br/>
Check out www.worldofruby.com<br/>
<br/>
You can listen to an amazing song &quot;Awe&quot; at www.worldofruby.com/awe and I believe even download it for free.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy :)<br/>
<br/>
