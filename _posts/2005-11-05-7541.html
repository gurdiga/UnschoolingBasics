<div id="ygrps-yiv-968899362">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;ve been a lurker for about nine mos.  We have been officially Unschooling in everyway about a year.<br/>
 <br/>
I find it hard to hold off and work on math, whether it be games, or workbooks.  That is the hardest skill to trust on.<br/>
 <br/>
Really, how does one incorporate math skills in daily life that might take the edge off the worry?<br/>
 <br/>
They are given money...they save, they spend.  We play games.  They enjoy Pokemon and Yu-gi-oh.  They cook somewhat.  They can follow a recipe.<br/>
 <br/>
Have I answered my own question?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Christy! :-)  Yes... :-)  If one or all of your<br/>
children love it, they&#39;ll let you know and you just<br/>
give em&#39; the resources to move to higher math IF they<br/>
desire.  Unless one plans on being a mathematician,<br/>
there is no &quot;need&quot; for higher skills.  Measurements<br/>
are used in cooking and if one builds, +,-,?,* are<br/>
used in daily life as is algebra.  Money, etc., just<br/>
like you mentioned... all part of Math.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the group.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Learning,<br/>

Have I answered my own question?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YES!<br/>
Just remember all the years of torture in school and just how much<br/>
math you actually use. Most people (other than those that have some<br/>
natural passion for math) come out of school math damaged.<br/>
If your kids only have the ability to believe they&#39;re intelligent and<br/>
capable, that is enough to learn math equations at ANY time in life.<br/>
Much better than what most of us had.<br/>
<br/>
Just wait until Pam gets to respond. She&#39;s a math whiz and she&#39;s<br/>
helped a lot of us see that school is what messed up our minds and we<br/>
WEREN&#39;T idiots at math.<br/>
She&#39;s really, really good at pointing out the everyday math that<br/>
people discount. Like playing strategy games and looking at patterns<br/>
in nature etc....<br/>
<br/>
It always gets back to that trust issue though. Trust that they can<br/>
learn anything they need at any time. Trust that by living life they<br/>
will get all the &quot;basic&quot; skills they need and more. Trust your<br/>
children and their innate intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you have math fears because you yourself have problems<br/>
with math? Am I right or totally off base?<br/>
If I&#39;m right, then you just have to remember NOT to give your kids<br/>
damaging math experiences and they&#39;ll be just FINE. Truly.:)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, a couple of books that helped me in my math recovery;<br/>
I Hate Mathematics<br/>
The Joy of Mathematics<br/>
 Don&#39;t have them in front of me, so can&#39;t give you the authors at the<br/>
moment.<br/>
I also picked up this budget book one time, about turning your brain<br/>
into a calculator. It was SO cool.<br/>
It shows you how to do simple arithmetic, which school made so<br/>
challenging, and make it EASY to do in your head. It helped me a lot<br/>
with using numbers in day to day life...at least I&#39;m not using my<br/>
fingers to count very often these days. That&#39;s improvement!!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t find it at the moment either...lots of books still packed.<br/>
I&#39;ll try to find it today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-746209729">I am also &quot;math damaged&quot; from schooling.  I loved algebra, but if you <br/>
stuck numbers in, I&#39;d screw it up every time.  I think (looking back <br/>
now) that this was because of two factors, good test taking skills <br/>
(never bothered me any) and being forced to &quot;learn&quot; the math facts <br/>
before I was ready.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what I wanted to say was that I found one book that I loved <br/>
that had very interesting math in it.  A quick web search found it <br/>
for me (and I was ABOUT to post to ask if anyone could help me find <br/>
it again).  The book was &quot;Mathemagic&quot; by World Book as part of their <br/>
Childcraft series (I recommend the whole series, but this one stood <br/>
out to this day).<br/>
<br/>
It had puzzles like making Vampires and getting paid 1 gold coin <br/>
today, two tommorrow, three the day after for exponents and all kinds <br/>
of really cool practical applications of &quot;higher&quot; math.<br/>
<br/>
Now I need to find a way to get my hands on these books again... &gt;I&lt; <br/>
want to read Mathemagic (and the rest) again!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. And trust yourself to know when to offer more -- if you have a  <br/>
child who seems to really enjoy mathematical puzzles, for example,  <br/>
then you&#39;d get more of those, right? And if a kid seems to really  <br/>
enjoy and be interested in how to figure out how to add two fractions  <br/>
together, you&#39;d help him with that, right?<br/>
<br/>
The danger I see is that so many parents have school-induced math  <br/>
anxiety that causes them to avoid math. If you&#39;re avoiding it, you  <br/>
ARE doing your kids a disservice. Try to treat math JUST like you&#39;d  <br/>
treat reading. So - gosh - do you snuggle up and enjoy each other&#39;s  <br/>
company while you read together? Why not snuggle up and enjoy reading  <br/>
books that include mathematics? There are a LOT of really good ones.  <br/>
But math-anxious parents MIGHT avoid those books if they&#39;re not aware  <br/>
of their own avoidance tendencies - so you might want to make a  <br/>
special effort to INCLUDE more math-related reading material.<br/>
<br/>
Also - if you&#39;re just having fun around the house, some families will  <br/>
play with &quot;ingredients&quot; and do what amounts to science experiments  <br/>
(mixing GAK and talking/thinking about it, cleaning pennies with  <br/>
vinegar, making underwater-viewers out of milk cartons, and so on).  <br/>
Some families will have lots of animals to care for and enjoy (and  <br/>
learn about). Some will listen to a lot of music. Most of us will try  <br/>
to at least &quot;offer&quot; (strew) all kinds of different things as we  <br/>
create a rich and stimulating environment. But parents with math- <br/>
anxiety MIGHT avoid strewing/offering/bringing up things that seem  <br/>
math-related. So a conscious effort to include fun math-related  <br/>
activities might be needed.<br/>
<br/>
If we adults were already so screwed up by having had many years of  <br/>
school math, which effectively sucked all the potential joy out of  <br/>
mathematics for most people, special efforts to include math in our  <br/>
unschooling lives would not be needed.<br/>
<br/>
But - trying to be realistic, I think it is a good idea for  <br/>
unschooling parents to make sure they&#39;re not filtering math-related  <br/>
stuff OUT of their kids&#39; lives, by choosing consciously to include it.<br/>

<br/>
The Marilyn Burns books are probably better if you&#39;re just getting  <br/>
started into enjoying math - more activity-oriented, fun stuff to do  <br/>
with kids.<br/>
<br/>
Theoni Pappas is always interesting and has some other really great  <br/>
books out there, too, including the Math Calendar for Kids. Cool.<br/>
<br/>
For a kid who likes biographies, there are two volumes of  <br/>
&quot;Mathematicians are People, too,&quot; which are great!<br/>
<br/>
There are some really wonderful picture books that are math-related.  <br/>
I just mixed these in with all the other picture books we read and  <br/>
read and read - and some because my young children&#39;s favorites.<br/>
<br/>
The arithmetic that is normally learned from Kindergarten through 6th  <br/>
or 7th grade is USEFUL - it&#39;ll come up in real life because it IS  <br/>
useful. So just sort of be aware of that and be a little bit on the  <br/>
lookout for when it comes up. Again, if parents didn&#39;t have so many  <br/>
hang-ups about math, you wouldn&#39;t have to think about it at all, it  <br/>
would just &quot;happen&quot; that kids would learn - but if parents are into  <br/>
avoidance, then the kids may be somewhat deprived of mathematical  <br/>
experience from which to construct their own knowledge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867473997">Also, on getting math basics for a particular career track one can usually take basic math classes at community colleges or start using a textbook at that time if that&#39;s where the interest is. Tutors are another option, which I bet you could find rather inexpensively from a local college, maybe even trading services if you don&#39;t have money to pay them. Even though I studied math through trig/analytical geometery in grammar school when I finally decided to go to college I had to redo the math classes starting at Algebra. Another example of how things work in the &quot;real&quot; world. My oldest son, who is almost 17, never did well in math in school. He had a really hard time with percentages and fractions and decimals and never really got any further than that in school. Now that he is facing real world applications of those things he&#39;s able to figure them out in his head. <br/>
