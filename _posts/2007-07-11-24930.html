<div id="ygrps-yiv-316486007">Thanks, Meredith for your reply. I appreciate your feedback/thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorting things out.......right now gathering a lot of info<br/>
and thinking about things.  <br/>
<br/>
I no longer really give myself permission to do what I&#39;ve mainly<br/>
been doing to relax.......which was, have a few  beers and<br/>
watch movies.  Others around me have moral objections to the<br/>
alchohol (and movies).  I&#39;ve been putting a guilt trip on myself.<br/>
I&#39;ve added exercise and other activities.  <br/>
<br/>
I simply am not as active as some people, partly due to conditions<br/>
and partly to age......and so when my son is around me, we<br/>
tend to not run around as much as most people I know.<br/>
<br/>
But then, most people I know also do not spend very much time<br/>
with their children as people......some don&#39;t ask what their<br/>
child wants to do, anyway....(that depends).......and many people<br/>
I know place a much higher priority (maybe how they&#39;ve grown<br/>
up, maybe just a knee jerk reaction, whatever...) on having a<br/>
super clean home than on spending much time with their children.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised to see parents who just expect their children<br/>
to jump at their every command (almost at a whim) and others<br/>
who just let their children play and never interact with them....<br/>
<br/>
OK, I&#39;m not really saying right or wrong here, but just because<br/>
I&#39;m in a minority doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m wrong either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to take him to some activities......my preference,<br/>
when he was younger, was to go to places.....we went to<br/>
playgrounds, parks, bookstores, etc and tried some sports<br/>
teams, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
We do a lot of play dates, and I have his friends over a LOT.<br/>
<br/>
We go to the public libraries a lot.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right, right now he is still &quot;unwinding&quot; from school.<br/>
<br/>
As much as I DO want to consider his happiness and needs, and I<br/>
am willing to re think how I think, too......I also have to<br/>
think about my limitations and even needs because no one else<br/>
will.....<br/>
<br/>
What I see here is that I have a lot of guilt underlying my<br/>
motives and making me unhappy, so I think it will help to<br/>
put some of that aside, as well as others&#39; expectations, and<br/>
just think calmly about what is best for my son, and also,<br/>
what is best for me.......<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not at a place where I can just only think about what my<br/>
son needs, and &quot;forget about&quot; how I feel, or my limits......that<br/>
won&#39;t work very long with me, and it backfires.  There may be<br/>
some moms/parents who actually can do that.  <br/>
<br/>
I find there is a difference between where I ought to be, where<br/>
I&#39;d like to be, and where I&#39;m actually at in the persent. It<br/>
is a process.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; in the summer he will go with me at times to a lake.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ray&#39;s been out of school for almost 9 months now (!) and while his <br/>
&gt; interests have started to expand beyond computer games he still <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t like to go anywhere that could be seen as a &quot;field trip&quot;. <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s awkward for me, since it leaves me sort of floundering for <br/>
&gt; (cheap to free) ideas, but we, as a family, have found some other <br/>
&gt; ways for him to have outings that he enjoys. Solutions of this kind <br/>
&gt; are going to be unique to families, to some extent, but its worth <br/>
&gt; considering what kinds of resources you may be able to call on, <br/>
&gt; including human resources. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think most of the pressure I feel is self generated....he<br/>
&gt; &gt; is pretty happy left alone alot and likes to do video games<br/>
&gt; &gt; but I try to interest him in other things to get some balance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Balance isn&#39;t necessarily something he needs. That may be a <br/>
&gt; surprising statement, but this idea of &quot;the well rounded child&quot; is <br/>
&gt; just an idea. It doesn&#39;t necessarily have anything to do with the <br/>
&gt; real needs of real individual kids. If he *needed* to be doing a <br/>
&gt; dozen different things, he&#39;d be asking for that in some way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Its really hard to say how things would look if he wasn&#39;t in school <br/>
&gt; because there&#39;s so much of his thinking and behavior tied up in <br/>

&gt; &gt; don&#39;t like to do the same things (which isn&#39;t wrong or that<br/>

my son when I&#39;m focusing too much on *my* stuff (baggage, guilt, needs, etc)<br/>
and not nearly enough on *our* present moment right here. When my<br/>
perspective shifts to us and finding a way to meet OUR needs, it clicks. My<br/>
needs, when intense, are generally well received, as I have received his<br/>
intense needs when necessary.<br/>

That is totally what I find with a really large family. We make <br/>
decisions together based on win win nine times over. Everyone here is <br/>
for us. Does that mean what each of us get our perfect senario every <br/>
time.. NA but close, and that makes it perfect knowing that everyone <br/>
is getting what they need.<br/>

<br/>
I love this Meredith.<br/>
<br/>
I get frustrated with the idea that everyone&#39;s needs can be met all<br/>
the time, because it just doesn&#39;t work that way in a large family.<br/>
Just this morning, both Jalen and Sierra needed my full attention at<br/>
the same time. I couldn&#39;t possibly meet the need right in that moment,<br/>
but I let Jalen know that Sierra was in the middle of telling me<br/>
something very important to her and I would be right over.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to give him my full attention shortly thereafter. But he<br/>
really didn&#39;t want to wait. Neither of them wanted to wait. I can&#39;t<br/>
hear two people talking at me at the same time...just doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
SO, rather than worry about meeting the need right in that moment, I<br/>
CAN let them know that I care and their needs matter. That was an easy<br/>
situation! <br/>
<br/>
I agree that making the need important and creatively seeking mutally<br/>
agreeable solutions works. I also have no guilt when a need can&#39;t be<br/>
met in the moment, because that&#39;s part of coming up against real life<br/>
challenges. The thing that matters most to me, is that everyone  feels<br/>
heard, valued and needed. They know we will all work together to find<br/>
solutions.<br/>

decided not to send it to the list as it was veering off into personal<br/>
topics.....so I thought I had saved it to my email for later<br/>
consideration, but I had sent it to the list, without realizing it.<br/>
<br/>
  I honestly DO try to do win/win situations.....I am finding<br/>
it difficult (not anyone&#39;s &quot;fault&quot;) that it ends up that I<br/>
don&#39;t do things I need to do for myself because I don&#39;t want to<br/>
leave my son alone at home......also I don&#39;t think hours of<br/>
video games nonstop is healthy  for him.......he probably would<br/>
get over that in time........??<br/>
<br/>
   I may need to start out with some structure/boundaries and<br/>
consistently enforce that, but, try to be aware/attentive of<br/>
everyone&#39;s needs as much as possible.  <br/>
<br/>
   When I try to just let it go, there are times it works out<br/>
but other times I just can&#39;t handle it in my present state.<br/>
<br/>
   I was just listening to a tv show from my particular belief<br/>
system......the guests said they had a passive child and a<br/>
&quot;strong willed&quot; child, and the passive one would go along fine<br/>
until he did something weird, then they said, he just needed<br/>
a spanking and he was fine. They said &quot;he needed to know he<br/>
was loved&quot;<br/>
<br/>
     I thought that was weird.   You need to be spanked to know<br/>
you are loved???????????  I can understand needing some help<br/>
with boundaries, and &quot;discipline&quot; (I don&#39;t like that word).....<br/>
why does it have to be spanking?<br/>
<br/>
     OK, I know that people on this list are not going to agree<br/>
either with spanking.<br/>
<br/>
     I have the heart of an unschooler but I have to admit I just<br/>
have some limitations.   I tried to do attachment parenting for<br/>
the most part when he was young.....<br/>
<br/>
      Thanks for all the responses.  I&#39;m learning and growing!<br/>
I appreciate everyone here, and I think it helps to learn to<br/>
think differently.......I feel like my heart is with unschooling<br/>
but I&#39;m not quite all there yet.....<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is so wonderfully put. I read posts all the time that talk about<br/>
&gt; finding a win/win situation for everyone. I wonder with two kids of<br/>
&gt; my own how that can possibly be done. Obviously, if both want two<br/>

&gt; clear that I feel silly for not thinking of it this way sooner.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love what Meredith wrote and think it&#39;s an important piece of the <br/>
puzzle, but I feel sad when I hear someone thinking that win/ win <br/>
solutions aren&#39;t possible and find myself wanting to take the time to <br/>
try to articulate how the process works in our family. I have three <br/>
kiddos very close in age (9, 8 and 7), and I remember feeling early on <br/>
that same sense of disbelief and certainty that folks living win/wins <br/>
successfully must not have multiple children.<br/>
<br/>
----&quot;Obviously, if both want two different things somebody isn&#39;t <br/>
wining.&quot;----<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s the part that prompted me to jump in.<br/>
<br/>
Win/ win problem solving, or problem solving for common preference *is* <br/>
about making sure that everyone feels valued every time. Everyone&#39;s <br/>
needs in every moment are important enough to be listened to, <br/>
considered, and brainstormed about meeting. During this *process* itself <br/>
of voicing, listening, considering, brainstorming what often happens is <br/>
that the two (or three or four...) needs that were *seemingly* in <br/>
conflict in the beginning, come round to actually not being so directly <br/>
conflicting, or they give way to an alternate option that is genuinely <br/>
preferable but just wasn&#39;t visible as long as the first two options <br/>
remained in opposition.<br/>
<br/>
The *process* itself of working towards the win/win solution is, in my <br/>
experience, the important thing and where both the valuing and the <br/>
cooperation happen. By engaging in the process itself, people become <br/>
successful problem-solvers. By engaging in the process, &quot;winning&quot; is no <br/>
longer the goal.<br/>
<br/>
A practical example off the top of my head...<br/>
<br/>
My two girls share a bedroom, and while most of the time it works great, <br/>
there are moments where it generates conflict because they are needing <br/>
very different things in the same space. I can recall one time where Em <br/>
was needing quiet, private space in her room while Jules was needing a <br/>
place to build with her Polly Pockets (or maybe Bratz?). They couldn&#39;t <br/>
agree and came to me for help finding a solution. I listened to both <br/>
perspectives, asked some questions to expand upon what they were wanting <br/>
to do and understand more of the details. We then talked about Em maybe <br/>
taking private space in my room, but that didn&#39;t seem preferable to her. <br/>
What about Jules playing in a different space, but no, not preferable <br/>
either--the conflict really was about the space in that moment and who <br/>
would get it. What about Em taking some private time in a nice tub with <br/>
lavender bubbles and some candles? Yep, that worked with the vision of <br/>
private space that Em was looking for, so she agreed to this solution, <br/>
giving Jules the use of the bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
But...the moment Em agreed that the tub was, indeed, a preferable <br/>
solution, the conflict itself melted away and instead of either of them <br/>
wanting to use the bedroom, they decided that what they both really <br/>
wanted to do was to play Bratz (or Pollys) in the tub together without <br/>
candles and off they went.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;ve found over and over again in moments like these is that <br/>
conflict really does give way to common preference or win/ win just by <br/>
engaging in the *process* itself.<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are times the process is clumsy and frustrating and <br/>
maybe feels like there will never be a solution. And there are times, as <br/>
well, where stop-gap solutions have been made because of practical <br/>
time-constraints, but we always come back to the issue and problem solve <br/>
successfully for a next time. I&#39;m not saying the process is always <br/>
perfect. But, we have found over the years that the more we do it, the <br/>
more often it works, the more it becomes second-nature, and the more <br/>
people *trust* that their needs will, indeed, be met. It&#39;s that trust, I <br/>
think, that opens people up to considering alternative solutions. When <br/>
folks don&#39;t trust that their needs will be met, then they dig in their <br/>
heals and fight to hold onto their little piece of the pie. The more <br/>
experiences people have of their needs being valued and honored and met, <br/>
the more willing they are to agree that meeting the need at 2:00 will <br/>
work just as well as meeting the need at 1:30 because they can trust <br/>
that it *will* be met even if it&#39;s deferred for a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
That temporal thing hangs people up a lot when considering the idea of <br/>
win/ win problem solving--how can someone meet multiple needs *in the <br/>
same moment*?<br/>
<br/>
Well, yeah, of course there will be solutions that aren&#39;t *in the same <br/>
moment* because none of us (as far as I know *g*) has figured out how to <br/>
be in multiple places at one time. But the process and the trust in the <br/>
outcome are what, in my experience, have made the *in the same moment* <br/>
issue really a non-factor most of the time. Well, that, and <br/>
maturity--just the developmental ability to wait--has been hugely <br/>
important as well. My kids understand that sometimes win/ win solutions <br/>
are consecutive rather than simultaneous and that factors into our <br/>
solutions.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess this was all a long-winded way of saying that <br/>
problem-solving for win/ wins *is* possible and really does become <br/>
easier with patience and practice and trust.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780208104">Bravo, Danielle!<br/>
<br/>
To put a little different spin on it...<br/>
<br/>
My skill right now at facilitating win/win situations is not as good as it<br/>
will be in six months.  I&#39;m getting better.  So even though I may not be<br/>
able to get to a win/win in a lot of situations, I&#39;m getting better at it.<br/>
I keep striving for that goal, and I keep getting closer and closer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I agree it&#39;s really helpful to see living by win/ win or common <br/>
preference as an ideal we&#39;re working towards in each moment. Viewing it <br/>
that way helps us be more forgiving of ourselves and others in those <br/>
moments where it doesn&#39;t come easily so we can move forward and do <br/>
better next time.<br/>
<br/>
With one caveat: that we&#39;re always mindfully striving towards that ideal <br/>
and not using that viewpoint as an excuse to continue to fall short.<br/>

win/win, in the *knowing* in my heart that it is possible to meet the needs<br/>
presented to me (no, it&#39;s really never like what any of us have in hour<br/>
thoughts at the beginning). I have to hold myself in the esteem of really<br/>
and truly being able to handle whatever comes my way -- i.e. two kids going<br/>
two different directions at the exact same time, needing me only me right<br/>
now! -- because only *that* diana/mommy can do it. First I breathe, then I<br/>
remind myself of my capability and that the answer exists. I ask the kid(s)<br/>
for input. I remind them of my goal to take care of the needs of the team.<br/>
It&#39;s not 100% and probably never will be; still human. Because I strive to<br/>
give what I got, there&#39;s a lot of faith in me and an overall sense of<br/>
win/win/win in our lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215793825">My Ideal:<br/>
Step 1:  Continually (and almost arrogantly) believe that I can achieve<br/>

Step 2:  If and when it doesn&#39;t work, figure out why.  Return to Step 1.<br/>
