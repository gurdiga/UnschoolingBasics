<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334706620">Next week we&#39;re heading to Denver CO. We&#39;ll be in<br/>
Denver tuesday thru sunday and then going to Boulder<br/>
and up into the mountains. We would love to go to a<br/>
park day while there or meet other unschoolers. I have<br/>
2 kids - 8 year old girl and 5 yr old boy.<br/>
<br/>
I searched on the web and found several homeschooling<br/>
organizations and one even with a park day, but the<br/>
web-site was set up such that you had to become a<br/>
member and pay your dues before you could get<br/>
information about the park day.<br/>
<br/>
So if you&#39;d like to meet us or have helpful<br/>
information about park day, what to see in Denver etc,<br/>
contact me off-list at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:m_kher@...">m_kher@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Manisha<br/>
