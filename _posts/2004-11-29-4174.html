<br/>
ACK!! No, no, no, no!! Please don&#39;t support that agency, they&#39;ve <br/>
done more to harm homeschoolers than help. It&#39;s a very conservative <br/>
Christian organization and they aren&#39;t real keen on helping <br/>
unschoolers, though they have in some cases.<br/>
<br/>
Please read more about them here:<br/>

<br/>
EDUCATE yourself on the state laws where you live!! Knowledge is <br/>
power. If you know what the law says, that is the best way to <br/>
prevent problems. Don&#39;t live in fear, family can make phone calls <br/>
but homeschooling is LEGAL. Make sure you know the laws of your <br/>
state...PLEASE.<br/>
<br/>
And if you need help with that, NHEN is a wonderful resource!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Stacie -- I think you&#39;re new to the list and you posted saying you are <br/>
&quot;schooling&quot; and getting stressed out from it. I assume that is why <br/>
you&#39;re here, to learn about unschooling, not to promote HSLDA? I&#39;m also <br/>
assuming you didn&#39;t realize that HSLDA&#39;s politics are not appreciated <br/>
by many homeschoolers and that it is not appropriate to promote them on <br/>
inclusive homeschooling lists. If you don&#39;t understand why people are <br/>
reacting to it the way they are, I suggest you do some reading on your <br/>
own to try to understand their response.<br/>
<br/>
If you have homeschooling problems, there are open inclusive <br/>
organizations in Maine to help you out:<br/>
