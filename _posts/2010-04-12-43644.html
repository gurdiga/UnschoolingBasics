<div id="ygrps-yiv-624310412">The last few days have been filled with wonderful little moments.<br/>
<br/>
I realized, when Draven offered to pump the gas for me, that he does quite a<br/>
lot of helpful things without being asked . . . all of those things I&#39;ve<br/>
never forced him to do.  He offers to cook meals when my sleep schedule is<br/>
all wacky from overnight shifts, he offers to swipe the debit card, he<br/>
offers to pay for and pump the gas.  He used to offer to clean quite often,<br/>
until I started making it his &quot;job&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned before that we have an 18 y/o staying with us.  She is wonderful<br/>
about jumping in to help when we&#39;re doing something, but hasn&#39;t taken<br/>
the initiative to start any cleaning on her own.  At her moms house it<br/>
sounds like she was the unpaid maid, so while on one hand I completely<br/>
understand her lack of interest in washing dishes, but on the other hand I<br/>
was very frustrated that neither she or Draven had been doing much around<br/>
the house while Parker and I were working.  Yesterday early morning when I<br/>
got home from work I did a ton of dishes, washed them all and stacked them<br/>
to dry on towels covering most of our counter space and the top of the<br/>
stove.  I started to leave a list for them to take care of during the day<br/>
(taking the trash out, putting away the dishes) while I was sleeping, but<br/>
then decided I was setting myself up to be even more frustrated if the<br/>
didn&#39;t see or didn&#39;t do what was on the list, so in place of a list I wrote<br/>
&quot;I love our little family&quot;.   Last night before I went to work Parker<br/>
started gathering the trash and asked if anyone would be willing to help,<br/>
both Dollie and Draven cheerfully said they would, and the three of them got<br/>
all of the trash out and down to the curb.  An hour or so later I was on the<br/>
phone with Parker and she said she heard them putting the dishes away while<br/>
laughing and joking, she hadn&#39;t asked them to.  This morning I came home to<br/>
see all of last nights dishes had been washed and set out to dry.<br/>
 No disappointment, no frustration, no bickering, just a family making sure<br/>
everything gets done.<br/>
<br/>
When I got home this morning on my desk was my son&#39;s DSI, with a post it<br/>
note asking me to listen to some of the sound files and signed I &lt;heart&gt;<br/>
you.  Spread out over 4 sound files was a wonderful little song he sang<br/>
about our family (including his father).  I liked finding that so much more<br/>
then I would have liked finding a list of things to do.  I&#39;m glad I left a<br/>
loving note instead of a list before I went to bed.<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago Parker and I were cuddling with Draven and it turned into us<br/>
tickling him, he started fighting back violently, which was normally the<br/>
time that I&#39;d stop tickling, even though for awhile now we&#39;ve had stop as<br/>
our boundary word when he really does want something to stop.  This time<br/>
instead of assuming we needed to stop because it was getting violent, I<br/>
asked him if he wanted to stop, he didn&#39;t, so I asked Parker if she was okay<br/>
with him fighting back like that (she was at his feet and he was kicking<br/>
quite hard), we were all fine with it.  So, we continued tickling and he<br/>
continued &quot;trying&quot; to kick and punch at us over it, and we held his feet and<br/>
blocked his punches the whole while laughing and giggling and barely being<br/>
able to catch our breath.  He occasionally said stop so he could catch his<br/>
breath, and eventually started adding rules (you can tickle me here, but not<br/>
here) and even later explained that he couldn&#39;t really control his kicking<br/>
when we tickled in certain spots and he didn&#39;t want to hurt one of us.  It<br/>
sounds pretty violent when I type it out, but it wasn&#39;t a negative thing at<br/>
all.  After we finished he went back to playing one of his games and I<br/>
noticed he got a lot less frustrated when he had a hard time.  Ah-ha!  He<br/>
needed the rough play to get some frustration out.  Over the last few days<br/>
he&#39;s been less frustrated in general.  You know, he didn&#39;t have frustration<br/>
and anger problems when he was younger and we used to mock fight on a fairly<br/>
regular basis . . . wish I would have put those two together a lot earlier.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also noticing my view of things changing.  Not just at home, but at work<br/>
as well.  I&#39;m doing a much better job of accepting EVERYONE for who they<br/>
are, and not expecting them to be who I want them to be.  I&#39;m appreciating<br/>
the job my coworkers do instead of getting frustrated that they didn&#39;t do<br/>
what I expected or wanted them to do.<br/>
<br/>
Parker is getting a lot more on board with this too.  A few days ago Draven<br/>
asked if he could play Grand Theft Auto, something I&#39;ve NEVER let him play<br/>
before, and it&#39;s only in the house because Parker used to play it.  I had<br/>
already said yes to Devil May cry, and stopped restricting how long he could<br/>
play Halo . . . but Grand Theft Auto . . . I completely freaked (internally,<br/>
externally my response was &quot;let me think about it, and I think I need to<br/>
talk to Parker about it too&quot;.  So I called her, and I asked her, and she<br/>
said we should say yes, and that if I thought I could do it without<br/>
freaking, I should probably sit with him and see what he likes about the<br/>
game and what he does with it.  It is a pretty violent game, but I think he<br/>
had more fun playing with the cheats (invisible cars and flying cars seem to<br/>
be a favorite) then he had beating people up.  I think it&#39;ll be okay.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a good week!  We&#39;ve had a few bad moments, but lots of good ones,<br/>
and we&#39;re all getting better at this whole concept, day by day.<br/>
