<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981941478"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And by the time a kid is a teenager, he or she is essentially beyond most parental authority most of the time if the kid has any independence <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>at all (like if they sneak what they want outside the home or in their <br/>
room), so obviously giving in gracefully to a child&#39;s plans or wishes by <br/>
then makes a lot of sense no matter what kind of parenting style one had. <br/>
What is hard is to decide what to do in the time in between birth and <br/>
becoming a teenager.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
**********************<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;sneaking&quot; COMES with the lack of partnership between the parent and child. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re setting yourself up to have a child who feels the need to sneak and lie when <br/>
you don&#39;t groom that relationship *EARLY*.<br/>
<br/>
If a child *always* has &quot;independence&quot;---and I like Meredith&#39;s take<br/>
better: when a child always has *autonomy*, the child won&#39;t feel the<br/>
need to sneak around or lie to you. When he knows that you accept that he has automony, <br/>
he doesn&#39;t have that *need* to &quot;prove&quot; that he&#39;s autonomous.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Giving in gracefully&quot; to my child would NEVER enter my mind---either<br/>
when he&#39;s a child or a teenager---OR an adult. That&#39;s not how our<br/>
relationship works. I want to work to help him get what he needs---his<br/>
entire LIFE. It may be messy. It may be tough. But I want him as<br/>
comfortable in his own skin and in his own home as possible.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not all that hard to decide to treat a child as always doing his<br/>
best. It may be hard to DO that sometimes, but the decision to<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be all that hard! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***************************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In my family, freedom for *everyone* is important (parents, child, and even<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the dogs and pet chickens) but I accept that sometimes these freedoms and<br/>
desires conflict (whether when the parents freely want to use their energy<br/>
to have the child behave in a different way or vice versa&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
************************<br/>
<br/>
Why would the goal be to get someone else to act a certain way? You can&#39;t control others.<br/>
<br/>
I put all my energy into getting myself to act a certain way. That&#39;s<br/>
hard enough in itself! When I use all my energy on ME, I don&#39;t have<br/>
anything left to spend changing others. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What I *do* have left, I tend to spend on the dog. &lt;g&gt; But he seems happy enough.<br/>
<br/>
*****************************<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Perhaps seeking balance is just not unschooling in any way? Can&#39;t quality<br/>
 </span></blockquote>compassionate childhood education be a balance of the interests of the<br/>
parent and the interests of the child? Can one even imagine a happy family<br/>
where the interests of both parent and child are not respected to some<br/>
degree in some sort of balance?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
********************************<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re very short-sighted when looking at balance. You want ALL balance NOW.<br/>
<br/>
I see it as a life-long pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
A tiny infant cannot hold up *his* end of the teeter-totter. But over<br/>
time, with a LOT of help work on *my* part (I take the lion&#39;s share of<br/>
that effort), he can eventually balance on his own. <br/>
<br/>
A child whose parents do it all for him and who do not let him<br/>
experiment on his own may never get the &quot;feel&quot; of the teeter-totter. He<br/>
may always need help navigating the thing. <br/>
<br/>
A child whose parents do *nothing* to help him *may* figure it out---but at <br/>
what cost? He may fall and break his neck.<br/>
<br/>
What a child NEEDS is a parent who will hold him until he feels the<br/>
urge to play more independently. And venture out on his own s-l-o-w-l-y<br/>
(or quickly! &lt;g&gt;) until he understands how the teeter-totter<br/>
works. To get the feel of the machine. A parent who could suggest a big<br/>
rock or three in the pockets might change the dynamics. Or who will let<br/>
the child scooch up or back further to experiment. Maybe put a second<br/>
child on one side to counter the weight. A parent who won&#39;t balk at<br/>
using the machine in a way that the &quot;authorities&quot; insist you<br/>
don&#39;t---like standing at the fulcrum and balancing that way.<br/>
<br/>
The lifelong balance *I* am writing about is the WHOLE life of the<br/>
parent-child relationship. When I&#39;m old and feeble, I may want my<br/>
children to take me to that same teeter-totter and let me balance. I&#39;ll<br/>
probably need help. Hopefully, they won&#39;t say, &quot;You&#39;re old enough to<br/>
know how to do that all by yourself!&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yin-yang: I trust my children; they trust me. I respect my children;<br/>
they respect me. I&#39;m kind to my children; they&#39;re kind to me. I&#39;m<br/>
generous to my children; they&#39;re generous with me. I&#39;m patient with my<br/>
children; they&#39;re patient with me. I accept my children for Who They<br/>
Are; they accept me for Who I Am.<br/>
<br/>
As the older, more experienced partner, I choose to take the first steps. I could <br/>
try to force them; but that dosn&#39;t seem to work for *me*, so why would I expect <br/>
my children to buy it? Plus---on the *balance* end of it: if I force THEM (in any way),<br/>
what would be their natural response? Balance-wise? To push back? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I honestly can&#39;t think of a better-balanced relationship. I just don&#39;t need all <br/>
the balance at once. I look at the WHOLE picture.<br/>
