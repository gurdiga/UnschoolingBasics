My struggle is not with getting it, I get it. It is with applying it.<br/>

Well, you&#39;re already halfway there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Specifics? Maybe we can help.<br/>
<br/>
========<br/>
It is so in my face right now...<br/>
I would like to live consensually with my kids. I have been trying to<br/>
talk with then and come to agreeable solutions. Sometimes they (ok<br/>
mostly the 5y/o) will refuse to talk or even listen. I don&#39;t know what<br/>
to do. I learned to parent from Dr. Sears books. 2 years ago I learned<br/>
about radical unschooling and the philosophy lit up my heart. This is<br/>
the way my partner and I wanted to parent. So we are struggling to<br/>
give up our coercive ways and be more in partnership with our kids.<br/>
W.e worked through US&#39;ing television, food, etc. I am still struggling<br/>
with chores, we don&#39;t have any for the kids but I still get bent about<br/>
it occaisionally. My biggest road block is safety and disrespect. I do<br/>
sometimes resort to punishment when I can&#39;t figure things out. But<br/>
because I know there is a kinder way I feel horrible doing that.<br/>
example:<br/>
Today at Target we went to buy outdoor toys. I am the house in town<br/>
that all the kids congregate so we needed to get more supplies like<br/>
chalk, bubbles, etc. We made a list. When we get there they keep<br/>
asking me for stuff. I explain the limited funds. Remind that that<br/>
next weekend we will be going away, etc. Still my ds5 pitches a few<br/>
fits. I work through them, his sister even works thru one with him. He<br/>
screams that he does care about xyz he wants what he wants and he<br/>
wants it now! I feel like I am livinf with a tyrant who will not<br/>
accept a no. I feel really frustrated. I can&#39;t handle these frequent<br/>
melt downs emotionally. I get anxiety, I am not sure if having anxiety<br/>
is incompatible with RU. Also we got large play balls. The kids kept<br/>
bouncing them and stuff. But the store was not crowded but had a few<br/>
people. I asked them to put them in the car or hold on to them. I<br/>
explained that there were too many people to bounce balls and that it<br/>
would be disrespectful to do so.  ds5 kept doig it. I know he just<br/>
forgot but when I reminded him he got really verbally abusive. I did<br/>
after severaln reminders tell him that if the ball left his hands<br/>
again i would put it away. I felt like that was a threat of punishment<br/>
but I didn&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>
<br/>
I also sent him to his room because I needed space from his almost<br/>
constant verbal abuse today. He just woke up in a crappy mood and<br/>
takes it out on me and whoever is around.This is frequent. Nothing<br/>
helps him to feel better. ok, at least nothing I have been able to<br/>
figure out. He is so full of anger and wants to hurt people.<br/>

<br/>
This may or may not apply to you.  If it doesn&#39;t then maybe someone<br/>
else can use the info.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m about 33 weeks pregnant now.  (Getting there) and I only recently<br/>
(maybe a week or two ago) started fixing the damage I feel I have done<br/>
during the course of this pregnancy.  I ended up getting one night<br/>
away with my husband (anniversary) and (instead of enjoying his<br/>
company - sorry) I did nothing but think about how I and we could fix<br/>
what was happening.  It was just eating at me.  We were experiencing a<br/>
lot of the same things you described, only mine is 9!  <br/>
<br/>
What I did, was really look deep to see how I had changed when I got<br/>
pregnant.  I had become something of a hormonal mess.  Or so i felt<br/>
like one anyway.  I was snappy and rude, short tempered, tired a lot<br/>
more, emotionally unavailable, and less sensitive to their needs.  It<br/>
was really hard to make the change, but i had to stop thinking about<br/>
me and really focus on THEM.  I still feel that being pregnant takes<br/>
so much out of their precious lives, but I suppose its a learning<br/>
experience for all of us. <br/>
<br/>
I sort of used the &quot;kill em with kindness&quot; thing.  I just practiced<br/>
being as patient and as kind as humanly possible.  Until it became<br/>
natural again.  I made some special days for the older child (who seem<br/>
to be suffering more).  We&#39;re painting his room, and I&#39;m really<br/>
focussing on paying more attention to him and his needs.  We brought<br/>
some more toys into the common area and I am playing with him more.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...  in a nutshell.  In order to figure out why my kids were<br/>
suddenly acting like they were before unschooling, I had to look at my<br/>
own behavior and fix it.  Fast!   <br/>

<br/>
Your son sounds like my son(6)!  But I think we had a break through today at<br/>
the grocery store.  He wanted to get a magazine (which I let him have).  But<br/>
at the checkout, he changed his mind and asked for a Rockies baseball<br/>
toy--many of which were on display at the end of the checkout counter.  I<br/>
told him that it depended on which one.  (Some were more expensive than<br/>
others.)  He couldn&#39;t decide and it ended up that I was finished checking<br/>
out before he could decide, so we left without one.  Of course he threw a<br/>
fit.  But I&#39;ve been trying to be more understanding, and I could definitely<br/>
see his point of view on this, so I think that helped me stay calm.<br/>
<br/>
Normally I would have forced him into the car or a quiet corner of the store<br/>
where we could talk, and no one would be staring at us.  But I felt more<br/>
confident this time, for some reason, and didn&#39;t care who was staring.  We<br/>
calmly talked (with several not so calm shouts from him) about why he<br/>
couldn&#39;t have the toy.  He didn&#39;t care, but I was willing to stay and<br/>
continue talking as long as it took.  I tried to stay very calm and loving.<br/>
Then he started pulling all the toys off the rack and throwing them on the<br/>
floor.  I did physically have to stop him on this, and I carried him into<br/>
the cart.  I told him those weren&#39;t our toys, and I couldn&#39;t let him be<br/>
disrespectful.  In the past this kind of behavior has escalated into full on<br/>
yelling and screaming and kicking on his part, especially if I have to<br/>
physically control him.  But he seemed okay with me putting him in the<br/>
cart.<br/>
<br/>
Out in the parking lot, he refused to get out of the cart and into the car.<br/>
He started crying about how his life sucked and nothing ever goes right.<br/>
(His usual response in situations like these.  But normally it goes on for<br/>
at least a half hour.)  Instead of brushing that off or even trying to<br/>
respond to the comment, I just reached over and gave him a hug.  And he let<br/>
me hug him.  Then I tried one more time to get him out of the cart, but he<br/>
still resisted.  I looked at him and said, &quot;What do you need?&quot;  He said,<br/>
&quot;More love from you.&quot;  So we hugged some more.  Then suddenly, he perked up<br/>
and said, &quot;Let&#39;s go to the park.&quot;  He hopped out of the cart and into the<br/>
car, and off we went.  Incident over.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that &quot;all he needs is a hug.&quot;  In fact, I can&#39;t exactly<br/>
pinpoint what I did to change his behavior.  I don&#39;t know if it was my<br/>
unusually calm energy, the actual hug, or the beginning of a change in our<br/>
relationship since we&#39;ve been moving towards &quot;no punishment.&quot;  Maybe someone<br/>
here has some insight.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I thought I&#39;d share this story, just to say there is hope.  It may<br/>
be gradual, but you&#39;ll soon start to notice little changes!<br/>

finished checking out, then waited with him while he chose, then we<br/>
would have gone through the line again. I&#39;m sure there are other<br/>
solutions, too.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>==============<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helps me with this sort of stuff is to remember that <br/>
it&#39;s very normal for that age. It&#39;s ok for him to be upset that he <br/>
can&#39;t have everything he wants right this moment. He truly does not <br/>
understand why not.   <br/>
<br/>
Empathizing with your son may help. I talk to my ds about how hard <br/>
it is to wait for things we really want and how much it really <br/>
stinks to not be able to get everything we want right now. I tell <br/>
him about things that I want that I can&#39;t afford right now (and <br/>
probably never will be able to). That won&#39;t necessarily make him <br/>
stop crying and screaming but I hope it lets him know that we all <br/>
feel that way and it&#39;s ok.<br/>
<br/>
=======<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am livinf with a tyrant who will not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; accept a no. I feel really frustrated. I can&#39;t handle these <br/>
 </span></blockquote>frequent<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; melt downs emotionally. I get anxiety, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>=========<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m feeling upset about my child&#39;s behavior in public it is <br/>
always because I&#39;m worried about what other people will think. I&#39;ve <br/>
had to change my thinking and tell myself, if anyone is thinking <br/>
anything about us, they are probably thinking that they know how it <br/>
is (even if that may not be true it makes me feel better).<br/>
<br/>
=======<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am not sure if having anxiety<br/>
&gt; is incompatible with RU. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>========<br/>
<br/>
Anxiety is normal. Any feeling is normal. It&#39;s what you do with <br/>
those feelings that makes the difference.<br/>
<br/>
========<br/>
<br/>
Also we got large play balls. The kids kept<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; bouncing them and stuff. But the store was not crowded but had a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>few<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; people. I asked them to put them in the car or hold on to them. I<br/>

 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; would be disrespectful to do so.  ds5 kept doig it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>==========<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how bouncing balls in the store is disrespectful. I can <br/>
see how it might be dangerous. A ball could hit a person, even a <br/>
small child, who could get hurt or it could hit some other things in <br/>
the store and break them. Maybe your ds would&#39;ve responded better to <br/>
that reasoning.<br/>
<br/>
=======<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also sent him to his room because I needed space from his almost<br/>
&gt; constant verbal abuse today. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>=========<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s prefectly ok for you to take a time out if you are <br/>
feeling very angry, upset, overwhelmed. There are ways to do it <br/>
without it being a punishment for your child. Sometimes I tell my ds <br/>
that I&#39;m feeling very whatever and need a moment to myself and would <br/>
like to go in my room alone for a little bit. I couldn&#39;t do that <br/>
when he was 3 but now that he&#39;s 4 he&#39;s getting better with this <br/>
concept.<br/>
<br/>
=========== <br/>
<br/>
He just woke up in a crappy mood and<br/>

&gt; helps him to feel better. ok, at least nothing I have been able to<br/>
&gt; figure out. He is so full of anger and wants to hurt people.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>===========<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried just being present for him? Let him get out all his <br/>
angry feelings in a safe place with you just there not passing <br/>
judgement, not reacting at all. Let him lead. Hold him if he wants <br/>
to be held. Sit on the other side of the room if he wants to rant <br/>
and rave and not be touched. <br/>

<br/>
When I was a young teen, I was at a check-out with my dad. A child in <br/>
front of us was &quot;throwing a tantrum.&quot; My dad told me that the child <br/>
probably just needed a hug.<br/>
<br/>
That stuck with me all my life.<br/>
<br/>
I always remembered it with my own boys---that they needed my <br/>
*attention*. When I joined these lists and read what the posters wrote <br/>
about how to deal with these &quot;tantrums,&quot; it made all the sense in the <br/>
world---just like my dad&#39;s statement. Just not to ignore my child and <br/>
to be attentive and caring and understanding. It seems so simple---and <br/>
it is. Children are often hungry or tired or don&#39;t *want* to be there. <br/>
And it&#39;s *hard* to be in a store and not GET something---especially <br/>
when the person with you is *getting* so much!<br/>
<br/>
Just a little love and understanding can go sooo far!<br/>
