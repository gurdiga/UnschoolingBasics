<div id="ygrps-yiv-728556962">I really need some help here. I am at a total loss as to what to do.<br/>
<br/>
For the last few weeks my ds (10) has been asking questions about sex. We<br/>
have had some really good conversations about it. He is very embarrassed<br/>
about anything having to do with sex so I was very happy that he was able to<br/>
even ask. I answered all of his questions as honestly as I could. He told me<br/>
after each conversation that he was so grateful that he had a mother who was<br/>
not embarrassed to talk about sex and everything was so great. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday he had a couple of questions for me and, again, I answered them<br/>
the best I could. Somehow the conversation took a turn and he started to get<br/>
upset. He started asking personal questions about me and his dad&#39;s sex life.<br/>
He said that he didn&#39;t want me and his dad having sex anymore. When I asked<br/>
him why he said because it embarrassed him. He became very upset and was<br/>
crying and very angry. He went to his room and took a long nap. I thought<br/>
maybe he had just been tired and he would feel better when he woke up. He<br/>
did for a few minutes after he woke up. He came to me and gave me a hug and<br/>
said he was sorry. We joked a little about his hormones, which we had just<br/>
talked about earlier during the day. (I should mention that dh is out of<br/>
town for a couple of days) Everything seemed fine and we got ready to go get<br/>
some dinner. He asked me a kind of off-handed question as we were leaving<br/>
and then got very irate. He started yelling, calling me a disgusting sicko.<br/>
I tried to talk to him but he said &quot;Just get away from me you sicko!&quot; I was<br/>
very hurt but I decided to leave him alone and let him calm down. He didn&#39;t.<br/>
In the drive-through in the car he asked me how many toothpicks it would<br/>
take to spell out sicko. He wouldn&#39;t talk to me all night. He kept slamming<br/>
things around and walking by my room where I was laying in bed. To be honest<br/>
I was a little afraid to go to sleep last night and considered locking my<br/>
door because he seemed SO angry. I called his dad and told him what was<br/>
going on and dh tried to talk to him. Then when I woke up this morning he<br/>
had posted signs all over the house saying sicko. He sent me about 50 emails<br/>
calling me a disgusting sicko and one saying that he would never speak to me<br/>
again. <br/>
<br/>
Help!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985666660">Wow. (((hugs)))<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry this happened to you. You must be scared, confused and <br/>
hurt. <br/>
Where could he be getting these ideas? Has he been spending time <br/>
with anyone that may have told him these things? Maybe a web site or <br/>
a book? Could there be any way possible he may have been sexually <br/>
molested recently?<br/>
<br/>
I ask because my children came to us through foster care and had <br/>
been sexually molested. When that happens to a child, their view of <br/>
sex can become warped and my middle child acted out in sexually <br/>
inappropriate ways for a long time after we adopted her. <br/>
<br/>
I hope you get to the root of this. (((hugs)))<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656484880">Whew!!  ((((((((Dawn))))))))  This is a tough situation!  It&#39;s hard <br/>
for me to know exactly what to do, since I don&#39;t know you or your son <br/>
or what the actual conversations were that triggered his intense <br/>
reaction.  On the basis of what you&#39;re saying, though, here&#39;s what I might do:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you can actually speak with him, but you could <br/>
communicate.  How would you feel about writing him a note or an email <br/>
to ask for a truce?  I think I would tell him that I can see he&#39;s <br/>
**really** upset with me, and that I want to understand better what <br/>
his issue is and help him work this through so we can heal our <br/>
relationship.  I would tell him that I&#39;m the same person I&#39;ve always <br/>
been and that I love him hugely and am sad to see him in so much <br/>
pain.  I would also ask him if there may be someone else he&#39;d feel <br/>
comfortable with to work this through.  I would be sure to apologize <br/>
for any way I might have hurt or confused him without my knowing <br/>
(but, that&#39;s the way I am).<br/>
<br/>
I think those actions may at least get your toe in the door, but I <br/>
really don&#39;t know.  Please keep us posted about this and let us know <br/>
what happens.  I&#39;ll be thinking of you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149967832">Dawn, do you have a minister/priest/rabbi/iman/pastor/etc who could<br/>
talk to him?  I remember my brother went through a similar thing.  Sex<br/>
was a dirty word to him at that age.  He also told my parents not to<br/>
&quot;do that&quot; anymore.  (I think he still likes to believe in immaculate<br/>
conception to answer his and our sibling&#39;s existance even at 34yo and<br/>
a child of his own.)  We are sexual creatures.  It&#39;s just a part of<br/>
our lives.  I remember my mom had our priest talk to my brother about<br/>
some sexual issues he was going through.  It helped him to know that<br/>
our priest had sex (Episcopal priests can marry) and had a sexual<br/>
life.  It also helped to hear from someone my brother revered that sex<br/>
was natural and a good thing and nothing to be ashamed of.<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen him naked recently?  I ask this because I wonder if<br/>
there are some changes going on in his body that maybe happening<br/>
earlier than with other boys his age.  Maybe his friends are not going<br/>
through those changes as quickly?  Perhaps he said something about the<br/>
presence of hair or enlargement of genetalia or perhaps even an<br/>
erection or sexually vivid dream and was ridiculed or made fun of.  I<br/>
remember that my brother went from being &quot;Mr. Exhibitionist&quot; to<br/>
&quot;Eeeek!  You might see my body&quot; in just a matter of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
This may be a place where mom can step back and let a trusted male do<br/>
some talking.  It may be that anything that you say may make things<br/>
worse.  He may find you just trying to justify yourself.  Perhaps he<br/>
needs to see a male pov about sexual issues.  See things from a &quot;man&#39;s<br/>
perspective&quot; so to speak.  And it could be the whole &quot;mother is<br/>
sacred&quot; thing that he is having problems with.  He may consider you<br/>
&quot;sicko&quot; because his *mother* did &quot;those things&quot; and for some children<br/>
that is a very difficult thing to consider.  To prove that point, I<br/>
was in my late 20&#39;s maybe early 30&#39;s when my mom made some reference<br/>
to her sexualness.  (Had to do with not being able to live with the<br/>
Shakers because they don&#39;t have sex.)  GASP!  My *mom* has sex.  And<br/>
then a year or so ago I was helping my mom clean out my dad&#39;s office<br/>
(again) and came across a sample pack of Viagra!!  Why would my<br/>
*parents* need *that*?  :-D  It&#39;s sometimes difficult for even grown<br/>
children who see themselves as sexual creatures to think of their<br/>
parents as sexual creatures.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle - whose 11yo is convinced that there must be some other way<br/>
for people to get pregnant than having sex!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357884061">I was wondering if some of the things he has seen on TV or just passing<br/>
comments or innuendos may have some effect on his ideas about sex. Maybe<br/>
it&#39;s somehow come across to him as something dirty and twisted. When we were<br/>
talking about sex I tried to put forth that it is a totally natural and<br/>
beautiful thing that 2 people share. I really tried to drive that point<br/>
home. Guess I wasn&#39;t able to get that across. I feel like I am competing<br/>
with all these ideas that come in to our lives from the outside world. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018895760">Hi Dawn,<br/>
   <br/>
  What a difficult situation for you (((((hugs)))))<br/>
   <br/>
  I hope I&#39;m not out of line in suggesting this but dod you think there could be something Oedipal going on ?<br/>
   <br/>
  I was a single mom to my eldest ds until I met someone and started dating when ds was about 5.  Although they got on really well (and still do because I&#39;ve now been married to the guy for 6 yrs !) my son would completely freak out if I went out on dates in the evening.  Turns out he was just very scared of losing the special relationship we had together.<br/>
   <br/>
  I just wonder whether your ds - now being aware of the sexual element to adult relationships- has realised that this is something you share with dh that he can&#39;t share with you ?<br/>
   <br/>
  Add into the mix his new knowledge of what sex is and I could kind of understand where he might be coming from.  Maybe the idea of sex grosses him out a bit (I know it did me when I first thought about it in any depth!) and he&#39;s both grossed out and a little terrified at what this new info means to your relationship ?<br/>
   <br/>
  Just my thoughts - hope they don&#39;t offend :)<br/>

only make it worse, but right now I am basically just letting him treat me<br/>
this way and I know that is not right either. <br/>
<br/>
Dawn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whew!! ((((((((Dawn)))))))) This is a tough situation! It&#39;s hard <br/>
for me to know exactly what to do, since I don&#39;t know you or your son <br/>
or what the actual conversations were that triggered his intense <br/>
reaction. On the basis of what you&#39;re saying, though, here&#39;s what I might<br/>
do:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you can actually speak with him, but you could <br/>
communicate. How would you feel about writing him a note or an email <br/>
to ask for a truce? I think I would tell him that I can see he&#39;s <br/>
**really** upset with me, and that I want to understand better what <br/>
his issue is and help him work this through so we can heal our <br/>
relationship. I would tell him that I&#39;m the same person I&#39;ve always <br/>
been and that I love him hugely and am sad to see him in so much <br/>
pain. I would also ask him if there may be someone else he&#39;d feel <br/>
comfortable with to work this through. I would be sure to apologize <br/>
for any way I might have hurt or confused him without my knowing <br/>
(but, that&#39;s the way I am).<br/>
<br/>
I think those actions may at least get your toe in the door, but I <br/>
really don&#39;t know. Please keep us posted about this and let us know <br/>
what happens. I&#39;ll be thinking of you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890237734">Hi, Dawn, I want to tell you how sorry I am that this happened. And I<br/>
am really thinking of you and sending you good thoughts.<br/>
 <br/>
First, I would have to say that I think you and your child should see<br/>
someone professionally as soon as possible. A therapist could really<br/>
bring some insight to what the root of the problem is. I wouldn&#39;t let<br/>
the person dwell on unschooling or anything out of this range, a lot<br/>
of times therapists want a quick solution,  just stick with the<br/>
situation that is in front of you. Your son has a lot of anger and<br/>
right now he is not seeing you as a good person. It doesn&#39;t look like<br/>
this will just go away on its own, it will probably just keep coming<br/>
up and coming up maybe even in different forms.<br/>
  <br/>
If your child is seeing sex as something dirty you need  to find out<br/>
where that information came from. It just may be that he has seen some<br/>
images either on tv or online that were really hard core.<br/>
 But it seems to me that he is really sending up some danger signals.<br/>
I think you could talk about this for a long time and still never get<br/>
to the core of what is happened in his head. <br/>
<br/>
I also have to disagree with someone telling you to apologize. Your<br/>
son might think you are really guilty of something bad if you keep<br/>
apologizing for nothing. (what would you be apologizing for? having<br/>
sex? That is NOTHING to be ashamed of or that you need to be SORRY<br/>
about. That is what brought that child into this world. Beautiful,<br/>
consensual sex should be revered and honored not apologized for. I<br/>
think your son needs to know or be reminded that it is a wonderful,<br/>
beautiful thing to have sex with the person you love and even some ppl<br/>
you don&#39;t;). But also all sex is not the same, there is also dangerous<br/>
scary sex, molestation, rape, incest. There are appropriate ways to<br/>
explain abuse to a child of 10, I explain to my 9 yr old, that<br/>
violence can take many forms. And that the victims is never guilty or<br/>
bad, simply because something bad has happened to them. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing, have you talked about the fact that he himself is a<br/>
direct result of sex and so is everyone he knows!! <br/>
<br/>
If he is lashing out at you directly, I would think that it is because<br/>
he feels safe enough with you to try to defuse and process whatever<br/>
has happened and still be in a place of love. Feel good that he knows<br/>
you love him enough to support him through this, even if that is<br/>
unconcious on his part. But his actions are not appropriate, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t apologize and let him call you vile names, I would get him<br/>
some help. <br/>
Good luck to you, and know that you are really supported here!!<br/>

From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:southernbelle@...">southernbelle@...</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the last few weeks my ds (10) has been asking questions about sex. <br/>
We<br/>
have had some really good conversations about it. He is very embarrassed<br/>
about anything having to do with sex so I was very happy that he was <br/>
able to<br/>
even ask. I answered all of his questions as honestly as I could. He <br/>
told me<br/>
after each conversation that he was so grateful that he had a mother <br/>
who was<br/>
not embarrassed to talk about sex and everything was so great.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
But has he talked to friends about it or played on the &#39;net to see what <br/>
it *looks* like?<br/>
<br/>
I remember being ten and having two friends tell me what it was all <br/>
about. I KNEW they were lying through their teeth---NOTHING could be <br/>
that disgusting! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Duncan, at ten, has a better idea about sex than I did, but he still <br/>
finds it pretty gross. He laughs at sex jokes on Family Guy---and loves <br/>
Stephen Lynch&#39;s &quot;The Bad Professor&quot; song, but he&#39;s actually still in <br/>
the dark about what it *really* is. I mean---he groans at all the right <br/>
spots, but I think he&#39;s just following the laugh tracks and our own <br/>
rolling eyes! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday he had a couple of questions for me and, again, I answered <br/>
them<br/>
the best I could. Somehow the conversation took a turn and he started <br/>
to get<br/>
upset. He started asking personal questions about me and his dad&#39;s sex <br/>
life.<br/>
He said that he didn&#39;t want me and his dad having sex anymore. When I <br/>
asked<br/>
him why he said because it embarrassed him. He became very upset and was<br/>
crying and very angry. He went to his room and took a long nap. I <br/>
thought<br/>
maybe he had just been tired and he would feel better when he woke up. <br/>
He<br/>
did for a few minutes after he woke up. He came to me and gave me a hug <br/>
and<br/>
said he was sorry. We joked a little about his hormones, which we had <br/>
just<br/>
talked about earlier during the day. (I should mention that dh is out of<br/>
town for a couple of days) Everything seemed fine and we got ready to <br/>
go get<br/>
some dinner. He asked me a kind of off-handed question as we were <br/>
leaving<br/>
and then got very irate. He started yelling, calling me a disgusting <br/>
sicko.<br/>
I tried to talk to him but he said &quot;Just get away from me you sicko!&quot; I <br/>
was<br/>
very hurt but I decided to leave him alone and let him calm down. He <br/>
didn&#39;t.<br/>
In the drive-through in the car he asked me how many toothpicks it would<br/>
take to spell out sicko. He wouldn&#39;t talk to me all night. He kept <br/>
slamming<br/>
things around and walking by my room where I was laying in bed. To be <br/>
honest<br/>
I was a little afraid to go to sleep last night and considered locking <br/>
my<br/>
door because he seemed SO angry. I called his dad and told him what was<br/>
going on and dh tried to talk to him. Then when I woke up this morning <br/>
he<br/>
had posted signs all over the house saying sicko. He sent me about 50 <br/>
emails<br/>
calling me a disgusting sicko and one saying that he would never speak <br/>
to me<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Help!!!<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re going through this---but think about it:  it DOES seem <br/>
pretty sicko from a ten year old point of view---and *I* would actually <br/>
hope that it WOULD! I wouldn&#39;t want a ten year old to think it&#39;s <br/>
something he should run out and do. The sicko feeling is probably <br/>
*healthy*!<br/>
<br/>
Plus, I think the idea of your *PARENTS&#39;* doing anything remotely <br/>
sexual would seem weird to a kid---it&#39;s still weird for ME to think <br/>
about my parents&#39; having sex! &lt;bwg&gt; I remember when Cam and I were <br/>
discussing sex when he was 17: he was a little weirded out when I told <br/>
him that his dad and I had had sex as recently as that morning. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be OK. Time and patience. But I hope he&#39;ll try to <br/>
explain *why* he&#39;s having such strong feelings. I&#39;m sure neither of you <br/>
likes to be in this position! He&#39;s probably really, really confused and <br/>
weirded out.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry---no words of wisdom. Maybe someone else has been in this <br/>
situation?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060610410">These are some very good points.<br/>
<br/>
No, we are not Christians and have no hierarchy in our religion. He and his<br/>
dad don&#39;t have a very close relationship and honestly I would be a little<br/>
concerned about what my dh might say in a conversation like that. He&#39;s not<br/>
very tactful and I think would be too embarrassed himself to have that<br/>
conversation. He thinks ds should figure it out on his own. <br/>
<br/>
We spoke yesterday about hormones and the changes they create in our bodies<br/>
and they changes that would happen to his body in particular. He seemed<br/>
shocked by it all. <br/>
<br/>
I think you are right on all these points and I will see if I can think of<br/>
someone else that he could talk to about this. The only kids he hangs out<br/>
with are his sister(7) and the other homeschoolers we meet once a week for<br/>
recreation. We&#39;ve only been once since we just found them. We moved recently<br/>
and haven&#39;t found many kids in our rural area. <br/>
<br/>
Dawn<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Dawn, do you have a minister/priest/rabbi/iman/pastor/etc who could<br/>
talk to him? I remember my brother went through a similar thing. Sex<br/>
was a dirty word to him at that age. He also told my parents not to<br/>
&quot;do that&quot; anymore. (I think he still likes to believe in immaculate<br/>
conception to answer his and our sibling&#39;s existance even at 34yo and<br/>
a child of his own.) We are sexual creatures. It&#39;s just a part of<br/>
our lives. I remember my mom had our priest talk to my brother about<br/>
some sexual issues he was going through. It helped him to know that<br/>
our priest had sex (Episcopal priests can marry) and had a sexual<br/>
life. It also helped to hear from someone my brother revered that sex<br/>
was natural and a good thing and nothing to be ashamed of.<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen him naked recently? I ask this because I wonder if<br/>
there are some changes going on in his body that maybe happening<br/>
earlier than with other boys his age. Maybe his friends are not going<br/>
through those changes as quickly? Perhaps he said something about the<br/>
presence of hair or enlargement of genetalia or perhaps even an<br/>
erection or sexually vivid dream and was ridiculed or made fun of. I<br/>
remember that my brother went from being &quot;Mr. Exhibitionist&quot; to<br/>
&quot;Eeeek! You might see my body&quot; in just a matter of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
This may be a place where mom can step back and let a trusted male do<br/>
some talking. It may be that anything that you say may make things<br/>
worse. He may find you just trying to justify yourself. Perhaps he<br/>
needs to see a male pov about sexual issues. See things from a &quot;man&#39;s<br/>
perspective&quot; so to speak. And it could be the whole &quot;mother is<br/>
sacred&quot; thing that he is having problems with. He may consider you<br/>
&quot;sicko&quot; because his *mother* did &quot;those things&quot; and for some children<br/>
that is a very difficult thing to consider. To prove that point, I<br/>
was in my late 20&#39;s maybe early 30&#39;s when my mom made some reference<br/>
to her sexualness. (Had to do with not being able to live with the<br/>
Shakers because they don&#39;t have sex.) GASP! My *mom* has sex. And<br/>
then a year or so ago I was helping my mom clean out my dad&#39;s office<br/>
(again) and came across a sample pack of Viagra!! Why would my<br/>
*parents* need *that*? :-D It&#39;s sometimes difficult for even grown<br/>
children who see themselves as sexual creatures to think of their<br/>
parents as sexual creatures.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle - whose 11yo is convinced that there must be some other way<br/>
for people to get pregnant than having sex!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102154431">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I was wondering if some of the things he has seen on TV or just <br/>
passing comments or innuendos may have some effect on his ideas <br/>
about sex. Maybe it&#39;s somehow come across to him as something dirty <br/>
and twisted.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, but I could see that possibly happening if the parents <br/>
*aren&#39;t* talking to their kids about sex. In a case where what they <br/>
overheard is their only source of information, know what I mean?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about you since you posted. I hope you&#39;re doing <br/>
okay with all of this. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626665956">I am getting the feeling from what you all are saying that it&#39;s not him,<br/>
it&#39;s me. I didn&#39;t realize that it&#39;s normal for kids at this age to feel this<br/>
way. That makes me feel a lot better. When I was a kid my dad and mom walked<br/>
around naked after showers and such and I walked in on them several times<br/>
when they were having sex. It was just a part of life and didn&#39;t seem<br/>
strange to me. I guess that was one of the good points of having hippie<br/>
parents (lol). <br/>
<br/>
I think kids get a lot of conflicting ideas about sex these days. It&#39;s<br/>
everywhere!<br/>

explain *why* he&#39;s having such strong feelings. I&#39;m sure neither of you <br/>
likes to be in this position! He&#39;s probably really, really confused and <br/>
weirded out.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry---no words of wisdom. Maybe someone else has been in this <br/>
situation?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-639040344">First let me go look up oedipal (lol). Okay ,got it. That is also a good<br/>
point. We have an extremely close bond. Closer than I&#39;ve ever had with<br/>
another human being. We joke about our twin souls (lol). <br/>

Hi Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
What a difficult situation for you (((((hugs)))))<br/>
<br/>
I hope I&#39;m not out of line in suggesting this but dod you think there could<br/>
be something Oedipal going on ?<br/>
<br/>
I was a single mom to my eldest ds until I met someone and started dating<br/>
when ds was about 5. Although they got on really well (and still do because<br/>
I&#39;ve now been married to the guy for 6 yrs !) my son would completely freak<br/>
out if I went out on dates in the evening. Turns out he was just very scared<br/>
of losing the special relationship we had together.<br/>
<br/>
I just wonder whether your ds - now being aware of the sexual element to<br/>
adult relationships- has realised that this is something you share with dh<br/>
that he can&#39;t share with you ?<br/>
<br/>
Add into the mix his new knowledge of what sex is and I could kind of<br/>
understand where he might be coming from. Maybe the idea of sex grosses him<br/>
out a bit (I know it did me when I first thought about it in any depth!) and<br/>
he&#39;s both grossed out and a little terrified at what this new info means to<br/>
your relationship ?<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts - hope they don&#39;t offend :)<br/>

I did respond to one of his emails this morning but he&#39;s still asleep and<br/>
hasn&#39;t responded yet. I asked him why he thought those things. I don&#39;t know<br/>

<br/>
I am having trouble thinking clearly about how to handle this because I am<br/>
having so many emotions of my own. I am very hurt and to be honest, very<br/>
angry. I have kept my emotions under control throughout the situation and<br/>
tried to be calm and understanding. <br/>
<br/>
I have never been treated like this before. I am just flabbergasted really.<br/>
I think hubby would be sleeping in the driveway if he had treated me this<br/>
way:-) <br/>
<br/>
I know that getting angry will not help the situation at all and will surely<br/>
only make it worse, but right now I am basically just letting him treat me<br/>
this way and I know that is not right either. <br/>
<br/>
Dawn<br/>
<br/>
Whew!! ((((((((Dawn)))))))) This is a tough situation! It&#39;s hard <br/>
for me to know exactly what to do, since I don&#39;t know you or your son <br/>
or what the actual conversations were that triggered his intense <br/>
reaction. On the basis of what you&#39;re saying, though, here&#39;s what I might<br/>
do:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you can actually speak with him, but you could <br/>
communicate. How would you feel about writing him a note or an email <br/>
to ask for a truce? I think I would tell him that I can see he&#39;s <br/>
**really** upset with me, and that I want to understand better what <br/>
his issue is and help him work this through so we can heal our <br/>
relationship. I would tell him that I&#39;m the same person I&#39;ve always <br/>
been and that I love him hugely and am sad to see him in so much <br/>
pain. I would also ask him if there may be someone else he&#39;d feel <br/>
comfortable with to work this through. I would be sure to apologize <br/>
for any way I might have hurt or confused him without my knowing <br/>
(but, that&#39;s the way I am).<br/>
<br/>
I think those actions may at least get your toe in the door, but I <br/>
really don&#39;t know. Please keep us posted about this and let us know <br/>
what happens. I&#39;ll be thinking of you!<br/>

again,&quot; I believe he really meant it then, but this will pass.  There <br/>
have been maybe three times in his life that my son has told me that <br/>

meant it, but I knew it would pass.  But, of course, that&#39;s really <br/>
different, I know, than this.<br/>

your bigger job, I think, is helping *him* through this.<br/>

discussions with friends.  It sounds to me like the information he&#39;s <br/>
gotten about sex has not been good, and he&#39;s using that yardstick to <br/>
determine how he feels about normal sexual behavior.   He needs <br/>
better information than he has right now, and it may not be possible <br/>
for him to discuss this with you ~~ because it&#39;s too intense for <br/>
him.  But you really may need to find him a safe, neutral authority <br/>

Maybe, but I could see that possibly happening if the parents <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-968492178">Lol Yes that was one of his arguments. Sex should be for making babies and<br/>
since we weren&#39;t planning on more we shouldn&#39;t have sex again.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope we can figure it out together. If that doesn&#39;t work we will<br/>
defiantly find someone to help. And yes, I guess I should feel good that he<br/>
can feel safe with me. <br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t think I should apologize because, as you said, it will seem like<br/>
I am doing something wrong. But I am sorry he is feeling this way. <br/>
<br/>
He is awake now so I am going to try to talk to him. This was supposed to be<br/>
a very special week for us. With dh out of town we had planned some special<br/>
things together. I really want to salvage that also.<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Help with ds-sex<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hi, Dawn, I want to tell you how sorry I am that this happened. And I<br/>
am really thinking of you and sending you good thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
First, I would have to say that I think you and your child should see<br/>
someone professionally as soon as possible. A therapist could really<br/>
bring some insight to what the root of the problem is. I wouldn&#39;t let<br/>
the person dwell on unschooling or anything out of this range, a lot<br/>
of times therapists want a quick solution, just stick with the<br/>
situation that is in front of you. Your son has a lot of anger and<br/>
right now he is not seeing you as a good person. It doesn&#39;t look like<br/>
this will just go away on its own, it will probably just keep coming<br/>
up and coming up maybe even in different forms.<br/>
<br/>
If your child is seeing sex as something dirty you need to find out<br/>
where that information came from. It just may be that he has seen some<br/>
images either on tv or online that were really hard core.<br/>
But it seems to me that he is really sending up some danger signals.<br/>
I think you could talk about this for a long time and still never get<br/>
to the core of what is happened in his head. <br/>
<br/>
I also have to disagree with someone telling you to apologize. Your<br/>
son might think you are really guilty of something bad if you keep<br/>
apologizing for nothing. (what would you be apologizing for? having<br/>
sex? That is NOTHING to be ashamed of or that you need to be SORRY<br/>
about. That is what brought that child into this world. Beautiful,<br/>
consensual sex should be revered and honored not apologized for. I<br/>
think your son needs to know or be reminded that it is a wonderful,<br/>
beautiful thing to have sex with the person you love and even some ppl<br/>
you don&#39;t;). But also all sex is not the same, there is also dangerous<br/>
scary sex, molestation, rape, incest. There are appropriate ways to<br/>
explain abuse to a child of 10, I explain to my 9 yr old, that<br/>
violence can take many forms. And that the victims is never guilty or<br/>
bad, simply because something bad has happened to them. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing, have you talked about the fact that he himself is a<br/>
direct result of sex and so is everyone he knows!! <br/>
<br/>
If he is lashing out at you directly, I would think that it is because<br/>
he feels safe enough with you to try to defuse and process whatever<br/>
has happened and still be in a place of love. Feel good that he knows<br/>
you love him enough to support him through this, even if that is<br/>
unconcious on his part. But his actions are not appropriate, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t apologize and let him call you vile names, I would get him<br/>
some help. <br/>
Good luck to you, and know that you are really supported here!!<br/>

when he really needs something else.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he might be ready for a visit with the local family planning  <br/>
center. At my last disabililty conference, i chatted with the teacher  <br/>
of a sex ed class for kids, and it was really amazing. I&#39;m looking  <br/>
into dropping Josh off at one, really respectful, emphasizing  <br/>

&gt; things together. I really want to salvage that also.<br/>

<br/>
I remember my now adult kids asking if dad and I had sex anymore. I <br/>
think in the end my answer became my sex life is one of the private <br/>
parts of my life.  I think I came to that conclusion for some of the <br/>
same issues you are having. My sons seperately, at similar ages to <br/>
your son asked questions and thought that me being sexual was gross. <br/>
They said the exact same things to me and became upset. <br/>
<br/>
When I really consider my own sexaulity that only person I want to <br/>
imagine having sex is me. Imagining other people seems a bit invasive. <br/>
Well sometimes as a sexual fantasy, but that is another story.<br/>
<br/>
My adult sons will now call me with sexual concerns. And the <br/>
conversation seems very normal. <br/>
<br/>
But it seems I definately remember them having upset and discomfort <br/>
over my sexaulity. That was when I decided that it was a private <br/>
matter. Not sex, but my sex life.<br/>
<br/>
I do tell my kids when dad and I need alone time. Sometimes it is just <br/>
to talk or do other things, but it is part of our private lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836291686">My DD is 10 and we have talked about sex with her but not in any extra<br/>
detail.  We tell her when we need alone time... but I know at this point<br/>
that too many details would gross her out.  I&#39;ve begun to discuss puberty<br/>
with her because her body is changing... and she&#39;s a bit grossed out by that<br/>
.. so I know that too many extra details about sex would just not go over<br/>
well with her right now.<br/>
<br/>
I really hope that you can get this all workout out with our DS soon.  And<br/>
maybe you and DH need to talk more about the relationship between DS and DH.<br/>
. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-929122223">Hi Dawn<br/>
<br/>
If it is any help to you to hear this:<br/>
<br/>
Although the way in which dd has expressed his feelings seems rather <br/>
strong, and perhaps unusual, I do not think that the fact that he feels <br/>
disgusted and upset is at all unusual, given his age.<br/>
<br/>
Here is another thought that I have not seen in the responses:<br/>
<br/>
I would think he has been experimenting with masturbation. For some kids, <br/>
depending on their exposure, this may be troubling and guilt-inducing. Is <br/>
he suffering from strong guilt feelings about his own desires? Add that to <br/>
the Oedipus complex mentioned by another poster, and you have a great <br/>
recipe for lots and lots of energy!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, in case you had, don&#39;t even THINK of raising these issues directly <br/>
with him, at least not now!<br/>
<br/>

&gt;It sounds to me like the information he&#39;s <br/>
&gt; gotten about sex has not been good, and he&#39;s using that yardstick to <br/>
&gt; determine how he feels about normal sexual behavior.   He needs <br/>
&gt; better information than he has right now<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking this also.<br/>
<br/>
When dd began asking many, many questions at the age of about 6, we <br/>
answered as blandly, yet bluntly as we could. We also found this book:<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s So Amazing! by Robie H. Harris, Michael Emberley<br/>
see:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/imageviewer.asp?ean=9780763613211&MICTID=27">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/imageviewer.asp?ean=9780763613211&MICTID=27</a><br/>
<br/>
(if that link wraps poorly for you, try:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://w3t.org/u/xn4">http://w3t.org/u/xn4</a><br/>
which is shorter, but has an advertising frame.)<br/>
<br/>
It tells a story from the perspective of a green, eager bird, and a little, <br/>
completely disgusted and grossed out bee. It is very frank and clear, and <br/>
also very gentle and kind. She loved it. We read it cover to cover <br/>
together, which is the best way for a younger child, I would think.<br/>
<br/>
It is GLB friendly, and makes no religious value judgements, so perhaps it <br/>
is not suited for all persuasions.<br/>
<br/>
I think every home should have one.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, it will pass.<br/>

<br/>
For the last few weeks my ds (10) has been asking questions about sex. We<br/>
have had some really good conversations about it. He is very embarrassed<br/>
about anything having to do with sex so I was very happy that he was able to<br/>
even ask. I answered all of his questions as honestly as I could. He told me<br/>
after each conversation that he was so grateful that he had a mother who was<br/>
not embarrassed to talk about sex and everything was so great. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday he had a couple of questions for me and, again, I answered them<br/>
the best I could. Somehow the conversation took a turn and he started to get<br/>
upset. He started asking personal questions about me and his dad&#39;s sex life.<br/>
He said that he didn&#39;t want me and his dad having sex anymore. When I asked<br/>
him why he said because it embarrassed him. He became very upset and was<br/>
crying and very angry. He went to his room and took a long nap. I thought<br/>
maybe he had just been tired and he would feel better when he woke up. He<br/>
did for a few minutes after he woke up. He came to me and gave me a hug and<br/>
said he was sorry. We joked a little about his hormones, which we had just<br/>
talked about earlier during the day. (I should mention that dh is out of<br/>
town for a couple of days) Everything seemed fine and we got ready to go get<br/>
some dinner. He asked me a kind of off-handed question as we were leaving<br/>
and then got very irate. He started yelling, calling me a disgusting sicko.<br/>
I tried to talk to him but he said &quot;Just get away from me you sicko!&quot; I was<br/>
very hurt but I decided to leave him alone and let him calm down. He didn&#39;t.<br/>
In the drive-through in the car he asked me how many toothpicks it would<br/>
take to spell out sicko. He wouldn&#39;t talk to me all night. He kept slamming<br/>
things around and walking by my room where I was laying in bed. To be honest<br/>
I was a little afraid to go to sleep last night and considered locking my<br/>
door because he seemed SO angry. I called his dad and told him what was<br/>
going on and dh tried to talk to him. Then when I woke up this morning he<br/>
had posted signs all over the house saying sicko. He sent me about 50 emails<br/>
calling me a disgusting sicko and one saying that he would never speak to me<br/>
again. <br/>
<br/>
Help!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-973474770">This book is not just for you.  It is for everyone who cares to understand how a child may perceive things.  I have too little information to have any *feel* about your situation.  But I do know that giving certain information (such as sexual information) before a child is ready is very damaging.  That is why there are ratings for entertainment products.  Children are naturally curious, when come across something they dont know, they will always ask.  Just because they ask doesnt mean they are ready for that information.<br/>
