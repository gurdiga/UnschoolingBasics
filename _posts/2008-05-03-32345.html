<br/>
What brought you to unschooling?  What have you read about unschooling?  Why do you want to unschool? <br/>
<br/>
***... most of what u all say and do, cannot<br/>
be applied to an Indian home. :( ***<br/>
<br/>
Can you elaborate?  What&#39;s so different about where you live that trust and respect cannot exist?<br/>
<br/>
*** I end up daily feeling guilty about the<br/>
authorative statements i make and TIME OUT that i issue.***<br/>
<br/>
Well, you should feel guilty. &lt;g&gt;    Those feelings will be part of the reason you&#39;ll be able to change.  The next time you&#39;re going to respond to your child, stop for a moment and think about what you want to say and how you want to say it and how you will appear in your child&#39;s eyes.    Then choose the words that will most benefit your child and will be the least likely to leave you wishing you hadn&#39;t said them.   It will take time.  <br/>
Stopping to think will be really helpful. <br/>
<br/>
Apologize if you say something you regret. <br/>
<br/>
