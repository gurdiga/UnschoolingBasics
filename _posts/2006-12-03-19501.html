<div id="ygrps-yiv-251425045">Hi Heather,<br/>
<br/>
I suggest using diapers or pullups and forget about potty training for<br/>
awhile.  My son wasn&#39;t interested at that age either.  We tried to insist<br/>
and he ended up proving to us that he was in control by not pooping at all &<br/>
ended up constipated.  A very painful situation for all of us.  So we put<br/>
the diapers back on.  And waited.  He was in a mothers day out program a<br/>
couple mornings a week at the time and over Christmas break, they told me he<br/>
couldn&#39;t come back unless he was potty trained.  He was 4 yrs old by then.<br/>
So I told him that.  And it was his choice, whether he wanted to continue at<br/>
the MDO program.  He basically potty-trained himself over the holiday break.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My younger daughter trained herself about the time she was 3.  She surprised<br/>
us!  We weren&#39;t even thinking about it, since we&#39;d been so stressed out<br/>
about my son&#39;s experience.<br/>
<br/>
sincerely,<br/>
another Heather<br/>

You won&#39;t. Nobody will. He&#39;ll learn those things when they&#39;re<br/>
meaningful for HIM and no sooner. The faster you can accept his own<br/>
learning as the most important factor, the faster you&#39;ll begin to<br/>
understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You can keep on &quot;teaching&quot; him to use the toilet and eventually he&#39;ll<br/>
get it (possibly with more stress on both your parts than necessary)<br/>
but he&#39;ll get it because he&#39;s READY to get it, not because you taught him.<br/>
Instead of focusing on it so much, just embrace exactly where he&#39;s at<br/>
right now and enjoy this time. He&#39;ll figure out how to use a toilet,<br/>
he&#39;ll figure out how to read, he&#39;ll figure out things you wouldn&#39;t<br/>
even dream of teaching him...IF you can learn to trust.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching is irrelevant. Learning is everything. Trust that he needs to<br/>
do things in his own time, in his own way and simply be there for him,<br/>
supporting his own efforts. Earlier isn&#39;t better. Early potty<br/>
training, early reading early ANYTHING is no better than &quot;late&quot;. When<br/>
he&#39;s 20 years old, you honestly won&#39;t be able to tell when he learned<br/>
any of those things. What matters more is that he&#39;ll have happy,<br/>
joyful memories of a mother that was peacefully travelling the path<br/>
with him, not pushing him to learn things.<br/>

myself worked into a lather about things too often... I realized<br/>
today (after getting my &#39;monthly friend&#39;) that likely my nagging<br/>
worries about this and other things have been hormone induced. I&#39;ve<br/>
been working with my son on Potty Training and not having much<br/>
success and the more books I read about it, most of them refering<br/>
to &#39;2 and SOMETIMES 3 year olds&#39; gets me to thinking &quot;Oh my<br/>
goodness! He&#39;s three and a 1/2! I HAVE TO GET IT DONE!!!&quot; When, in<br/>
my calmer moments, I am more of a &#39;he has his own timing and will<br/>
learn when it&#39;s important to him&#39;. He is interested in the potty <br/>
training books and likes to hear the stories, so I&#39;ll continue to <br/>
read them to him and just TRUST that he&#39;ll &#39;get it&#39; when he decides <br/>
the time is right... Thanks again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971164435">Heather,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! I&#39;ve heard from a few people about older children (three and <br/>
four yr olds) doing just that, deciding to start using the toilet <br/>
and then doing so... But since my son hasn&#39;t yet and is somewhat <br/>
resistant to the whole thing, I started getting myself all worked <br/>
up... I guess I should just calm down about the whole deal and trust <br/>
him to know his own timing. He&#39;s very into his ABC&#39;s and numbers <br/>
right now, learning all the time on that score... He points out <br/>
letter/numbers whenever he see&#39;s them and says &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; for <br/>
every letter and never tires of talking about them... So I guess <br/>
he&#39;s just got &#39;other things on his mind&#39; and potty training isn&#39;t <br/>
one of them right now. I am new to the unschooling ideas and was <br/>
such a &#39;schooled&#39; person that it&#39;s hard to get the ideas to &#39;stick&#39; <br/>
(here I am getting myself worked up about my son&#39;s not being potty <br/>
trained when, even when I want to, I can&#39;t seem to get &#39;unschool <br/>
trained&#39;! LOL!) I am trying to relax and embrace the &#39;live love <br/>
learn&#39; ideas as I do so love the harmonious feelings they inspire in <br/>
me and want them for my family. Please be patient with me everyone, <br/>
I am trying! :)<br/>
Smiles and Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271434839">If he is willing to try it, not resisting, I&#39;d let him go bare bottom<br/>
with a long t-shirt. (maybe even a sweatshirt). Keep the thermastat up<br/>
a couple degrees. If he&#39;s being resistant to it, obviously it&#39;s better<br/>
to wait. <br/>
<br/>
My kids all learned very early.  day and night dry and independent<br/>
(except wiping) by 25mths. People think I pushed them but I didn&#39;t. No<br/>
punishment, rewards, stress. I just stopped using diapers, let them<br/>
roam bare bottom and helped them become aware of their bodies. It&#39;s<br/>
all about opportunities, just like everything else. Helping them to<br/>
become aware. I had a language delayed boy as well (go figure, a<br/>
speech therapist with a language delayed child! LOL), but we used<br/>
signing, which helped a lot. Personally, I think it&#39;s much easier for<br/>
younger toddlers to ease into toileting. Their interests are less<br/>
diverse than older toddlers and they tend to be much more cooperative<br/>
(haven&#39;t hit the autonomy stage yet). <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d go for it with your dd. Girls tend to learn quicker and at younger<br/>
ages and she may be the motivation for your son. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477465139">Per a quick search on the internet, I found that the most common<br/>
source of inability to control the bladder to be related to allergies.<br/>
Evidently, 50% of children who eliminated cow dairy became more<br/>
toileting abled. The other most allergenic foods were chocolate, eggs,<br/>
citrus fruits, and wheat.<br/>
<br/>
I saw that bed wetting (enuresis) is highly hereditary. If both<br/>
parents had issues, than 77% of their children have issues with<br/>
inability to control the bladder. If only one parent, than 44% of<br/>
children had issues.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently 20% of 5 year olds are not fully toileting. 14% of 7 year<br/>
olds are not; 4% of 12 year olds; and 1-2% of 15 year olds are not<br/>
fully toileting. Nighttime control is most difficult, especially for<br/>
boys and for those who sleep deeply. Avoiding liquids after 6pm<br/>
appears to help.<br/>
<br/>
Indication for medical intervention is not typically recommended until<br/>
age 6 or 7. However most children who are not toileting independently<br/>
at 6, won&#39;t be at 7. Most concerns about toileting accidents were<br/>
related to urinary tract infections, diabetes and neurological issues.<br/>
<br/>
Our son decided to use the toilet consistently around his 5th<br/>
birthday. He had no apparent physical reason, but had refused interest<br/>
in toileting. He prefered diapers. He was totally aware when he needed<br/>
to go. We had tried softer, smaller toilet seats for comfort, the &#39;wet<br/>
sensation training diapers&#39;, several different potty chairs, kept the<br/>
chairs nearby, encouraged when visible signs of voiding, etc.<br/>
Apparently, he was more comfortable standing to deficate, and too busy<br/>
to stop to void. I was fully comfortable that he would use the toilet<br/>
when he was ready and developmentally able. And he no longer needed<br/>
diapers at night at the same point. I believe it had to do with a<br/>
desire for complete autonomy in toileting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999855273">Although my son wasn&#39;t a late bloomer in this, if you go by what the<br/>
books say, I did everything wrong.  I suspect that, when they are<br/>
ready, they are ready.  Has he asked to stop using diapers?  If not,<br/>
don&#39;t worry.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fairly confident that he will not be going to college in diapers!<br/>
<br/>
Oh -- one thing, I don&#39;t think you should use the pull-ups that they<br/>
sell.  They mask the feedback, so there is no signal that he is going,<br/>
really.  <br/>
<br/>
When we started, it was winter, too.  First time in underpants, my son<br/>
pretty much finished the job before he got to the bathroom.  (Total<br/>
shock, I think!)  Second time he stopped about half-way -- still a lot<br/>
to clean up, but more in the toilet.  Next time he barely got wet. <br/>
The problem we had was with #2.  Quirky kid -- he was fine if he was<br/>
bottomless, but if he was wearing pants, didn&#39;t want to stop what he<br/>
was doing to get undressed. (Or some such -- I don&#39;t know, really,<br/>
what his internal thought process was!)  However, it was generally<br/>
VERY apparent that he was about to have a bm, so I learned to quickly<br/>
pull down the pants (gotta love elastic waists!), and then he was fine<br/>
about using the appropriate recepticle.<br/>
<br/>
Also, my son wasn&#39;t too big on the potty chair, and generally used the<br/>
toilet -- backwards most often.  Feel free to wait, experiment, etc. <br/>
My son is almost 15, and, despite my doing almost everything<br/>
differently than the books say to do, he seems fairly well adjusted!  <br/>

back in diapers and when he is ready it will happen.  I&#39;ll ask you<br/>
this question, Do you know *any* adults with no limitations who are<br/>
not potty trained?  My son was over 4 before he was ready to go the<br/>
day without diapers and he was over 5 before he was going through the<br/>
night without diapers.  We tried several times to get him toilet<br/>
learned but he just wasn&#39;t ready.  I had a choice (and so do you) put<br/>
him in underwear and continue to be frustrated and angry because he<br/>
isn&#39;t &quot;learning&quot; or put him in diapers and give him a bit more time.<br/>
He&#39;s still *little*  He&#39;s *only 3.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Amen! I&#39;ve decided to! Thanks for your story... I just need to get <br/>
the &#39;timing&#39; thing out of my head... you know, expectations based on <br/>
his &#39;age&#39; and whatnot... Seems everything you read in the books <br/>
on &#39;how to potty train&#39; talk about 2-3 yr olds and it give you a <br/>
complex if you let it... I think I just need to throw out the <br/>
parenting manuals and rely MUCH MORE on my gut instincts and the <br/>
signals my kids give me... It would allow for much more peace in my <br/>
household and in my mind... and thiers too, I am sure... <br/>
<br/>
Reformed from Expectations based on &#39;cookie cutter kids manuals&#39; (or <br/>
trying to be!) <br/>
