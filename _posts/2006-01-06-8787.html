<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513707670">After reading Gayle&#39;s words of discouragement with the kids and the art <br/>
set, many responses came in about the &quot;Control&quot; issue.  I wonder how <br/>
many of us Unschoolers are also learning to be Uncontrollers!! As <br/>
we &quot;get Unschooling&quot;, do we also &quot;get uncontrolling?!&quot; I mean do we <br/>
really &quot;control&quot; any one?  Especially our children and their real <br/>
learning?  I too have discovered so much more about me as the process <br/>
of unschooling evolved in our lives.  I love the things I am <br/>
discovering.  This &quot;Unschooling&quot; flows into EVERY part of my life!  I <br/>
cannot &quot;Control&quot; any person!  I can &quot;kinda&quot; control &quot;things&quot;...like <br/>
bills, cleaning, etc...BUT for &quot;control&quot; over people...NO way!   I <br/>
think this path has been extremely healthy for me to release my control <br/>
issues!  I just need to &quot;release&quot; the &quot;guilt?&quot; of NOT being &quot;stressed <br/>
out and uptight&quot; about their learning!  My kids are &quot;enjoying&quot; their <br/>
lives!  They are not bound to a desk and workbooks!  I feel so free, <br/>
but can this freedom be real?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898819608">I am a really laid back person but even I forget that children learn best on<br/>
their own. Anyway, when I do start telling my son what to do - he tells me<br/>
he has had enough and that I need to go away now. Which I do and let him do<br/>
his thing. So my suggestion that when you feel that controlling beat spread<br/>
over you... walk away. You don&#39;t need to watch your kids learn. If they make<br/>
a mess then you help them clean it up. I do believe in teaching taking<br/>
responsibility for yourself and that includes cleaning up after yourself.<br/>
However, even that will be done in their own way. If they don&#39;t do it the<br/>
way you would then let them clean and then clean behind them. After all they<br/>
are children and not Adults.<br/>

I walk away too when I make a suggestion and my dd says no.  But I <br/>
struggle with am I just letting her play PS2, computer or TV all day?  <br/>
Is that all she is going to do.  That is why I make the suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m a controller and trying to deal with it isn&#39;t easy, but at <br/>
times I hear the old tapes and want to see her get out and meet <br/>
people, play outdoors, go to a museum, etc.  Hard to just shut up and <br/>
walk away even though I do walk away and except that she will start <br/>
doing things when she is ready.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506293780">I do understand because everyone I know thinks I am either too laid back or<br/>
a control freak but yes - sometimes it is okay to just play video games all<br/>
day. I really wish my mom had let me do just that. There are games that are<br/>
at the base nothing more then a story but you still learn something. Mine<br/>
was Willow for the original Nitendo. It was a role playing game and you had<br/>
to build up your character, follow directions, find new equipment, make good<br/>
choice. Now there are games that are like that but better - PS2 and Xbox has<br/>
a jedi game that you can play over and over and each time it is different<br/>
depending of the life choice you make, there are ocean exploration games and<br/>
oftern getting the cheat books make good text books because there are maps<br/>
to follow and helpful hints and interactions that some would not think of<br/>
that makes the game even more instructive.<br/>
<br/>
Even just playing Tetris all day can give the brain a work out. Eventually,<br/>
though they will search out something new because their fingers will begin<br/>
to hurt. Also, one my son wants to get is the dance party game - I think you<br/>
can get it for PS2 as well (we have Xbox). There are days that my son sits<br/>
and plays with play dough all day - is that any worse then a video or<br/>
computer game?<br/>
