<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599221724">Despite my extensive list yesterday of things we can<br/>
do here to make my DH happy, I truly believe with<br/>
Brooke, I could conjure up a list based on what she<br/>
does all day long.  She is always writing, always<br/>
playing Zoo Tycoon, always spelling, saying math<br/>
problems allowed, etc.  I&#39;ll try it because you all<br/>
just, ugh, cannot find the words.  When I wrote down<br/>
my list, I felt so guilty for &quot;making&quot; them do school<br/>
even though it is short and fun.  <br/>
<br/>
DS 11, OTH, I&#39;m sorry to say that I could not honestly<br/>
conjure up anything even remotely looking schoolish by<br/>
what he does on his own, other than Garfield typing<br/>
and Garfield quiz game, Harry Potter for reading. <br/>
I&#39;ve never been a creative.  Most sites I go to for<br/>
creativity are geared for younger children and also<br/>
more for girls.  I&#39;ve got a woodshop book that I&#39;m<br/>
happy to do with him, but when I ask if he&#39;d like to<br/>
make something it&#39;s met with a casual, &quot;No, thats<br/>
okay&quot;.  I do not make him feel bad at all.  <br/>
<br/>
He loves video games, and that is fine by me.  I asked<br/>
him if he&#39;d like to maybe be a video game creator, we<br/>
can get the software, etc.  &quot;No, that&#39;s okay.&quot;  I<br/>
don&#39;t know, feeling at my wits end.  Maybe its just<br/>
taking longer for Zak to click with something and I<br/>
should probably stop worrying.  I want to help him,<br/>
help him find his passion, but he has no desire for<br/>
anything.  A few months back when I tried totally<br/>
unschooling, it was me coming up with everything to<br/>
do, me always presenting ideas but never on his part. <br/>
If I didn&#39;t come up with something, he&#39;d just sit and<br/>
lie around..unless he played something.  <br/>
<br/>
I love him for who he is today, but I can&#39;t lie and<br/>
say that I&#39;m not a little concerned about his future. <br/>
:-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456043055">I don&#39;t have much time, but I&#39;ve got two suggestions. First, have <br/>
you ever done a project in wood-working out of that book yourself? <br/>
Maybe you should. Or if it doesn&#39;t interest you, get involved in <br/>
your own passions and just start doing something fun without asking <br/>
Zak if *he* wants to first and waiting for a &quot;No, that&#39;s okay&quot;. <br/>
Every now and then, he may decide to join in. If you worry he <br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;do enough&quot;, then the problem is probably in your <br/>
perspective, and an indication that you need to make sure *you* <br/>
are &quot;doing enough&quot; and are living a busy, active life.<br/>
<br/>
***He loves video games*** <br/>
***I want to help him...find his passion, but he has no desire for <br/>
anything.***<br/>
<br/>
Your son loves video games. No matter what the reason, your child&#39;s <br/>
heart is drawn to them and they bring him joy. Stop looking for <br/>
where he&#39;s lacking and what he&#39;s NOT doing and really *see* what he <br/>
loves to do, today. He isn&#39;t a lost, wandering soul waiting to &quot;find <br/>
his passion&quot;...he is already passionate about something! Nurture <br/>
that! Join in with him! Of course, continue to expand his world and <br/>
strew all different kinds of things, but also validate and encourage <br/>
the very real passion that is already in his heart.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408909655">Sandy<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Get into his world, see what he loves <br/>
about them. Ask him a few questions and try to play with him if <br/>
possible. His future belongs to him.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandy, I feel slightly out of my element here because my only experience<br/>
unschooling is with one 5 1/2 year old, but I found Ren&#39;s advice to resonate<br/>
through and through.  I have gone &quot;into his world&quot; to &quot;see what he loves...&quot;<br/>
many times, especially when I&#39;ve gone into fear.  I am especially judgmental<br/>
of things that don&#39;t look school-ish.  When I have gotten down with him,<br/>
played and talked with awareness, I have learned quite a bit about why he<br/>
spends time doing things that seem unimportant to me.  While you are there,<br/>
you can both learn a lot by talking to each other (see Jan Fortune-Woods<br/>
latest article in Life Learning Magazine &quot;Life, the Universe and<br/>
Everything&quot;).  You can help him see connections, metaphors, you can ask<br/>
questions, and answer questions...let the talk take you from A to 10 where<br/>
connections never seemed to be possible.  Get to know each other better,<br/>
find out what you like to do together...then do it more.   Your fear of his<br/>
future may be keeping you from being capable of being present with him.<br/>
&quot;Trust&quot;...might be a good mantra...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and another thing...what are YOU passionate about that he sees?  Even<br/>
the littlest passion in us is inspiring to them...but don&#39;t let this be an<br/>
agenda to &quot;get&quot; him to do anything.  Just trust that if he is living around<br/>
passionate people, he will recognize it in himself when it comes and know<br/>
what to do with it...<br/>
