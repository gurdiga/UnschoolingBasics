<div id="ygrps-yiv-20078277">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking for some time here. I am a single mom to a seven <br/>
year old son who is currently attending a public school. I am very <br/>
interested in unschooling and have been readings and learning for <br/>
probably about 1.5 years. I certainly appreciate all the information <br/>
here...it has been valuable to me and my thought processes although <br/>
we are not unschooling as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I tentatively brought the subject up of unschooling our son <br/>
to my ex-husband and as usual we really had a non-productive <br/>
conversation about it. He and I have never communicated well together <br/>
(hence the ex part ;) ) and for many reasons I find it very hard to <br/>
express clearly and concisely my feelings and thoughts to him. He <br/>
also tends to belittle my thoughts and ideas... so my plea to you all <br/>
is for some suggestions of places to send him and things to <br/>
read/websites about unschooling for the sceptical/unsure. I don&#39;t <br/>
really want to hit him too hard with radical unschooling things at <br/>
this point, but move a bit more gently toward explaining it all in a <br/>
way that he may even begin to learn about it. He&#39;s quite &quot;schooly&quot;, <br/>
we both were excellent students and went on to MIT, but while he had <br/>
a good experience, mine was miserable. So we are coming from opposite <br/>
experiences and outlooks on life in general.<br/>
<br/>
I start with that and hope that you can help me a bit.<br/>
Later I may get to the question of how to unschool as a single mom...<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
