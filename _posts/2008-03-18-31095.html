to every part of your life with your child/children, including <br/>
bedtimes, food, and other issues mainstream parents want to mandate. <br/>
It goes beyond traditional thoughts of education to the plan that the <br/>
world is a classroom. It is trust based belief that children will <br/>
gather the information they need. Trust that children are naturally <br/>
curious and capable if supported and given the information they are <br/>
requesting.<br/>
<br/>
Always unschooled means that the children have never been parented or <br/>
educated with other than an unschooling philosophy.<br/>

And eclectic homeschooling means that a  complete curriculum is <br/>
derived from a smattering of different curriculums.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-222056623">Stacey asks:<br/>
What is the difference? ;) i&#39;m confused.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
I use &quot;radical&quot; to emphasize that unschooling is our family&#39;s lifestyle, <br/>
not just a learning method for the kids or a philosophical approach to <br/>
academic work.<br/>
<br/>
I use &quot;always&quot; to mean that my children were never enrolled in <br/>
school(often this makes a difference in what&#39;s being discussed.)<br/>
<br/>
 I used &quot;eclectic&quot; a lot in the early years when I was still figuring <br/>
things out. I don&#39;t use it much anymore for &quot;unschooling&quot; but I do for <br/>
mixed groups of home education families with different types of <br/>
homeschoolers and also unschoolers, all in one.<br/>
<br/>
So these are each distinct and useful adjectives to me, and I might <br/>
conceivably use them all at once in a certain context to describe our <br/>
unschooling, without being redundant.  But like most words and meanings <br/>
nowadays, it seems to me that these aren&#39;t universally used and <br/>
understood the same way by everyone. . .<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s important to know that the term &quot;Radical Unschooling&quot; is a term used<br/>
first by folks who unschool academically and don&#39;t necessarily apply the<br/>
same principles to Whole Life -- kind of a *snarky* term :) It&#39;s been<br/>
re-claimed, sorta, though I don&#39;t like to use it to describe our life  (it&#39;s<br/>
redundant, I&#39;d be Radical no matter *what* I was doing :::vbg:::) I prefer<br/>
Whole Life Learners or Whole Life Unschoolers instead.<br/>
The one group I belong to entitled Radical Unschoolers is one that combines<br/>
our Unchooling lifestyle with the Law of Attraction<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thesecret.tv">http://thesecret.tv</a>&gt;(that&#39;s pretty Radical among even Unschoolers<br/>
::bg::), I don&#39;t mind the term<br/>
as it applies there.<br/>
<br/>
Always Unschooled &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/</a>&gt; is an<br/>
actual support group (I witnessed it&#39;s birth at Live and<br/>
Learn&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://liveandlearnconference.org">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a>&gt;2004!) for parents who have AP<br/>
(Attachment Parenting) principles in place<br/>
and want to continue that kind of parenting all through the child&#39;s life.<br/>
Parents who plan to keep their kids out of school and lead principle driven<br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
Eclectic *unschooling* is a term for folks who claim to be unschooling<br/>
&quot;except for math and ___________&quot; (which really doesn&#39;t uphold the<br/>
unschooling principles of trust that humans *do* learn, hence is *not*<br/>
considered unschooling). Eclectic &quot;homeschooler&quot; is more accurate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065147529">I must be &quot;radical&quot; then and more &quot;eclectic&quot; than I thought, because<br/>
long before 2004 and that group, I was using &quot;always&quot; (back in the<br/>

unschooled, as in never had been sent to SCHOOL, thus hadn&#39;t the usual<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406871399">I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t more clear : It was a term used by Academic Unschoolers<br/>
to describe Whole Life Unchoolers as in, &quot;I&#39;m an unschooler and they&#39;re<br/>
*Radical* unschoolers&quot; -- I guess this means I&#39;ve been around a loooong<br/>
time, as I remember when it was a new term and not so nice... I&#39;m glad the<br/>
reclamation is working :)<br/>
<br/>
(just as the term Lutheran was a snarky term used by the Catholic Church to<br/>
describe catholics who supported Martin Luther and has now grown into<br/>
something else altogether -- to compare this historically)<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t remember it that way....I think &quot;I&quot; might have even been the  <br/>
first or at least one of the first to use the term radical unschooling  <br/>
- it was an adjective I liked to use to describe whole-life  <br/>
unschooling - it wasn&#39;t yet a &quot;thing,&quot; itself.  I remember people  <br/>
telling me they didn&#39;t think it was a good term to use, that it would  <br/>
&quot;turn people off&quot; and that the word &quot;radical&quot; had a negative political  <br/>
stigma, that it meant rebellious and overly extremist and stuff like  <br/>
that. I remember saying that they needed to look it up - it was a  <br/>
GREAT word - it has to do with getting to the &quot;root&quot; of things -  <br/>
fundamental and thorough.<br/>
<br/>
So - really - I think &quot;we&quot; used it first, got flak for it, and kept it.<br/>
