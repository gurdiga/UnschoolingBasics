<br/>
I asked a similar question elsewhere the other day and someone suggested this <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.microbric.com/">http://www.microbric.com/</a> It&#39;s more affordable than Lego mindstorms but possibly a bit more complicated. There are a few robot kits on amazon too, we&#39;ve built the brushbot before which wasnt too complicated but there are some amazing (and complicated!) ones on there too that might be potentially a project to do together.<br/>

I as assuming you live in Australia and what your philosophy is about<br/>
utilizing resources/collaborating with local resources. In the US, a number<br/>
of schools have after-school robotics clubs etc. which might learning<br/>
easier as well as more resource-efficient. I don&#39;t know how Australian<br/>
school systems work but in case there are options like that, it may be a<br/>
useful way of pooling in resources. I don&#39;t mind getting access to local<br/>
school resources (especially since my tax dollars fund the system) but my<br/>
son prefers one on one interactions to group interactions. So it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
work for us. Have you also checked out local, amateur robotics groups in<br/>
the community or local colleges<br/>
<br/>
I have had also good luck with Homeschooling Co-ops (online) in buying such<br/>
high-ticket items at reduced prices because of group buys. I have bought<br/>
stuff for prices that are discounted even unto 35-45%, which is very pretty<br/>
sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-478053597">Have you taken a look at Motorized Mechanisms out at the LEGO educational<br/>
site?  Your son is 11 but he might still find the engineering sets<br/>
interesting prior to moving to Mindstorms.  (e.g. Motorized Mechanisms<br/>
explores gearing, torque, balance, etc - it could be a useful precursor to<br/>
Mindstorms)  I doubt you have to do it as a &quot;schooly&quot; activity.  My son is<br/>
doing the We Do educational kits, and we aren&#39;t bothering with the schoolish<br/>
aspect, just building and playing around with them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Have you tried eBay for a used Mindstorms set?  I bet lots of people buy<br/>
them and use them for a short time and then they just sit gathering dust.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You might also try asking in your local homeschooling / unschooling<br/>
community if anyone has some to borrow.  (or come over and try out, to see<br/>
if you like it enough to spend the money)  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As an unschooler, he may or may not be interested in a class.  Around here<br/>
there are LEGO engineering classes & clubs.  Maybe that ends up as expensive<br/>
as the Mindstorms set though, since they don&#39;t seem to be cheap.  There is<br/>
First Lego League here; don&#39;t know if they have it where you are.  That<br/>
involves teamwork and problem solving but is more structured than just<br/>
getting the Mindstorms kit and playing around with it (which sounds like<br/>
more fun).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Have you had a look at Make Magazine?  All sorts of cool projects, and the<br/>
Maker Shed (their store) has a variety of kits for basic robotic projects<br/>
that don&#39;t use Arduino (although many do).  Might be a good gateway into<br/>
Arduino eventually, once he&#39;s completed a few of the basic projects and is<br/>
feeling more confident.<br/>

Magazine is makezine.com).  I love reading through the magazine and just<br/>
seeing what cool stuff people make.  It&#39;s quite inspiring.   Check out their<br/>
site and some of the projects from past issues.  A couple issues ago was all<br/>
on Toys.  Neat.<br/>

<br/>
Questions to consider: what kinds of robots?<br/>
What do you mean by &quot;play with&quot;?<br/>
and  how much programming does he like to do?<br/>
<br/>
 The Lego mindstorms kits are geared toward programming and the actual robots, while very &quot;real&quot; do things which a lot of kids find totally uninspiring - they&#39;re dull, utility robots which do very simple things like detect a flashing light or follow a line and there&#39;s not much actual construction. The microbots kits are along the same lines, although with more actual construction - better for kids who like electronics. These are things with a lot of &quot;educational&quot; appeal, but unless your kid already has a fascination for real world robotics, electronics, or programming, they&#39;re not worth throwing money at. <br/>
<br/>
Does he want to fight with robots? Look into battle bots if so. Those are mostly cars and car-like robots, remote controlled, some using mindstorm components, some not. There are clubs and tournaments for that sort of thing. <br/>
<br/>
If he wants to play with cute robot-ish things, I&#39;d look at K&#39;nex kits, which have some cars and bugs at very low prices. They won&#39;t appeal to a kid who likes real live robotics but the will appeal to a kid who likes robot movies and stories and games, but doesn&#39;t really care about teaching a block on wheels to run into walls and turn around.<br/>

We shared this with a group of children, it was amazing the different designs they came up with. They then moved on to having battles with them, and kept having to come back to fix and improve their bugs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-313711506">Thank you everyone for your great ideas and suggestions. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you also Meredith for the reminder to take a step back and think about what I meant by &quot;playing with robots&quot;. This was really useful, and it really helped my son clarify what he did and didn&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
It helped him get from &quot;I dunno, just robots!&quot; to &quot;well, they&#39;re not fun if I can&#39;t program them, and I want to do some battle bots&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
BTW - The microblocs viper seems to fit the criteria, and we found a couple on ebay pretty cheap. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-527479521">This is a timely discussion for me! On Sunday, seemingly out of the blue, my son (11) said he wanted to build a battle bot. Turns out, he&#39;d seen a video clip on the Internet from the old BattleBots TV show that ran in the US about 10 years ago. And that was all the inspiration he needed ... lol. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d bought my kids the older Lego Mindstorms kit, with the yellow RCX brick (the current one is called NXT), off of CraigsList two or three years ago. Even though they wanted it and were excited to have it, they played with it for about two nights and then that was it. <br/>
<br/>
So we brought that set out and my son has been playing with it every day since then. He actually saw a friend&#39;s NXT robot yesterday and initially thought he wanted that one instead. It&#39;s newer, can handle one more sensor, has a sound sensor, etc., but after really looking at it, he decided he likes his older kit better. The reason is that there is a lot more building that *has* to be done with the older kit. Even the simplest sample robot requires a fair amount of Lego building. The RCX kit really is a Lego kit, with a robotic brain and sensors added on. The NXT kit is more like a robotic brain and sensor kit, with a smallish number Lego Technics parts added on. My son likes the building part and thinks that the NXT kit doesn&#39;t allow you to do enough of that. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s true -- maybe you can extend things with your own Lego pieces -- but that&#39;s his perception.<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s goal is still to build a battle bot, so last night we ordered two used how-to-build-a-battle-robot books on Amazon. Today he plans to contact his friends and ask them if they want to build a battle bot with him and maybe find a competition to enter. In the meantime, his short-term plan is to build all the robots in the Lego advanced builder&#39;s kit (that we got when I bought the Mindstorms set), so he will understand how to build components that do different things. The robot he built the other night &quot;walks&quot; on a wire. That was pretty cool. <br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if he will stay interested enough in any of this to actually be able to build a battle bot. It will be quite a project, and we have a steep learning curve ahead of us, that&#39;s for sure. But for now he&#39;s excited and happy and we&#39;ll take it from there. <br/>
<br/>
In any case, I appreciate the original poster&#39;s question and all the replies. I&#39;m going to check out some of the resources people suggested. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Lori<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I should add that when I asked him how a particular gear assembly was working, he explained it to me and then added that he learned that info about gears from the PBS show Cyberchase. :-)<br/>
