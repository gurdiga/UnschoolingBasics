Actually we are Spiritualists. The only church that &quot;allows&quot; us a space<br/>
to hold our conventions is the Universalist church in our state capitol.<br/>
Spiritualists believe in life after death, spirit communication (which<br/>
my family and I practice), and &quot;do unto others as you would have them do<br/>
unto you.&quot;<br/>
&quot;T&quot; now has two therapists. He works with a group he is teaching him<br/>
social skills 4 afternoons a week. This group would like to see him get<br/>
therapy around his sexual identity issues. He is not a feminine acting<br/>
boy, except when he dresses feminine. He has a crush on a girl at<br/>
school. He is almost 9. I am so happy for him, that people are enabling<br/>
him to explore his life without harrassment, punishment, degradation,<br/>
etc. I take the unschooling stance that he is who he is and this is<br/>
worth exploring. When we take one persons right to be who they are away,<br/>
we take everyones rights away. I have been learning also, which is good.<br/>
I used to think crossdressing had something to do with a persons<br/>
sexuality and learned that it doesn&#39;t, etc. He is still young enough<br/>
where he can be sheltered from the masses. Eventually - I think when he<br/>
is a teenager - he may want to wear female clothing in public. He<br/>
already asks if he can grow his hair out long or wear a dress outside.<br/>
I said yes to the hair, no to the dress. <br/>
A young man from our state made headline news across the nation wearing<br/>
a dress to school a couple of years ago. When I was at Costco two weeks<br/>
ago I over heard a mother and son having a conversation. He seemed about<br/>
13 years old. I heard his mother say, &quot;We just moved to a new town, you<br/>
are in a new school, let&#39;s not start that...&quot; He was looking at female<br/>
Halloween costumes. Sad that we tell people not to be who they are out<br/>
of fear. On some level, it is necessary though. Michele<br/>
