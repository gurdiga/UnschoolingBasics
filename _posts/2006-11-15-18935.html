<div id="ygrps-yiv-257889120">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I have just recently decided to go with my gut and to NOT put my son <br/>
and daughter in tradtional school, private or public. They are only <br/>
three and 1/2 and two respectively, but Kindergarten was looming on <br/>
the horizon for my son and I didn&#39;t really grasp how much I was <br/>
dreading the intrusion on our lives untill I decided, once and for <br/>
all, to go with my gut and not to bow down to the wishes of the main-<br/>
stream and send him into the Quick Sand Muck (thanks to another post <br/>
for that description of school). My son is very sensitive and <br/>
somewhat speech delayed and I just know that sending him to school <br/>
would crush his spirit beyond repair. I know I have a &#39;row to hoe&#39; <br/>
with my In-Laws (and other relatives/friends) when I break the news <br/>
that I won&#39;t be sending him to school, but I&#39;ve dealt with thier <br/>
obvious disagreement in how I am raising my children on other fronts <br/>
already and so I am resigned to just do the &quot;Thanks for your <br/>
concern, we&#39;re doing fine&quot; line on this as well. I&#39;d honestly never <br/>
heard of the Unschooling ideaology untill very recently, but I am <br/>
very intrigued by it. I had it in my mind that I would need to <br/>
follow a curriculum, involving tests and workbooks and textbooks <br/>
etc... But I am very interested in the &#39;learning from life&#39; idea. I <br/>
am a bit nervous about it though. How do I ascertain and make sure <br/>
my children will have a well rounded education. Is that a valid <br/>
concern? Those of you with experience in Unschooling, have you been <br/>
succesful in just letting your children take the lead and let you <br/>
know what they want to learn? Do you &#39;create interest&#39; by just <br/>
putting out the books and materials and letting them pursue what <br/>
interests them from that? I have a HUGE library of books in my house <br/>
already, not text books naturally, but shelves of biographies, <br/>
NUMEROUS&#39;fact&#39; type books about all sorts of things (science, <br/>
history, animals etc), novels (classics and contemporary fiction) <br/>
etc etc etc, and of course tons of childrens books... Is this enough <br/>
to implement Unschooling? Can it all be done with no &#39;traditional&#39; <br/>
text books? Sorry for all the questions, but I am a novice and new <br/>
to this whole concept. I suspect I&#39;ve been &#39;unschooling&#39; my children <br/>
all along, just by answering their questions when asked, providing <br/>
thought stimulating TV shows, music and toys... Is there more to it <br/>
than that? Any advice or information would be most appriciated. <br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
May I suggest spending some time reading some of the older threads. <br/>
There&#39;s a TON of information and a lot of answers to your questions <br/>
there. I think that would be a great place to start. :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-354814163">Heather,<br/>
  I am also new to Unschooling.  My advice to you would be to read as much about unschooling as you can.  Your children are very young yet, so just play with them and love them.  Your &quot;well rounded education&quot; comment stuck out at me.  I used to worry about that too.  Now I am not worried about a &quot;well rounded education&quot; at all now.........I&#39;ve completely scrapped that idea.  I&#39;m more concerned with them finding their own path and learning the things that are right for their own lives as individuals.  My girls are 6 & 8.  Right now I just want them to be free and happy, and they shock me on a daily basis what they know and what they are learning.  I let them take the lead.  They let me know the types of things they need to learn.  And somehow we manage to get all our states requirements in while at it.  <br/>
  Good Luck, I&#39;m sure other&#39;s will have better advice.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What they end up with will be a different definition of well rounded.<br/>
<br/>
School is about packages of facts and skills neatly separated into  <br/>
categories that are handed to the child.<br/>
<br/>
Real learning is about immersing yourself in the great mishmosh of  <br/>
facts and ideas and experiences that is life and then pulling some  <br/>
sense out of them. We&#39;re hardwired to make connections and pull  <br/>
patterns out of chaos. We crave to make sense of it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s  <br/>
so satisfying to figure out how to do something on our own and get  <br/>
those &quot;Ah-hah!&quot; moments :-) It might be figuring out how to get onto  <br/>
the next level in a video game. It might be pulling pattern out of a  <br/>
complex story line in a manga. It might be seeing how numbers are  <br/>
fluid and that, for instance, 8&#39;s don&#39;t have to stay 8&#39;s. They can  <br/>
transform into 10-2 and 4+4 and 2*4.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how it&#39;s natural to learn. It doesn&#39;t make sense. It seems  <br/>
totally inefficient, and yet it&#39;s how we&#39;re designed. It&#39;s not at all  <br/>
natural for us to have some one else make sense out of that chaos and  <br/>
try to feed it to us in some linear order. We need to see everything  <br/>
in context and play around with it to understand.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Those of you with experience in Unschooling, have you been<br/>
&gt; succesful in just letting your children take the lead and let you<br/>
&gt; know what they want to learn?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In a way it looks like that and in a way it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
When she was 3-6 she was passionate about dinosaurs and we read every  <br/>
kids&#39; book, watched every video and movie, bought lots of plastic  <br/>
dinosaurs. That&#39;s what most people picture when they think of  <br/>
children taking the lead.<br/>
<br/>
When she was 7-8, after spending 2 months in 2nd grade to try it out,  <br/>
she drew pages and pages and pages of giant colored asterisks. She  <br/>
called them snowflakes but they looked like asterisks. I have no clue  <br/>
what was going on during that time but whatever it was, she needed to  <br/>
do it. Towards the end she saw a stapler on the floor and drew an  <br/>
amazing likeness of it.<br/>
<br/>
When she was 8-9 she started drawing this comic book series about her  <br/>
alter-ego Avn the Cat. Pages and pages and pages. She played a lot of  <br/>
video games.<br/>
<br/>
When she was 10-11 she watched *a lot* of Nickelodeon and Cartoon  <br/>
Network. She didn&#39;t want to go places though she took a couple of art  <br/>
classes. She only wanted to play with one friend since that friend  <br/>
was the only one who would play the type of pretend she liked. She  <br/>
said she had writer&#39;s block. I don&#39;t know what was going on there  <br/>
either (though I&#39;ve heard a lot of unschooling parents say their kids  <br/>
were passionate about cartoons at that age..) It&#39;s a preteen shifting  <br/>
of world views and interests. It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s a holding  <br/>
patterns as they shift from kid interests to more mature interests.<br/>
<br/>
At 12 she started drawing her comics again. (And still going at 15.)<br/>
<br/>
She actually loaded some of her early stuff up at ComicGenesis:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://avnhisky.comicgenesis.com/d/20050617.html">http://avnhisky.comicgenesis.com/d/20050617.html</a><br/>
<br/>
(The story with those characters is still going on!)<br/>
<br/>
We also read a lot of picture books, mostly stories. We read and  <br/>
listened to on tape a lot of adult and young adult books like Harry  <br/>
Potter and Artemis Fowl. Then she discovered manga (Japanese comics)  <br/>
and we&#39;ve read a ton of those together. We also did a few other  <br/>
things, but what I&#39;ve written pretty much characterized what she was  <br/>
doing at the time.<br/>
<br/>
At 13 she decided to take the college statistics class her father  <br/>
teaches. Her test scores were always either highest or within  a few  <br/>
points of highest. But she did it because it was fun. That year she  <br/>
also decided to try the National Novel Writing Month challenge to  <br/>
write a 50,000 word novel in 30 days which she managed to do. Which  <br/>
she also did just because it was fun. (We&#39;re both half way through  <br/>
our third time at it right now.)<br/>
<br/>
None of the previous years look like they were leading up to anything  <br/>
resembling that. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But *no one else&#39;s* journey or destination is going to look anything  <br/>
like that. Most kids won&#39;t draw comics. Most kids won&#39;t take college  <br/>
classes at 13. Most kids&#39; unschooling is going to look a lot like  <br/>
playing with some trips and activities for fun with parents.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you &#39;create interest&#39; by just<br/>
&gt; putting out the books and materials and letting them pursue what<br/>
&gt; interests them from that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When we&#39;re transitioning from school-think, it&#39;s easy to get caught  <br/>
in the idea of trying to get certain information into them in  <br/>
whatever way possible. So the idea of strewing sounds like leaving  <br/>
things they&#39;d learn in school laying around for them to pick up, or  <br/>
taking them to fun ways to learn about things they would have learned  <br/>
through textbooks. Like leaving out books on butterflies and finding  <br/>
programs on Animal Planet for them that sound good for them and trips  <br/>
to history museums. Of course when they don&#39;t embrace them with  <br/>
enthusiasm we get worried!<br/>
<br/>
It might be Sandra Dodd who often suggests asking yourself if it&#39;s  <br/>
something you would do for a spouse or friend. If we see a book we  <br/>
think our spouse or a friend would really like, we might buy it or  <br/>
tell them about it. We&#39;d recommend movies they might like. We might  <br/>
point out a lecture or something they might find interesting.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with kids. We aren&#39;t trying to fill gaps in our spouses  <br/>
and friends. We&#39;re just passing on things they might like that they  <br/>
may not have heard of.<br/>
<br/>
WIth kids we just need to ramp it up. They aren&#39;t likely to be  <br/>
combing the paper, and stumbling across things that sound intriguing.  <br/>
They&#39;re less likely to get intrigued about something that might  <br/>
interest them if they just don&#39;t know enough about it. A kid won&#39;t  <br/>
get all excited about a video about the Titanic if they don&#39;t know  <br/>
what the Titanic is!<br/>
<br/>
It might also be helpful to let go of any emotional investment you  <br/>
might have in something you put down for them. Treat everything you  <br/>
strew as<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have a HUGE library of books in my house<br/>
&gt; already, not text books naturally, but shelves of biographies,<br/>
&gt; NUMEROUS&#39;fact&#39; type books about all sorts of things (science,<br/>
&gt; history, animals etc), novels (classics and contemporary fiction)<br/>
&gt; etc etc etc, and of course tons of childrens books... Is this enough<br/>
&gt; to implement Unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought so. But honestly a lot of the books I bought have gone  <br/>
unread. We read tons of picture books and it was great owning her  <br/>
favorites that were read over and over. But if I had to do it over  <br/>
again, I would cut way back on the books! (If I could ;-) They&#39;re  <br/>
hard to resist!)<br/>
<br/>
I think in the end spending an afternoon doing crafts, or riding in  <br/>
the car talking, or going for a walk exploring, or playing a video  <br/>
game, or sharing a favorite cartoon together, is what&#39;s more  <br/>
important. Making connections is more important than filling our  <br/>
heads full of information.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re so conditioned in this society to think of books as the key to  <br/>
knowledge that we unconsciously put everything else way down on the  <br/>
list. The truth is that books are just a convenient and cheap package  <br/>
for information and one person&#39;s ideas. There&#39;s nothing knowledge- <br/>
wise more special about a book than a conversation or a movie or trip  <br/>
to a pond. In fact, books are closer to school than to real life when  <br/>
you think about it. Books provide linear information the way schools  <br/>
do. Real life is about absorbing a 1000 different ideas and seeing  <br/>
the patterns and connections between them. That&#39;s the way we  <br/>
naturally learn.<br/>
<br/>
In no way shape or form should someone see that as a dislike of  <br/>
books. But it is putting books in a more realistic perspective. As  <br/>
far as learning goes books aren&#39;t more important or special than any  <br/>
other form of linear information (like a video or a lecture). Their  <br/>
importance lies only in what someone is getting from them. Nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can it all be done with no &#39;traditional&#39;<br/>
&gt; text books?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I could say &quot;Yes! Absolutely!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or I could confusingly say, &quot;It depends on the kid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I think it might be more telling to say there is no &quot;it&quot;. There  <br/>
is no standard process that unschooling families are doing with their  <br/>
kids. For curriculum users, the process looks the same with slight  <br/>
variations: kids at the kitchen table reading from textbooks. Maybe  <br/>
they might read their texts on the couch. Or really progressive  <br/>
curriculum users might let them do it on the floor! ;-) But really  <br/>
the process is the same. Even with eclectic homeschooling, all the  <br/>
kids are doing something that looks like science or literature or math.<br/>
<br/>
But for unschoolers, unschooling looks like summer vacation with  <br/>
parents who like to play too. :-) And, while *the philosophy* is the  <br/>
same for unschooling families, how  it&#39;s put into practice will look  <br/>
totally different. For some it might be a lot of going places. For  <br/>
some it might be a lot of classes (dance and art and so forth). For  <br/>
some it might be a lot of play dates. For some it might be a lot of  <br/>
television and video games. For most families it will probably look  <br/>
like a little of each of those.<br/>
<br/>
It really depends on what a child enjoys. Some kids like textbooks  <br/>
and workbooks and might use them in a fairly standard way. For some  <br/>
kids there&#39;s a certain satisfying sense of &quot;Here&#39;s a complete chunk  <br/>
of knowledge with a distinct beginning, end and goal.&quot; But there&#39;s  <br/>
nothing better about that than playing video games. What&#39;s important  <br/>
is freely exploring the world in a way the child finds fun and  <br/>
satisfying.<br/>
<br/>
So, a quick answer to your question is, there&#39;s no need to make (or  <br/>
cajole or bribe or whatever) a child [to] use a textbook for them to  <br/>
explore life and find the things they enjoy before they&#39;re ready to  <br/>
move on in the world.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s it! Unschooling is precisely what a lot of parents do naturally<br/>
until their kids get to &quot;school age&quot; and then for some reason (social<br/>
training mostly) they feel that passing that particular date on the<br/>
calendar means they have to do something different with textbooks,<br/>
sitting and doing workbooks, etc. instead of continuing to live, love,<br/>
and explore the world together. My DS is 8 and has never been schooled,<br/>
nary a text or workbook in sight. Oh wait, I take that back, there are a<br/>
few preschooly type color and count type things around that were gifts<br/>
from relatives. We treated them the same as a coloring book or game or<br/>
toy - to be used when and how and how long he wanted. If he wanted to<br/>
just open to a random page and color the pictures instead of counting<br/>
the bunnies and apples, fine. If he asked &quot;what do the instructions<br/>
say?&quot; we&#39;d go ahead and read them - then he could choose whether to do<br/>
that or do something different with it. And we do have a couple &quot;guides&quot;<br/>
for cursive writing - about a year or two ago, he wanted to learn to<br/>
write his name in script after seeing me signing checks one day. So, I<br/>
did a bit with him and he asked for more. We talked a bit and decided<br/>
that checking the bookstore might be good - we picked out two guide<br/>
things (how to form the letters and connect them up with lots of arrows<br/>
and dotted lines) and took them home. After about 20-30 minutes, he had<br/>
had all he wanted of it for the time so we put them on a shelf for<br/>
whenever it comes around again, if it comes around again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829547833">I really like your answer.  <br/>
<br/>
I am still, also, new to the educational concept of unschooling vs homeschooling.  We tried the &#39;homeschooling&#39; when we first pulled my son out just about a year ago, half way through 2nd grade, and it was a real pain in the butt.  <br/>
<br/>
When my MIL had a stroke last Feb., and we had to race up to Ga, to be with her, we packed up the books and took them along.  I came home to prepare things for my MIL to move in and left my spouse and son there with MIL.  When they came home, there were no books.  The school books remained in GA.<br/>
<br/>
This past week as I was packing for a return trip to MIL&#39;s house to prepare it for winter, my son informed me that he had intentionally hid the books from dad so he wouldn&#39;t need to do the &#39;schoolwork&#39;. Lol, such a devious little mind.  He spent the spring and summer reading whatever he wanted, playing video and computer games he liked and just plain enjoying life and our farm.<br/>
<br/>
Come August when the public school started, I tried once again to get him on track with a curriculum.  What a miserable time we had of it.  He didn&#39;t want to sit and &#39;do school&#39;.  I didn&#39;t want my days like that either.  Besides, it turns out he knew most of the material for third grade already!  From all his reading, he knew sentence structure and phrasing and had an extensive vocabulary.  I asked him to read his third grade science book.  He loved it but wanted to just read it cover to cover not in &#39;lesson&#39; style of two pages a day.<br/>
<br/>
I figured why not.  After he finished, he informed me he already knew what they covered and more just from watching his favorite channel, Animal Planet and The Most Extreme.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to say I have the total concept of &#39;unschooling&#39; down.  It&#39;s nearing the time to do our first required evaluation and as I was gathering his work to present to the evaluator, I started getting really nervous.  Then I looked at his stuff from a year ago and his recent stuff.   He has grown by leaps and bounds.  Without penmanship lessons, his writing has improved wonderfully.  He has taught himself to type by writing his stories on his blog page.  <br/>
<br/>
This past year proves to me that children (or at least mine) will learn and explore more when just given the room to do it.  This group really helps keep things in perspective.<br/>

Thank you so much for your lengthy and interesting post reply!! I <br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve understood unschooling nearly as much untill I read <br/>
your comments on it. I appriciate so much the time you gave each of <br/>
my questions and the thoroughness (is that a word? Ha!) of each of <br/>
your answers! I plan to visti both the sites you recommended and <br/>
hope to write you a more lengthy reply myself soon... Have quite a <br/>
few more responses to read just now, and then dinner to make, but <br/>
hopefully a bit more face time w/ the computer will present itself <br/>
soon. I couldn&#39;t go on to any of that though untill I told you thank <br/>
you and wished you a lovely day!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585583314">Hi! I&#39;m new to unschooling. Like you, I thought I was going to get a curriculum and we were going to sit down and do lessons. We did well through about 20 lessons and then my six year old went &#39;on strike&#39;. Although I don&#39;t mind to &#39;make&#39; him do something, I wanted him to want to learn on his own. So, I guess we&#39;re unschooling. And now we&#39;re both learning!

I really like your answer.  <br/>
<br/>
I am still, also, new to the educational concept of unschooling vs homeschooling.  We tried the &#39;homeschooling&#39; when we first pulled my son out just about a year ago, half way through 2nd grade, and it was a real pain in the butt.<br/>

Treat everything you strew as though it were cartoons. It would be  <br/>

system?  Some rural libraries offer interlibrary loan for free as long<br/>
as the book you are requesting is in the county/city/district system.<br/>
You may be limiting yourself without need.  :)<br/>
<br/>
As for 6 hours of instruction a day, can you truly go 6 hours without<br/>
learning anything?  Every moment of every day is a day of learning in<br/>
the life of an unschooler.  I&#39;m presuming your child is awake for more<br/>
than 6 hours each day.  :-)  There I just solved your delimna of how<br/>
to meet six hours of education (doesn&#39;t say instruction).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963746603">Include recess, bathroom breaks, snacks, and lunch too.......those things are counted in the six hours kids are at PS.  Really if you condensed down (take out the interruptions, breaks, lunch, etc.) the actually time a child is getting instruction or doing academics in PS it would be nowhere near 6 hours.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034168934">Well that&#39;s pretty easy since he&#39;s awake probably 12 to 14 hours per<br/>
day. And *every* minute of that &quot;counts&quot; - reading the cereal box over<br/>
breakfast and discussing what &quot;cholesterol&quot; is &#39;counts&#39; as reading and<br/>
science at the very minimum, &quot;health&quot; or &quot;consumer health&quot; or whatever<br/>
if those categories need filling in where you are. That&#39;s probably 15-20<br/>
minutes right there. Running around in the yard or bouncing on the couch<br/>
are &quot;phys ed&quot; and that&#39;s probably at least an hour. If you take time in<br/>
the evening to read together, that &quot;counts&quot;. Playing computer and video<br/>
games &quot;counts&quot;. If you take a walk and spend 15 minutes counting how<br/>
many worms you see because it just rained, that &quot;counts&quot; - phys ed,<br/>
science, math. And so on. That &quot;6 hours&quot; is not necessarily 6 contiguous<br/>
hours of sitting and doing bookwork. And, too, what kind of reporting is<br/>
legally required? From a summary I looked at, you &quot;maintain&quot; attendance<br/>
(Are you here? Yes, Momma) and &quot;scholarship reports&quot; - check into it.<br/>
Most states that use &quot;maintain&quot; mean you keep a journal or log of some<br/>
form (or a portfolio or a scrapbook or whatever) and IF someone asks to<br/>
see it, you show it to them; if no one asks, it just stays in a drawer.<br/>
Mostly it can mean that you keep a log and then IF asked, you translate<br/>
it into &quot;school-ese&quot;, fitting things to expected categories &quot;subjects&quot;<br/>
and then send it in. <br/>
