<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517094701">I just wanted to share a little thing that happened this <br/>
morning. I was cutting up veggies for stew, our 6 yr old <br/>
son was watching me and I asked our son if he knew where the veggies <br/>
came from, he said our garden, I said thats right, we grew them all by <br/>
ourselves, he looked at me and said &quot;no we didn&#39;t&quot; I said &quot;yes we did&quot; <br/>
he said &quot;no mom, the rain and the sun helped us&quot;..then he said &quot;next <br/>
time remember, the rain and sun help veggies grow. Here I thought I was <br/>
teaching him something, but he was teaching me..<br/>

Thank you for letting me share,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-77386257">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
            Lately I have been having those darn thoughts about if <br/>
the kids are learning, I guess worring about it more because we are <br/>
moving to a new state that has more homeschool rules then where we <br/>
live now, and of course the dear MIL came to stay for a week and <br/>
thinks our 6yr son should know how to add double numbers and read on <br/>
his own. <br/>
<br/>
            But then the kids go and do things that make you say <br/>
YES,they are learning so much.... our DS 6 was walking through the <br/>
house counting by 10&#39;s, just for the fun of it and telling me all <br/>
about the guys on Lego Star Wars, even the little details of what <br/>
they are wearing. Then our DD 11 was talking over computer photo <br/>
programs with my husband. Saying that she is looking for one that <br/>
will give her better color and graphics when she edits photos, and <br/>
talking to us about her Video game, Phoenix Wright. Telling us every <br/>
detail of the court room and the crimes. <br/>
<br/>
