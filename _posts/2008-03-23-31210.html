&quot;Unconditional love - holding, nuzzling, and cuddling children for no reason<br/>

Freudians and behaviorists were united in their belief that highly<br/>
affectionate mothering damages children, and that scientific principles<br/>
could improve child rearing.  ...John Watson, the leading American<br/>
behaviorist (in the years before B. F. Skinner), published the<br/>
best-seller *Psychological<br/>
Care of Infant and Child*.  Watson wrote of his dream that one day babies<br/>
would be raised in baby farms, away from the corrupting influences of<br/>
parents.&quot;<br/>

When Harlow took the baby monkeys away from their mothers, it was to save<br/>
them from infections in the crowded lab.  But when those same monkeys were<br/>
reunited with other monkeys, they were stunned and unnerved.  They never<br/>
developed normally and became useless for experiments.  It took Harlow and<br/>
his students awhile to figure out that the babies NEEDED their mothers.  I&#39;m<br/>
glad they did &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573973812">I know. Or at least I sort of knew. I&#39;ve spent the last few hours reading a bunch about Harlow. My response was a very kneejerk response and as such it is interesting for me to examine. I&#39;m not comfortable with a lot of the later work that he did. Or really the early work. But, realizing that Bowlby recognized him as a saviour for attachment theory...that is really fascinating. It is fun to have my beliefs challenged. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443017635">Well, you probably know more about his work than I do &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
I just learned the bit that was in this book (the happiness hypothesis) I<br/>
