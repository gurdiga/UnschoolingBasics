<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821683429">Hello there :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a hard time discussing unschooling with my best friend  <br/>
(who just finished her training to become a teacher in public  <br/>
schools :-D). I&#39;m so new to unschooling that I cannot answer all the  <br/>
questions or argue against waht she says, even though I jsut &quot;feel&quot;  <br/>
that unschooling is &quot;right&quot;. Don&#39;t tell me I should not go out there  <br/>
to convince people, I&#39;m not, we&#39;re just discussing and soemtimes she  <br/>
says something and I feel, hmmmm yeah, hm, I really don&#39;t know, I  <br/>
wonder waht unschoolers would do in these situations. So I have to  <br/>
ask you.<br/>
<br/>
So first, I said that unschoolers wouldn&#39;t restrict TV, and also not  <br/>
the kind of programs. I have asked here how come they don&#39;t even  <br/>
restrict the kind of programs, for there ARE programs which aren&#39;t  <br/>
good for children (pornos, horror, war etc, she brought up a  <br/>
hitchcock movie she saw when she was 6 (the birds or soemthing) and  <br/>
how she was afraid of birds for her whole childhood and had  <br/>
nightmares and so on), and got good answers that helped me understand.<br/>
<br/>
I said that unschoolers don&#39;t expect their children to even want to  <br/>
watch these kind of movies and they would prpbably trust the parents  <br/>
if they told them as a friend that movie x was going to scare them,  <br/>
because the child has ideally never been as disappointed by its  <br/>
parents as schooled children who raised with coercive methods. And if  <br/>
they wanted to so badly we&#39;d talk about it and I&#39;d explain my worries  <br/>
and if she still wanted to watch I&#39;d watch whith her etc.<br/>
<br/>
Well, she said that NOW at 7 they wouldn&#39;t want to watch those things  <br/>
but in a few years... she said just like an adult would still be  <br/>
curious even if their husband/wife would tell them kindly not to  <br/>
watch something because X, they would probably still want to watch  <br/>
it, accepting the consequences which a child couldn&#39;t forsee. An  <br/>
adult could handle the consequences (fear, nightmares) better, but  <br/>
children couldn&#39;t and she said there have been research where they  <br/>
showed children agressive movies and then someone would hit the  <br/>
child, and those children who watched agressive movies reacted way  <br/>
more agressive than the others who hadn&#39;t. So her point was, it is  <br/>
proven to be damaging if they watch such things. And she doesn&#39;t  <br/>
believe they wouldn&#39;t watch it just because their parents tell them –  <br/>
and because I said that I would be watching with her if she wanted to  <br/>
watch something &quot;dangerous&quot;, she said that was quite time consuming  <br/>
and if would I sit next to her each time at each hour in the day  <br/>
whenever she wants to watch something, would I be advising her each  <br/>
time if she should be watching X or Y? I guess I wouldn&#39;t want to,  <br/>
and I cannot be 100% each minute with her. Is the only answer to this  <br/>
that unschooled children aren&#39;t interssed in TV so much anyway  <br/>
because of all the strewing we do? *scratch.head*<br/>
<br/>
Ok and then she came with other examples where she says it is  <br/>
impossible to not use any coercive methods and she quite got me  <br/>
there, I dunno what I would do especially with very young children  <br/>
when you can&#39;t even explain so much. So one example was her son who  <br/>
is 3, they were at the beach and he didn&#39;t want to neither use sun  <br/>
blocking cream nor use a hat, and absolutely refused it no matter  <br/>
what they explained (which they kindly did). Then they said they had  <br/>
to go home – they went into the car, there he promised to use the  <br/>
hat. He used it for 5 Minutes and again he refused to use it – same  <br/>
procedure, car, promise to use it, and then it worked for only THAT  <br/>
day, and the other older child was pissed off because she did use the  <br/>
cream but still was kind of punished (or would have been), if they  <br/>
would have had to go home. Then she told me they met a family with  <br/>
the same problem BUT, their son even had a sun allergy (or whatever  <br/>
illness so he really couldn&#39;t be in the sun). So it didn&#39;t work out  <br/>
very well with the coercive method either, but with letting him with  <br/>
no suncream it would have burned his skin. So she asks sarcastically,  <br/>
would I let my son &quot;burn&quot;, until he &quot;learns&quot;, what would the  <br/>
unschooling parent do? and it&#39;s kind of mean to say, well then burn  <br/>
from the sun, you&#39;ll see, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
She says they DO NOT learn from experience, for this thesis she had  <br/>
another example was that her son had hurt herself on his knee so he  <br/>
got a plaster. When the wound was healed, they tried to convince him  <br/>
to put it off, but he refused. They explained it could inflame and  <br/>
get worse and that it was really healed and so on but he refused. So  <br/>
they even let it there (&quot;unschooling&quot;) – and it did inflame and got  <br/>
worse, it hurt him and everything, but he still didn&#39;t learn! the  <br/>
next time he had a plaster was the same drama, so what would the  <br/>
unschooling parent do? if this is a safety issue I guess we would be  <br/>
&quot;allowed&quot; to enforce it and just rip the plaster off, at least the  <br/>
second time it happens? BUt then, wouldn&#39;t we be allowed to switch  <br/>
off TV after the second scary movie, if the first one made her have  <br/>
nightmares and she still didn&#39;t learn?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I want to convince MY FRIEND, it&#39;s just that I really  <br/>
don&#39;t know how *I* would handle this and I have a son who is 1 now,  <br/>
soon those kind of issues will arise, I guess. My daughter is 7, with  <br/>
her I can reason and since we are unschooling she is really  <br/>
reasonable and she really trusts me what I say and we haven&#39;t had  <br/>
these kinds of arguments (I&#39;m waiting though, it&#39;s just been 3  <br/>
weeks...), but with a toddler?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-502599173">Hi Johanna,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still a newbie to unschooling as well, but the underlying theme in <br/>
this conversation with your friend is that she parents in an &quot;either/or&quot; <br/>
situation, whereas unschoolers parent in a &quot;multiple choice, multiple <br/>
answer&quot; way (to make it sound more schooly).  Regarding the <br/>
sunscreen/hat issue with the 3yo, his only options were to put the <br/>
sunscreen/hat on or go home.  Unschoolers would have found a way to make <br/>
putting on sunscreen fun, used spray on or colored sunscreen, bought a <br/>
sunblocking bathing suit that covers the whole body, would have only <br/>
gone out in the sun before 10am or after 3 or 4pm, or a whole host of <br/>
other options.  A 3yo isn&#39;t going to understand any type of explanation <br/>
about sunscreen and what it does.  But if mommy says, &quot;Chris, can you <br/>
help mommy put on her sunscreen?&quot; and she lets him help to put it on <br/>
her, then he sees that it&#39;s fun to squeeze out of the bottle and rub <br/>
into the skin.  Then, he may just want to put it on himself, and she can <br/>
help with making sure it does get on all the right places.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not about &quot;do it my way or it&#39;s the highway,&quot; like <br/>
traditional parenting dictates.  It&#39;s more about exploring all the <br/>
different solutions and finding the ones that work best with your <br/>
family/child.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get some really good responses from the seasoned members <br/>
of the list and I look forward to reading them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You seem kind of hostile towards unschoolers. Am I reading this wrong? No one here has said &quot;my way or the highway.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Do people on an unschooling list think that they have the best way for their kids to live and learn? Well, yeah. Of course I&#39;m doing what I think is best for my family. Don&#39;t you? <br/>
<br/>
Just because someone is confident doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re telling you to get lost or change your own ways. You&#39;re free to live with your family as it works best for you. That&#39;s a given.<br/>
<br/>
I hope we can get back to unschooling/parenting discussions now. This seems to be veering off into the meta-discussion zone. :o)<br/>

is most likely an antecdotal study at best.  My brother grew up loving<br/>
very violent movies (not just horror, but movies where there was lots<br/>
of shooting, slashing with knives, criminal behaviour) and yet he is<br/>
one of the most gentle and peaceful people that I know.  There are<br/>
several families on this list who have children who are very into what<br/>
would be considered violent video games, yet they are truly gentle<br/>
souls.<br/>

been unschooled, who have not built up trust with their parents and<br/>
whose parents place their time as more important than their<br/>
children&#39;s.  Can I be with my children 100% of the time?  No.  I do<br/>
have to pee and bathe and go to work.  Yet I do know that if my child<br/>
has a need of me to be there for them I will.  And that includes<br/>
watching a movie that their friends have seen, but that they are<br/>
concerned that might frighten them or make them otherwise<br/>
uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard for people who are unfamiliar with unschooling and how have<br/>
grown  up being taught coercive measures to think in non-coercive<br/>
terms.  We are a society that has learned well how to make other<br/>
people do what we want them to (or what we wouldn&#39;t want to do<br/>
ourselves!!)  We can&#39;t think of ways to get what needs to be done (by<br/>
others and ourselves!) without coercion of some sort.<br/>

what it was and I didn&#39;t remember well when I quoted it either. I  <br/>
just looked, what she said was &quot;and after they had seen the  <br/>
(agressive) movie, they&#39;d take away something of the child  <br/>
agressively or hit them or something&quot;, So I dunno exactly what it was  <br/>
they did and she didn&#39;t either she just remembered their reaction was  <br/>
more aggressive than the reaction of the children who had seen  <br/>
peaceful movies.<br/>

But actually after thinking about what you guys have been saying, I  <br/>
realize that such studies don&#39;t really say anything, especially  <br/>
because they are never done with unschooled children.<br/>

Are there any studies with unschooled children, btw.? I know that you  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>And what would we use as a control group?  If we were to do studies on<br/>
unschoolers we would need a control group.  I don&#39;t see traditionally<br/>
schooled children as a fair control group.  Would we compare them to<br/>
traditionally homeschooled children?  Children left in a box for 18<br/>
years?  What we can do is look at &quot;reports&quot; from parents of unschooled<br/>
children.  We can look at individual reports from these parents.<br/>
Though biased, they would speak better than trying to do some sort of<br/>
controlled study.<br/>
<br/>
Where can we read such reports?  Here to start with.  At<br/>
sandradodd.com for another.  Several unschooling magazines and even<br/>
unschooling blogs.  I think one reason that most unschoolers see their<br/>
children as &quot;successful&quot; is because they have redefined what success<br/>
is.  It isn&#39;t going to an Ivy league college, winning a Rhodes<br/>
scholarship, becoming a well-paid defense attorney (or vascular<br/>
surgeon) *unless* those are the goals of that child.  I&#39;ve read<br/>
&quot;reports&quot; from unshcooling moms who were just as proud of their<br/>
children who chose to live homeless for a period of time as I have<br/>
from unschooling moms whose children have gone on to more<br/>
traditionally looking careers.<br/>
<br/>
Studies schmudies.  Who needs them?  I don&#39;t.  :)<br/>

&gt; Are there any studies with unschooled children, btw.? I know that you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t need any proves like the results of such studies, but I think<br/>
&gt; it would still be interesting and easier for us to do what we do if<br/>
&gt; our environment could be informed through their so much valued<br/>
&gt; &quot;studies&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The deal IS:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Which one of you would volunteer *your* child for such a study?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I doubt we&#39;ll ever see many (any???) studies down on unschooled kids.<br/>

<br/>
 Yeah but...<br/>
<br/>
  I think the studies people *want* are the studies done on school-AGED <br/>
children. And I will NOT submit Duncan to that. If I wanted him tested <br/>
and graded, I&#39;d put him in school! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Cameron (he&#39;s mine &lt;g&gt;) would be happy to be interviewed, but at 18 is <br/>
no longer a &quot;child&quot;---and I don&#39;t think there are many schooled adults <br/>
who would have all *that* much negative to say about themselves or <br/>
their childhood either. We *all* would like to believe that the <br/>
childhood we endured/survived was the best we could have had. Many <br/>
things often look blurry through adult eyes! &lt;g&gt; That&#39;s why people <br/>
don&#39;t make the necessary changes to be a better parent than their own <br/>
parents were. I mean...THEY turned out OK, right?<br/>
<br/>
  AND I think that if it were a pro-unschooling study (meaning a <br/>
supporter of unschooling was doing the study) that it would be taken as <br/>
self-serving publicity at most and plain stupid/reckless at the very <br/>
least. I think it would be rather hard to find a truly unbiased <br/>
interviewer/studier/sociologist/scientist. Plus, if we changed the mind <br/>
of the scientist/sociologist/whomever, it would no longer looked <br/>
unbiased.<br/>
<br/>
  Schooling and parenting aee HUGELY personal---just check out your <br/>
*own* friendships since you&#39;ve chosen unschooling/gentle parenting! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
One of the big reasons the conference is so powerful is that you&#39;re <br/>
surrounded by other parents who actually GET it and LIVE it! Close, <br/>
immediate friendships are formed due to the common parenting and <br/>
educational ideas. Kind of freaky, really! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Cameron&#39;s more than happy to &quot;evangelize&quot; with me! &lt;g&gt; Duncan will <br/>
too. But I won&#39;t subject him to the same things we&#39;re avoiding by not <br/>
sending him to school.<br/>
<br/>
  I think their contributions will be made in the same way the are <br/>
now---one person at a time---WHEN that person is ready.<br/>

&gt; would I let my son &quot;burn&quot;, until he &quot;learns&quot;, what would the  <br/>
&gt; unschooling parent do? and it&#39;s kind of mean to say, well then burn  <br/>
&gt; from the sun, you&#39;ll see, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*** I have been thinking about these scenarios she has presented with<br/>
you and I think she is missing the point of unschooling.   Which is<br/>
common.<br/>
<br/>
Traditional parenting is all about force, control and &quot;making&quot; kids do<br/>
things by use of punishments/rewards.  The parents decide, the child<br/>
obeys.  This goes on all day long, day in and day out.  The children<br/>
have little or no real control over their life.  They may be allowed<br/>
to have pseudo-choices such as &quot;You can wear the red jacket or the<br/>
blue jacket but you WILL wear a jacket.&quot;  (or my favorite, &quot;You can<br/>
eat all your veggies or you can get a spanking&quot;) But other than that<br/>
their days consist of being bossed around by the parent or other adult<br/>
authority figures. <br/>
<br/>
What this creates in the child is a strong opposition or counterwill<br/>
in order to maintain their sense of self. It is this dynamic that for<br/>
the most part is missing in unschooled children.  And it is this<br/>
dynamic that makes it difficult for traditionally parenting families<br/>
to find solutions other than using coercive methods. In the sunscreen<br/>
case, counterwill would make finding a solution near impossible simply<br/>
because the issue is not about sunscreen but about the child asserting<br/>
his automony.  And since the parent will not let the child be<br/>
autonomous, there really is no solution.  The parent and child will<br/>
clash and whoever is more forceful will prevail.  Even if the parent<br/>
offers alternatives, such as a T-shirt, the child will still say no<br/>
because the child is using this as an opportunity to deliberately<br/>
oppose the parent. <br/>
<br/>
This type of incident occurs because the entire relationship is based<br/>
on control and force.  Parents and children who unschool base their<br/>
relationship on love and respect.  When children are not being forced<br/>
to do things, counterwill is not triggered in the child.  When<br/>
children are treated with respect, solutions can be reached. <br/>
Unschooling parents strive to not make demands or issue orders to<br/>
their children.  Despite the fact that we are bigger and stronger than<br/>
our children, we try our best to not use this force to get our own<br/>
way.  Our children relish their automony and respect us because we<br/>
respect them.  And they call us on it when we are using force with<br/>
them and we apologize!  <br/>
<br/>
What this creates is a wonderful, joyous, loving climate in which<br/>
solutions can be found.  It also simplifies the problem.  An<br/>
unschooling family struggling with finding a solution to sun burn is<br/>
just dealing with that - the sun burn.  Optimally, they are not<br/>
struggling with the whole force/control/counterwill issue that a<br/>
traditional family would be dealing with.  So the child really can<br/>
just make a choice.  He doesn&#39;t have to choose not to put on sunscreen<br/>
 as a way to assert his will as opposite to his mother&#39;s.  He can<br/>
choose to put it on just because it would be a smart thing to do.  And<br/>
he can choose to not put it on just because he really hates the feel<br/>
of it.  Mom probably has a preference but she isn&#39;t going to impose it<br/>
on him.  And she certainly isn&#39;t going to coerce him.<br/>
<br/>
So traditional parents always ask what boils down to the same<br/>
either/or question:  Either you make your child do (whatever) or you<br/>
let them kill/hurt/maim/burn themselves.  In their reality, that is<br/>
all they know.  There is no other choice.  And really, I think, it is<br/>
probably true.  For a parent and child locked in a battle of wills,<br/>
there is only  one winner and one loser.  You either force them or let<br/>
them hurt themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
But as far as either/or goes, unschoolers will answer that question as<br/>
&quot;neither&quot; because our reality is entirely different. I will neither<br/>
force them nor will I &quot;let&quot; them kill themselves.  What I will do is<br/>
work with them, in an attitude of mutual respect, to find a solution<br/>
that is acceptable to all.  And because I treat my child with respect<br/>
all the time - not just in this single instance - he will work with me<br/>
to find that solution and not have to exert all his energy opposing<br/>
me.  We both win because we are not fighting each other, we are on the<br/>
same team working on a problem.  It is just a completely different<br/>
paradigm.<br/>
