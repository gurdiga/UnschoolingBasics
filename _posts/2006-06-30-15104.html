<div id="ygrps-yiv-952631300">~Conventionally parented kids *can* react with malice. They *can*<br/>
become angry with the world because it seems like no one understands<br/>
*them*.~<br/>
<br/>
Heck, mindfully parented kids can act/feel this way too! The<br/>
difference is, a mindful parent does not want to label their child as<br/>
having &quot;malice&quot; and therefore the child learns that they are<br/>
good/capable/whole and desirable.  Instead of learning to view their<br/>
actions as &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, they begin to pick up new tools. Instead<br/>
of seeing themselves as &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot; they feel true self-confidence<br/>
in spite of mistakes (or as Kelly calls them, learning takes).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to say that a mindfully parented child never feels<br/>
malice towards someone. But I think it&#39;s a really lame way to label<br/>
the behavior. I&#39;d rather say the child was angry for a reason (a<br/>
reason that may seem totally unreasonable to US, but we need to try<br/>
and understand that it&#39;s simply how they feel) and acted in a way that<br/>
seemed &quot;malicious&quot; or &quot;mean spirited&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Again, it&#39;s lack of tools or experience that caused the event to<br/>
unfold that way. Human beings really WANT to fit into their tribal<br/>
group. They WANT to understand their world, their peers and figure out<br/>
all the framework of society. Understanding that about them, will help<br/>
us be better guides. Assuming malice will not, even if the act seems<br/>
terribly wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860531699">_____  <br/>
<br/>
We have a family that lives behind us. The grandmother is raising the<br/>
children, 2 & 5. There are 8 adults living in the house also, sons and<br/>
daughters along with their husbands and wives. The children were playing<br/>
with my children a lot when we first moved in a couple of months ago. I<br/>
noticed behaviors that disturbed me a lot. The little boy (5) was calling my<br/>
dd (7) ugly names, hitting her, destroying her things, etc. My ds (9) was<br/>
ready to punch this kid out at any given moment (he is very protective of<br/>
his sister). But dd still wanted to play with him so our family talked about<br/>
it and decided that supervision was what was needed.  I told my children<br/>
that a child would not behave this way unless there was something very wrong<br/>
going on in their home. We decided to invite him over more often and try to<br/>
give him a safe place to be. Sure enough we started hearing the adults<br/>
fighting shortly after (I think they were on their good behavior when we<br/>
first moved in.) The screaming and cussing was terrible and would keep us up<br/>
at night. I would just cry for the children and soon my ds was too and saw<br/>
that I was right in my assumption. Then the little boy started killing<br/>
kittens (their place is crawling with cats.) He drowned one according to my<br/>
dd and threw one down the stairs. My dh saw him purposefully throw one in<br/>
front of one of their dogs and the dog tore it up while the child watched.<br/>
Then he picked up the kitten and ran to his grandmother and told her that<br/>
the dog had gotten a hold of one of the kittens but that he had saved it. My<br/>
dh went ballistic! I went out and got the child (before dh could get a hold<br/>
of him) and brought him to my house and sat him down. I started to talk to<br/>
him not knowing really what I was going to say. He fell into my lap and<br/>
cried for 30 minutes at least. When my dh came in to see how it was going he<br/>
found both of us on the floor crying our eyes out. I don&#39;t think I have ever<br/>
felt such pain before. I wanted to save him, to run away with, him but all I<br/>
could do was hold him and let him cry. When I told my dh and ds what had<br/>
happened they both started crying also (I think at the beginning they were<br/>
just humoring me most of the time when I was defending him.) I told him to<br/>
come over whenever he needed to and he did for awhile but just last Sunday<br/>
the grandmother called me chewed me out for something and won&#39;t let the<br/>
children come over anymore. In so many ways I am sorry she won&#39;t let them<br/>
come over anymore but my own children have been so much more peaceful this<br/>
week. This child is totally unable to deal with what the adults in his life<br/>
are doing to him. I know he was killing the cats on purpose, but there was<br/>
another reason behind his behavior. He wanted to hurt because he was hurting<br/>
and it is all he knows. He was venting his emotions the only way he could.<br/>
People don&#39;t do hurtful things for no reason. The reasons may not make sense<br/>
to us and the person may not be able to explain it but there is always a<br/>
reason for it.  I&#39;m so glad I saw his actions the way I did instead of<br/>
blaming him. He and I have a special relationship now. Hopefully soon<br/>
Grandma will get her head out of her butt and allow them over again. I loved<br/>
the way he looked so amazed when I would offer them a snack. He would look<br/>
up at me with his eyes so big and say, &quot;Really?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I better stop now before I start bawling again.<br/>

   <br/>
  At what point do you step in and call CPS?  <br/>
   <br/>
  I understand the point of the story. I understand that your house was a small ray of sunlight for these children.  Are you sure your house is enough sunlight? I&#39;d have been on the phone to CPS the first time I witnessed or my kids witnessed him killing the kittens.  There is something terribly wrong in that household!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-794831279">Actually CPS is very heavily involved over there. So is the Environmental<br/>
Protection Agency. They are working with the family but not doing a very<br/>
good job. The mother is only allowed over on weekends and is taking<br/>
parenting classes but the grandmother railroads her efforts constantly. The<br/>
fathers (2 different fathers, same mom) are working within the court system<br/>
to see the kids. One father has recently been taken back to court to stop<br/>
visitation when his new girlfriend was burning the little girl (2 years old)<br/>
purposely on her legs with cigarettes. The children are receiving<br/>
counseling. There are CPS workers over there every week or so. <br/>
<br/>
The Grandmother and the CPS workers believed that the incidences with the<br/>
kittens were accidents and when I tried to say something the Grandmother<br/>
then proceeded to tell me how rotten my dc were. She didn&#39;t want to hear any<br/>
of it. She is in total denial. When I told her that her grandson was calling<br/>
my dd a bitch she just laughed and said that he probably heard it at their<br/>
house. That word flies around a lot over there but It&#39;s a hot button for me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The children have an uncle that lives there, a good friend of ours, that<br/>
cares a great deal about the children and is very good to them. I think I<br/>
will talk to him soon and tell him what I see and try to see what can be<br/>
done. I just don&#39;t know what else to do. And now that I don&#39;t see the<br/>
children at all I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s gotten better or worse. She is terribly<br/>
angry with me and apparently with her whole family right now. <br/>

_This is a huge issue for us. We moved out here to the country 2 months ago.<br/>
Why?! Neighbors!!! We were sick of having neighbors! We came here for peace.<br/>
We DO NOT want to make enemies with the only neighbors we have! And she is<br/>
