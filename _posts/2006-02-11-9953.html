I can tell you one thing that really helped my dh in the early years<br/>
(this was before we really GOT unschooling though). Just knowing I had<br/>
activities planned and taking lotsa photos.<br/>
So the activities can be totally fun and not schoolish at all, but if<br/>
I planned some things each week and told him how much they learned, he<br/>
felt like something was getting &quot;accomplished&quot;.<br/>
