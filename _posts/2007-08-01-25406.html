<div id="ygrps-yiv-100358519">~~~limit the amount of time my kids watch TV and playcomputer games. *gasp* <br/>
<br/>
I had never even heard the word unschooling when my son was two.  My little son<br/>
showed an amazing amount of interest in airplanes. (Probably helped that we have<br/>
RC planes everywhere and our own runway.) So my spouse bought an very expensive<br/>
flight simulator for the computer for this child.  At two, he learned how to fly planes and<br/>
is rather good at it.  <br/>
<br/>
~~~mine will do nothing but play RuneScape all day if it&#39;s allowed<br/>
<br/>
When I heard of Runescape via this group, I introduced it to my family.  I now pay for<br/>
four members. (I&#39;m the biggest user. ; ) )  One of the interesting things that came out <br/>
of this game, was the kids asking (and us researching all the facts)  If things were <br/>
really made, caught, etc, as designed into the game.  We ended up learning a lot <br/>
about mining and glassblowing and such.  (Much I knew, but I never play the expert.<br/>
We always look things up so they get the current information, lol, I&#39;m old.)  I don&#39;t<br/>
set limits and have found that my kids bounce to all types of activities.  They have<br/>
no tv, computer, sports, eating, etc, addictions.  (I&#39;ll accept that my kids are special *grin* j/k)<br/>
<br/>
Guess I was RU before I heard the word!<br/>
