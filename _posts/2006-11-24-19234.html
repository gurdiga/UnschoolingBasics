<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031178008">That&#39;s true.  IMO, it was not at all that bad.  No, Dr. Phil didn&#39;t suddenly <br/>
decide it was a great idea, but I don&#39;t think he was completely closed <br/>
minded nor unfair.  It was actually somewhat of a debate, a rather unusual <br/>
thing on television these days.  I just didn&#39;t think it was at all worth <br/>
getting up in arms about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952171173">Apparently the polls on their shows close at the end of the day a show airs. <br/>
As of about 11:30pm last night, the results for Dr. Phil&#39;s poll on schooling <br/>
methods was:<br/>
<br/>
Which style of schooling do you think is best?<br/>
18%429Public school<br/>
12%331Private school<br/>
48%1269Homeschooling<br/>
22%586Unschooling<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141117925">Hi Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
Actually, in fairness, no I didn&#39;t. I read the blog by the person who<br/>
was there during the taping.  I know, I know, I should have waited to<br/>
draw my own conclusions first.  Having said that, I do feel healthy<br/>
discussion is good and that there is something positive about the<br/>
discussion even being had. I think the part that bothered me the most<br/>
was about the audience filling.  It makes it challenging to have a<br/>
balanced discussion when the moderators rig the balance of the audience.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also heard/read that based on the initial response to the<br/>
original format of the show, that the producers somehow toned it down<br/>
before it actually aired.  I don&#39;t know that to be true or not, but<br/>
the original airing was to have been October 27th and it was delayed<br/>
for whatever reason.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, my opinion is based on my own thoughts of Dr Phil himself. <br/>
Having a background in psychology and being a hypnotherapist myself, I<br/>
relate to him in perhaps a different way. I see that he often puts his<br/>
guests in a very defensive position and that is not helpful to anyone<br/>
in finding resolution to an issue.  <br/>
<br/>
So having said that, I do see that some good will come out of his<br/>
program in that the discussion is at least being had and that it has<br/>
come to the attention of many that homeschooling is becoming more and<br/>
more prevalent.  If I weren&#39;t already homeschooling, my question would<br/>
be WHY?  Why are so many choosing to homeschool now?  Could it be that<br/>
perhaps the system, such as it is now, no longer serves it&#39;s purpose<br/>
for the benefit and betterment of all?  I wouldn&#39;t pit homeschool vs<br/>
public school, I&#39;d find out why so many educated and rational people<br/>
are choosing to go this route.<br/>
<br/>
