 </span></blockquote>We had a pretty cool day today, my dd&#39;s and some friends of ours went to see <br/>
&quot;Sacred Space,&quot; by the Nrityagram (Nuh-REET-yah-grahm) Dance Ensemble today at <br/>
a local University. Nrityagram is the only dance village in the world, it <br/>
exists solely to preserve and popularize the 7 classical Indian dance styles and <br/>
2 martial dance arts. The mostly female dancers spend yrs. perfecting their <br/>
craft and technique. The ensemble is known primarily for it&#39;s commitment to <br/>
Odissi dance form. &quot;Scared Space&quot; is a presentation of 7 dance segments based on <br/>
Indian poetry and mythology, that aims to recreate an energy field or sacred <br/>
space through the Odissi dance tradition. What a beautiful dance! We all decided <br/>
that we felt like we were in a trance and &quot;in another place&quot; the whole time <br/>
while watching it. It was SO cool. <br/>
<br/>
We then went a few blocks over to an Indian restaurant for lunch (yummy!) and <br/>
came home and made some Masala Chai tea from a recipe they gave us and I <br/>
thought I would pass it on to all of you. (you may already have it or one like it, <br/>
I think I remember seeing a recipe here once, but I figured it wouldn&#39;t hurt <br/>
to share just the same!:o) <br/>
<br/>
Masala Chai<br/>
4 c. water<br/>
4 c whole milk<br/>
1/2 t. cardamom seeds<br/>
1/2 t. whole black peppercorns<br/>
1/2 t. whole cloves<br/>
1/2 cinnamon chips<br/>
1 star anise<br/>
1 whole nutmeg<br/>
1t. peeled & minced fresh ginger<br/>
1 Madagascar Bourbon vanilla bean, chopped fine<br/>
4 t. black tea leaves, strong, robust tea works best<br/>
8 oz grade &quot;A&quot; honey (I always use raw)<br/>
<br/>
Bring the water and milk to a boil in a scaucepot. Add the remaining <br/>
ingredients, except honey, turn the heat down to a simmer, cover and steep for 10-15 <br/>
min. Remove from heat and strain. (try using a coffee filter if needed) Add <br/>
honey and mix well. Store in refrigerator. Can be served hot or cold.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy it as much as we did! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Leslie, I was making a spaghetti sauce with boca ground, chopped tomatoes,<br/>
mushrooms, olives, zucchini, fresh rosemary, thyme, basil, garlic, and<br/>
oregano.  So according to our friend that&#39;s the smell of Ren&#39;s house.  I<br/>
associate her house with tea, though.  All kinds.  She always had tea going.<br/>

wonderful idea to have spaghetti for dinner tomorrow night (after our <br/>
trip to the botanical gardens)with homemade sauce that Shareen, my dd, <br/>
