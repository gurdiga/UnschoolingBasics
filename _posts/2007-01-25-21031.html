<div id="ygrps-yiv-639128295">Hi Kimberly, <br/>
<br/>
First...you don&#39;t need to explain unschooling to the therapist. It&#39;s <br/>
not really any of her business. Second, know your state laws and <br/>
don&#39;t be intimidated with threats to call DCF. Third, is therapy <br/>
neccessary at this time? Can you take a vacation from it for a <br/>
while? Maybe go back when you have more confidence in unschooling? <br/>
If not, you may have to intervene when your child is questioned <br/>
about &quot;school&quot;. Be polite, give a quick standard type answer (Oh-we <br/>
do lots of fun stuff) and then change the subject. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My thoughts are: Why act as though you are accountable to this<br/>
therapist? I&#39;m assuming that you&#39;ve filed any necessary paperwork in<br/>
your state in order to homeschool legally. I&#39;m also assuming that this<br/>
lady is NOT in charge of that process, right? And finally, I&#39;m also<br/>
assuming that she is a guest and that you fully expect her to be<br/>
respectful of your decisions as a parent when she enters your private<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not sure why you need or would even volunteer to show her<br/>
&quot;proof positive&quot; of what you&#39;ve been doing, unless talking with her<br/>
about their learning progress is somehow beneficial to the therapy. If<br/>
it is, then you might want to say you&#39;re going to be doing things a<br/>
bit differently and you won&#39;t have worksheets and kill & drill pages<br/>
to show her, but that if she works with the children long enough<br/>
she&#39;ll be able to see progress for herself. IMO, reviewing tests and<br/>
worksheets as a way of evaluating kids is *very* lazy. If you spend<br/>
enough time around a kid, or even work with them regularly like your<br/>
therapist does, you&#39;ll know if there is progress or not if you just<br/>
pay attention.<br/>
<br/>
I realize this probably isn&#39;t the answer you&#39;re looking for and I<br/>
understand how easy it is to be fearful, but if you project confidence<br/>
in your decisions, command a certain level of respect from everyone<br/>
who enters your home, and establish clear boundaries, it will much<br/>
less likely for you to be pushed around or threatened by someone who<br/>
thinks they know what&#39;s best for you & your children. You can explain<br/>
to the therapist that you very much appreciate her help and input<br/>
concerning their therapy, but you need to establish clear boundaries<br/>
wherein your parenting decisions, including the manner in which they<br/>
are schooled (or unschooled as the case may be) is *your* decision and<br/>
not hers, period, end of discussion.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is unfortunate. I&#39;m not sure what state you are in, but in VA we<br/>
are required to turn in &quot;evidence of progress&quot; each year through<br/>
testing or a portfolio review. I think the state would be hard pressed<br/>
to prove educational neglect if we are meeting that require each year.<br/>
There is no law in VA that prevents unschooling. We are allowed to<br/>
design our own curriculum and many of us write up our unschooling<br/>
experiences and forseeable plans in &quot;school speak&quot; (educational<br/>
language that the schools understand) and insert phrases such as<br/>
&quot;child-led&quot; and &quot;cooperative skill building&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that if my paperwork is in order and we&#39;re meeting the evidence<br/>
of progress each year, then we are in keeping with the law and it&#39;s<br/>
absolutely no one&#39;s business - including DCF or CPS - about *how* we<br/>
are accomplishing that or what our day-to-day routine looks like. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t hesitate to look someone in the eye and say just that.<br/>

  What kind of therapist and why is she coming to your home weekly?  Is having this person in your home really serving your children&#39;s needs in the best way possible?  <br/>
   <br/>
  As to being reported to child services, find out what the homeschooling laws in your state require of you.  Testing? Documentation? Registration?   You can find info at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nhen.org">http://nhen.org</a> <br/>
   <br/>
  Once you&#39;re sure you&#39;re doing all that is required -- and I recommend doing only what&#39;s required by law, without offering any extra info or documentation (don&#39;t want them to get used to having more access they really have a right to) -- then if anyone does report you to the authorities, you&#39;ll have all you need to defend your rights.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639487897">If you are otherwise comfortable with this therapist, what about <br/>
saying something like &quot;I&#39;ve been researching independent-study <br/>
programs for children and think it is worth trying out.&quot; I don&#39;t get <br/>
into &quot;unschooling&quot; with most people - its waaaay to theoretical for <br/>
the most part. I focus on using words like independent and self-<br/>
directed - and combine them with words like amazing and impressive <br/>
such as: &quot;I&#39;m just so amazed at how self-directed Rayan is becoming. <br/>
He&#39;s really showing an impressive capability to problem solve now that <br/>
he&#39;s been given a bit more independance.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
You might want to check out some unschoolers blogs, too. That&#39;s a <br/>
method many people use as a form of record keeping. I also find it <br/>
helps the extended family make real conversation with the kids, and <br/>
not have to fall back on &quot;how&#39;s school?&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-357162890">Hi Kim, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you before, so welcome. I&#39;m not sure of ages or why you <br/>
have a therapist, but I have seven children, two of whom have life difficulties due to <br/>
autism.<br/>
<br/>
We have had various therapists in our lives (and our homes) due to our two oldest <br/>
children&#39;s issues, but we have never put up with one telling us how to run our lives. <br/>
Primarily they do not have the right, and secondarily, they will only be that intrusive if you <br/>
allow it. Remember that you are the consumer, and they are a paid service. I definitely <br/>
would not try to explain unschooling to her, much less try to justify my children&#39;s <br/>
activities. If she asks again, I would say &quot;I think it&#39;s more appropriate that we discuss what <br/>
you came here for, here are the problems we&#39;re having this week. This is how we&#39;re <br/>
handling it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The best way to protect yourself is to be aware of the laws in your state. Become educated <br/>
and firm in your standing. If someone threatens you, be able to state, &#39;According to statute <br/>
xyz, I have the right to educate my children in a manner that I see fit.&#39; Have the wording <br/>
from DCF that says that parents are only to be reported for x kind of neglect, and that <br/>
there is no proof of this. DCF will cause a temporary annoyance (if they even follow up on <br/>
this) and the therapist will get bad reviews from one side of your town to another. If she <br/>
knows you are not worried, then she&#39;ll think twice. Oh, i guess you could be nice and say <br/>
&quot;Thank you for your concern, but the law states that blahblahblah&quot; And you can always use <br/>
the &#39;pass the bean dip&#39; phrase. Basically finish the discussion instead of letting a debate <br/>
start, by changing the topic.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, you&#39;ll get lots of input from here, really great ones too. We did cut out a lot of <br/>
therapy, in light of unschooling it seemed ridiculous ;-) Our children have thrived without <br/>
it, and keeping positive people around you will make a big difference to your energy and <br/>
to your motivation. Again, welcome to the group.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413198162">Melissa...Thanks for the welcome.  As far as needing the therapist, I have a son with Asperger&#39;s (age 10) and my daughter has anxiety and selective mutism (which is that she only talks to immediate family and absolutely no one else, she&#39;s 9).  I have one other daughter who has a mood disorder and anxiety.  She is in public school and will be coming home next year (age 12).  All take medication for their particular symptoms and in order to get the medicine, the therapist is required.  According to the treatment plan they have to be seen weekly.  I live in Indiana and our homeschooling laws are very lenient.  I only have to provide proof of 180 days of instruction if asked.  I tried to explain unschooling to the therapist and she does not understand.  I had already opened my mouth before I posted this to the list for suggestions and now it is &quot;out there&quot;.  I asked her to do some research online about unschooling before passing judgment.  I had originally explained their schooling as more of an eclectic style because I was going to keep making them do math and grammar lessons.  After I explored unschooling some more I decided that I didn&#39;t want to go that route.  It wasn&#39;t working for us and I don&#39;t see that that method of schooling is productive.  I am struggling myself as I feel guilty because I think that I am taking the &quot;lazy&quot; way out. I am working very hard on getting it through my thick head that this is a good method of homeschooling.  I am so worried that they aren&#39;t going to learn anything on their own.  They don&#39;t seem to be interested in anything in particular.  All of the articles and books that I&#39;ve read have kids who are always immersed in one topic or another.  What if they don&#39;t ever get interested in anything other than computer and X Box?  I am so confused.  I really want to be an unschooler and I want to trust in myself and my kids.  I am really grateful for a group like this that is there to give me such good advice.  Thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344648263">We have many therapists in our life as well due to autism in our 11 yr old and some developmental issues with my 5 yr old.  Currently we go to their offices but face having lots of them in our home beginning in March after my 11 yr old&#39;s scoliosis surgery.   All of her therapy at that point will be moved home.   I have thought about questions like this myself and remember when this child was little and we did have home therapy and i was homeschooling the older ones using a more traditional homeschooling method. I remember  feeling a bit like I was being &quot;watched&quot; (mostly my perception as I was new to homeschooling and a teacher by education and felt very out of the norm!)    <br/>
<br/>
At any rate recently Ainsley&#39;s speech therapist asked her how homeschooling was going (the therapist has just begun this year to homeschool her son mostly because of what she sees in Ainsley as her child has developmental issues that were not being served in his school placement)   Ainsley&#39;s response was &quot;Oh we don&#39;t do that homeschooling thing anymore... &quot;    this puzzled the therapist so she asked further questions and Ainsley&#39;s response was &quot;Oh yeah we are still at home but we don&#39;t homeschool we just play, watch tv, do science experiments, build stuff, go places and things like that&quot;     The therapist was impressed that Ainsley is learning so much all the time yet &quot;feels&quot; like she isn&#39;t having &quot;school&quot;  !!   I think I won one for unschooling! HA!      <br/>
<br/>
 I am a bit nervous about having these new people in my home but I have learned over the  years if a therapist isn&#39;t on the same page I fire them.   I won&#39;t have homeschool unfriendly people and I won&#39;t have people who are not child sensitive.   I usually sit down before I hire a therapist and have a conversation with them about homeschooling and my background and what I believe and what I need them to understand about our family ... if they aren&#39;t on the same page I don&#39;t begin therapy with them.     <br/>
<br/>
When you are in the position of having a therapist involved with your kids they do become part of the family we have had our current PT and OT for 5 years.... our speech therapist for 3 yrs... you do get very involved with each other.   They become allies in the process of helping your child so it&#39;s hard to change major things in your life and worry about their disapproval.   For me it&#39;s not so much that I should &quot;care&quot; what they think but because of the relationship and my valuing their opinions (not above my own but still knowing their desire is for the best for my child as well)  but I respect their opinions and wouldn&#39;t have them involved with my children if I didn&#39;t.    I suppose it&#39;s complicated because alot of this is somewhat against the way I feel about what other people think about my unschooling and parenting, I do count the therapists as friends so to me I appreciate that they have opinions about  my children&#39;s well being.   I haven&#39;t had any of them ever<br/>
 question what I do but I credit that with the work and openness I had in the beginning of the relationship.  <br/>
<br/>
Soooooo my suggestion would be to talk to the therapist and tell her that you feel your current method isn&#39;t being successful and you are going to try some less structured methods that may not appear to be &quot;school&quot; to the uninitiated .    I can&#39;t imagine any therapist not noticing your kids growing and learning and becoming their own little people.   If she doesn&#39;t she may not be the therapist for you!   Hope this was helpful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-843963537">Hi Kimberly,<br/>
<br/>
After reading the posts about therapists, I feel compelled to chime <br/>
in here, too, with our experience. My daughter has always had <br/>
medical issues which has interfered with her attendance. Last year, <br/>
in fourth grade she developed frequent, severe headaches, and was <br/>
eventually referrred to an art therapist, who specialized with <br/>
children. My daughter was diagnosed with depression/anxiety. As my <br/>
dd&#39;s attendance did not improve, the school began to make an example <br/>
of me, and I was ticketed for &#39;contributing to the truancy of a <br/>
minor&#39;. She was academically proficient in all areas, and <br/>
participated in girl scouts, and music lessons. I was the PTA <br/>
secretary, and volunteered whenever possible. Even though my <br/>
daughter was obviously doing well in school and not &#39;truant&#39;, by <br/>
state standards was defined as such.<br/>
<br/>
I was quuestioned by every and anybody from the <br/>
teacher/pricipal/social worker/ police officer to the district <br/>
attorney. This process took over the summer and into Novemeber of <br/>
last year. I had changed to public homeschooling, where her <br/>
attandance was perfect, and her progress on target. The art <br/>
therapist was not only against homeschooling, but also traveling <br/>
with my daughter, and actaully said she thought the entire <br/>
homeschooling process was for my convenience. I faced opposition <br/>
from many unexpected sources, but after due consideration, have <br/>
stuck to my guns.<br/>
<br/>
The results so far have been a disappearance of all <br/>
depression/anxiety symptoms, and the return of my daughter&#39;s usual <br/>
bubbly self. She has a zest for life and new experinces. <br/>
Homeschooling didn&#39;t work out quite as I&#39;d hoped, and I love the <br/>
freedom of every day adventures becoming part of her education. By <br/>
the way, we eventually found the cause of her headaches-poor vision. <br/>
Although she had been checked annually, her vision decreased from <br/>
20/30 to 20/80 in a very short period of time. She also has <br/>
contracted only 1 virus/cold  since leaving school, as compared with <br/>
evrey 2-3 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Our experience has reinforced the advice I&#39;ve alwyas given to others:<br/>
Experts don&#39;t know your child better than you. In parenting, trust <br/>
your instincts and do what feels right to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801812430">Excellent. I have several kids, as I mentioned, with &#39;issues&#39;. This has been my greatest <br/>
ammunition against know-it-alls who think they should tell me how to raise my children. <br/>
what I tell them is that we are not working on academics so that we can focus on life skills. <br/>
We do maintain a daily routine, because the way my son and daughters brains work, they <br/>
need to have a similar routine every day. <br/>
<br/>
Trust the process. We&#39;re only 18months out, and we are seeing it happen. I was going to <br/>
blog about our weekend, following Sandra Dodd&#39;s webpage about &quot;If i let them&quot;. We have <br/>
just had amazing illumination over and over the past four days about how children will <br/>
choose other things. it might take longer, as I just posted in my blog about deschooling <br/>
my kids, because their brains often work in a way that creates a rigidity. It takes a while <br/>
and a lot of support to be able to let go of those things, but it does happen. I&#39;m all about <br/>
the blog ;-)<br/>

   I am struggling myself as I feel guilty because I think that I am <br/>
taking the<br/>
&quot;lazy&quot; way out. I am working very hard on getting it through my thick <br/>
head that<br/>
this is a good method of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I find it so hard to understand that people think of <br/>
unschooling as a &quot;lazy&quot; way to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Shoving worksheets and textbooks at children is INCREDIBLY lazy!!! With <br/>
unschooling, you *need* to be present. You *need* to be involved. You <br/>
*need* to be THERE, answering questions, figuring out solutions, <br/>
working WITH your children.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing LAZY about being an active, involved, caring parent! <br/>
I&#39;m worn out at the end of the day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   I am so worried that they aren&#39;t going to learn anything on their <br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Well, first of all, they WILL learn all SORTS of things on their own. <br/>
BUT that&#39;s not what unschooling is about. It&#39;s about sharing and DOing <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 They don&#39;t seem to be interested in anything in<br/>
particular. &lt;snip&gt;  What if they don&#39;t ever get interested<br/>
in anything other than computer and X Box?<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Ever? Really? Ok, so fisrt you say they don&#39;t seem interested in <br/>
anything in particular. THEN you say they&#39;re interested in the computer <br/>
and Xbox. Hmmm. BIG interests, really! Are you FEEDING those interests? <br/>
Or are you waiting for them to find &quot;real&quot; interests?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
 All of the articles and books that I&#39;ve read have kids who are<br/>
always immersed in one topic or another.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Uh huh---just like *your* kids! Yours are immersed in Xbox and the <br/>
computer. So what are you doing about that? Buying new games? Playing <br/>
*with* them? What &quot;topic&quot; would be of value?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I am so confused.  I really want to<br/>
be an unschooler and I want to trust in myself and my kids.  I am <br/>
really<br/>
grateful for a group like this that is there to give me such good <br/>
advice.  Thank<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
TRUST that they are learning from Xbox and omputers! Really! They ARE!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658847889">Thank you Kelly for your uplifting comments.  I am still faltering in my decision to unschool.  I am keeping a record of what they are doing and checking it against the state standards handed down from the state department of education.  I know it is unnecessary but for now it is what I have to do to make sure they are &quot;learning&quot;.  I went out and bout a bunch of board games and they have really gone over well.  We have played more games as a family in the last two days than we ever have in all of our years.  I am so grateful to belong to this group and that I get so much encouragement from all of your posts.  I have a long way to go to unschool myself so I can get on with letting the kids unschool themselves.  Thanks again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161619774">***What if they don&#39;t ever get interested<br/>

<br/>
This kind of question always startles me!  Really.   How could a person&#39;s <br/>
interests never grow?<br/>
<br/>
When a mom wonders if her eight year old will ever have an interest beyond <br/>
what he&#39;s doing today, she can think about what interested that kid at <br/>
three.  Think about what he played with and enjoyed and how some or all of <br/>
that has changed over the years.    Is that eight year old doing things <br/>
exactly the same<br/>
way he did them when he was two, or five?  Is he interested in all the same <br/>
things?   When a mom can look back over a child&#39;s life and see how much he&#39;s <br/>
changed and grown and discovered, there should be some logical connection <br/>
there, in her own mind, that as things have changed, things will change.<br/>
<br/>
***What if they don&#39;t ever get interested<br/>
in anything other than computer and X Box?***<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people will love video games their whole life long.  There&#39;s nothing <br/>
wrong with that.  I love gardening, I suspect I always will.  Even the most <br/>
avid pursuit of a passion doesn&#39;t exclude everything else.  People have to <br/>
eat - and kids will probably be interested in pizza or fondue or popcorn. <br/>
People wear clothes - and kids will probably be interested in getting shirts <br/>
and shoes and pants that fit.  People like to know what&#39;s going on, and kids <br/>
will be interested in talking with interesting adults.   So, even when an <br/>
interest seems all consuming, I think if a worried mom really looks at what <br/>
her kids are doing, she will see them interested in more than video games.<br/>
<br/>
***I really want to be an unschooler and I want to trust in myself and my <br/>
kids.***<br/>
<br/>
Why do you want to be an unschooler?   I really think it would help you, if <br/>
you have time, to write it out (to the list or just for yourself).  Really <br/>
consider all the reasons you think unschooling is the way you want to go and <br/>
why.   If you can clarify your own thoughts, then some of your worries will <br/>
disappear and we can help you with the ones that linger.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to be an unschooler because school at home is stressful and <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be working, we can give you links to writings about how much <br/>
time and commitment unschooling takes.  It&#39;s a different kind of commitment <br/>
than sitting down at ten in the morning with a workbook, but it&#39;s a real <br/>
commitment.<br/>
If you&#39;re burned out or stressed out and want a vacation and unschooling <br/>
looks like that vacation to you, then I don&#39;t think you understand what a <br/>
real investment of your time and energy unschooling will be.   If you need a <br/>
break, take one! &lt;g&gt;  Take a year off school and live with your kids like <br/>
you&#39;re on the longest and best vacation of your life, and in that time, read <br/>
about unschooling.  Write about your thoughts and what you&#39;re doing.  You <br/>
might find life with your kids - without school - answers most of your <br/>
questions. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***I am struggling myself as I feel guilty because I think that I am taking <br/>
the<br/>
&quot;lazy&quot; way out.***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s an important question and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re wondering.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Someone wrote to the list owners and moderators that she did not believe <br/>
unschoolers needed to provide a big and interesting world for their kids. <br/>
I am sometimes afraid that people who are just so burned out by the stress <br/>
of schooling and parenting and other of life&#39;s challenges, come to <br/>
unschooling because they believe they won&#39;t have to do as much.   I suspect <br/>
there are people who read some of the really beautifully written and well <br/>
thought out articles about all the learning that can come from TV and video <br/>
games and miss the whole point.  They read that TV is ok and they settle <br/>
into a life where their kids have all the TV they want but few other happy, <br/>
interesting choices.   Unschooling is not neglect.  Stress is not an excuse <br/>
for neglecting to provide an interesting life for our kids.   If a parent <br/>
can&#39;t, or doesn&#39;t want to, or doesn&#39;t believe doing things with her kids is <br/>
as important as providing food and shelter, she&#39;s not unschooling.  There <br/>
will probably always be times when money or circumstance keeps a family home <br/>
more, but home should still be a wonderful place with more to offer than <br/>
just TV.<br/>
<br/>
That you are wondering about your own motives seems thoughtful and <br/>
responsible.<br/>
What kinds of things will you be able to do with your kids at home?  What <br/>
kinds of places can you go to?  What do your kids love to do, and are you <br/>
able and willing to help them do those things?   Answering those questions <br/>
might help you.<br/>

he is a programmer for sony playstation. i call  everything, EVERYTHING my <br/>
children do &quot;research.&quot; If they are arguing with  one another they are researching <br/>
the topic of debate and politics. If they  are squirting each other as well <br/>

I live in Indiana and our homeschool laws are very lenient.  Really the only requirement that we have is to keep attendance and provide &quot;equivalent&quot; education.  I guess my problem lies within me because I am afraid that this woman will be turning me in and I don&#39;t want confrontation and I don&#39;t feel confident enough to stick up for myself if the authorities are brought in.  Thanks for all the advice.<br/>
