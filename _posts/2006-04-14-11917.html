Some of it might be LOCAL LAW or some crazy ordinance.<br/>
Here, you can&#39;t have more than 4 people living in a house who are <br/>
not parent/child realations. This is enforced sometimes beacuase of <br/>
super-extended families all living in one house. If someone <br/>
complains, it is the &quot;legal&quot; way to get rid of unwanted famillies. <br/>
Oh and as for how do they know? TAXES mostly, if it is adults.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when we bought our house, I was shocked to hear of such a <br/>
thing. Then I met some of the local board members at a city BBQ and <br/>
heard a great deal of couched racist remarks. I think it was a way <br/>
of being able to force immigrants and black families out of <br/>
town...the conversation led to talking about the ordinance and how <br/>
some famlies can only afford it if they all move in together. We <br/>
live in an area that is maybe 30% white/ 70% black, and we moved <br/>
here on purpose because we wanted to live in an afforable, diverse <br/>
community. Listening to these men assume we felt the same way was <br/>
yucky. Luckily, that is not the feeling I get in my particular <br/>
neighborhood at all. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if it would come up on &quot;Google&quot;.<br/>
I am gonna have to go try.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362206670">Ok, so I found something so far, but not the non-parent/child thing.<br/>
This one is square foot based and 2 per room:<br/>
<br/>
Bedford Heights enacted its first occupancy ordinance in February <br/>
1989. The 1989 version of the ordinance required a minimum of 300 <br/>
square feet of habitable floor space2  for the first occupant and an <br/>
additional 200 square feet for each additional occupant. Codified <br/>
Ordinance § 1387.14, the version of the ordinance now being <br/>
challenged by Housing Advocates was adopted in September 1991. The <br/>
1991 occupancy ordinance requires a minimum of 200 square feet of <br/>
habitable space for the first occupant and 150 additional square <br/>
feet for each additional occupant. The ordinance further requires a <br/>
minimum of 650 square feet of habitable space for dwellings having <br/>
four occupants. <br/>
<br/>
The deposition testimony of John Marrelli, the Bedford Heights <br/>
Building Commissioner at the time the ordinance was enacted, was <br/>
presented at trial. Marrelli testified that the ordinance was <br/>
passed, in part, due to residents&#39; concerns about too many people <br/>
living in one apartment, unsupervised children, children playing in <br/>
unsafe environments (e.g., balconies, parking lots, hallways, <br/>
elevators), noise, and overcrowding. Further, in response to <br/>
plaintiff&#39;s counsel&#39;s question of whether &quot;[t]he law was directed <br/>
towards problems associated with children and problems that other <br/>
tenants, adult tenants, were experiencing in relation to these <br/>
children,&quot; Marrelli answered, &quot;Yes.&quot; J.A. at 126. However, Marrelli <br/>
also stated that in passing the ordinance, the city &quot;did not look at <br/>
[the ordinance] as having an impact on any specific group of <br/>
persons. . . .We weren&#39;t trying to define who could live in the <br/>
suites, but how many.&quot; J.A. at 129. He further stated that the <br/>
ordinance was passed to address &quot;[h]ealth, safety, and sanitation&quot; <br/>
problems that could result from overcrowding. J.A. at 137. According <br/>
to Marrelli, the ordinance was enacted as a result of the 1988 <br/>
amendments to the FHA, and in response to landlords&#39; and tenants&#39; <br/>
complaints regarding overcrowding. Thus, after the FHA amendments <br/>
were passed, information regarding these amendments, along with a <br/>
draft of the proposed ordinance, was submitted to local apartment <br/>
landlords/owners. Bedford Heights, working with the <br/>
landlords/owners, developed the square footage requirements included <br/>
in the final version of the ordinance. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, B. Allen Clutter, Vice-President and General Manager of <br/>
Owners Management Company, testified at trial.3  Clutter stated that <br/>
although using a square footage occupancy standard is not <br/>
unreasonable, for consistency purposes, Owners Management imposes a <br/>
two-person-per- bedroom standard. Clutter further admitted that he <br/>
was aware that Owners Management was in violation of Bedford <br/>
Heights&#39;s occupancy ordinance due to the company&#39;s two-person-per-<br/>
bedroom standard. A letter Clutter wrote to the Mayor of Bedford <br/>
Heights shortly before enactment of the 1989 occupancy ordinance was <br/>
also presented at trial. This letter referenced the 1988 FHA <br/>
Amendments and pointed out that Bedford Heights did not have an <br/>
occupancy ordinance. Clutter indicated in his letter that he <br/>
knew &quot;there [would] be a great demand for family housing in this <br/>
area because of the school system,&quot; and thus, he &quot;urge[d] [the <br/>
Mayor] to consider proposing such [occupancy] standards so that over <br/>
crowding does not occur.&quot; J.A. at 523. <br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm.<br/>
We lived in 2 different apartments owned by Owner&#39;s Management for 7 <br/>
years before moving into our house 3 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like a good way to get more rent money if families are <br/>
forced to get bigger apartments if they have more people. It could <br/>
be a money issue rental-wise with the opposite sex sibling thing too.<br/>
<br/>
More things in this world revolve around money (in my opinion) than <br/>
around morality, even if it appears otherwise...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-329683843">Well, my searches came to naught for the ordinance I was told about <br/>
when we move here.<br/>
<br/>
I have however, learned a ton about my city!<br/>
Thanks for the &quot;Google&quot; nudge.<br/>
<br/>
The last thing I stumble upon was our school policy, includind dress <br/>
code and rules, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There is a homework recommendation for all kids in elementary school <br/>
for each night Monday through Thursday (with Friday off so kids can <br/>
spend time with their families, LOL) It ranges from 15 minutes a <br/>
night for KINERGARTEN to an hour a night in 6th grade!<br/>
<br/>
The girl across the street is in 1st grade and when I told her the <br/>
kids weren&#39;t going to school, she said &quot;That&#39;s good. It&#39;s boring. I <br/>
only like lunch and recess. And now they give us all this homework!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She still comes over to play, so that is cool.<br/>
Wish she didn&#39;t have to go to school, though... It is nice to have <br/>
her here.<br/>

My son was given homework every single day in kindergarten, even  fridays,  I <br/>
think that is just a little wayyyyyy too excessive, it just  burns children <br/>
out on school and the whole idea of learning.  He was the  one that led me to <br/>
the decision to homeschool and ultimately to unschool!   I thank god everyday I <br/>
was shown this path, granted I&#39;m new, and I&#39;ll make  mistakes, but they will <br/>
be the best for my children.  Not because I&#39;m  following a regime that someone <br/>
who has never even met my child has set up for  them!<br/>
