<div id="ygrps-yiv-463927315">I guess my next question would be how does an unschooler get into <br/>
college?  And what about keeping track of classes for high school <br/>
credit?  I&#39;m waaaaay far away from getting to that point, but wanted <br/>
to ask.  Is there a portfolio that&#39;s required of things he has done <br/>
to show to a college?  How does an unschooler graduate?  Does he take <br/>
the GED?  I&#39;m not even sure about homeschool high school <br/>
graduation...is that what they do?  I suppose every state is <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are still young...just turned 9 yo ds, 6 yo dd, 4 yo ds.  <br/>
When I first comtemplated homeschooling I thought of spending the day <br/>
at the park, going to the museum, reading all day long, etc.  I&#39;ve <br/>
recently come to the conclusion that &quot;school at home&quot; is not working <br/>
for us...my kids hate and I&#39;m getting more annoyed with my <br/>
kids...threatening to send them to a &quot;real&quot; school!  I shouldn&#39;t do <br/>
that, because I won&#39;t send them to our ps and can&#39;t afford private.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I&#39;m just rambling...this concept is so appealing to me, but <br/>
it&#39;s really scary...we get one chance with our kids and I get <br/>
overwhelmed!<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed in my 4 yo ds that he&#39;s a GREAT unschooler!  I have <br/>
neve sat down with him to drill the abc&#39;s into his head or teach him <br/>
how to write, yet he can write his own name (he was 4 in October), he <br/>
can write his numbers and knows all sorts of stuff about the moon!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just got to let go and go with the flow!  It&#39;s so hard!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674322306">What I would say to ease your mind is to look online at any  <br/>
university and college and see what they need to be enrolled. Most  <br/>
colleges don&#39;t even ask to see a graduation certificate. There are  <br/>
several different ways to get into college, locally our homeschooling  <br/>
group was just talking about creating a transcript covering basics,  <br/>
it&#39;s legitimate as a document of your school (that&#39;s here in Oklahoma  <br/>
of course) For example, OU doesn&#39;t require anything from  <br/>
homeschoolers beyond an ACT or SAT score on their admission forms.<br/>
<br/>
The great thing about kids is that you don&#39;t get just &#39;one chance&#39;.  <br/>
Even if you don&#39;t &#39;teach&#39; them what you feel they should know, they  <br/>
will learn it when they need it. If your son wants to go to college  <br/>
and he doesn&#39;t have the requisite math skills, there are classes for  <br/>
that. Kids who graduate from public schools take them every  <br/>
semester...same for any other topic.<br/>
<br/>
Just keep the faith!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve got minimum 7 yrs before your oldest would get to &quot;college <br/>
age&quot; (I&#39;ll get to that in a minute) and the requirements change <br/>
almost yearly it seems. Typically, an applicant would take the <br/>
SAT/ACT (just like any other applicant) and provide some sort of <br/>
additional info - portfolio is one way, curriculum vitae (kind of <br/>
like a life resume) is another, some schools have forms for <br/>
homeschoolers to help them put their real life stuff into categories <br/>
so that they can figure it all out...it varies. State <br/>
colleges/universities tend to be more rigid with requirements (at <br/>
this point in time) than private ones because the same state system <br/>
that runs the public schools tends to also have a hand in the state <br/>
college system. There are books available out there (I believe Cafi <br/>
Cohen has written a couple) on preparing for college when you <br/>
homeschool. But, I&#39;d say to stop worrying about that for now - how <br/>
do you know that your kids will (a) want to go to college? (b) want <br/>
to go at age 17 or 18? My DH worked for a decade (high tech jobs) <br/>
before starting college when he found something he loved and wanted <br/>
to pursue with that resource. Look at college as another resource <br/>
not as the be-all end-all required thing that we&#39;ve been trained to <br/>
consider it. It&#39;s not. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t need &#39;credit&#39; to &#39;graduate&#39; - they&#39;re not in school, <br/>
remember? Even if you did school at home, they wouldn&#39;t &quot;graduate&quot; <br/>
from high school in the same way as schools do (although some hs <br/>
groups have graduation ceremonies and all for those who want to do <br/>
that). GED is not necessary in most cases - they just put <br/>
down &quot;Graduated? Yes 2015 homeschooled&quot; on forms/applications <br/>
(unless your state required you to have a private school name, then <br/>
they can just use that for &#39;school name&#39;).<br/>

sorts of things are supposed to be hard and require someone to teach <br/>
him. Learn from him.<br/>

This sounds like many of our days. There&#39;s also playing with friends, being online, watching TV or movies, doing puzzles, playing board or card games, creating art, cooking, baking, sewing, downloading, talking, writing, sharing, and pursuing our interests right NOW.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good life. Isn&#39;t that what you want for your kids? College can happen easily if that&#39;s what your kids decide to pursue. In the meantime they&#39;ll have had years of meaningful learning. They&#39;ll have had years of making purposeful decisions. They&#39;ll have had years of following their bliss and already &quot;being&quot; the person they&#39;re meant to be.<br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>
