<div id="ygrps-yiv-554237726">I have been wanting to get my nose pierced for a couple of years now, but two things have kept me from doing so:  my newfound fear of pain and my age (42).  My 19-year-old dd thinks it&#39;s great and actually wants us to go together (she&#39;d get another lip piercing while I have my nose done);  one of my younger children thinks I&#39;m too old and says he&#39;d be really embarrassed if I did it! <br/>
<br/>
So, for those of you who have nose piercings, does it hurt and how old are you?  ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-717416908">I had my nose pierced when I was much younger.  I was 16 when  I pierced it ( <br/>
myself OUCH) but my sister at 36 got hers pierced professionally  and she <br/>
said it was like a little bee sting.  Well I am MISS ALLERGY  LOL I am pretty <br/>
much allergic to anything environmental so during spring summer  and fall I have <br/>
a hanky permanently attached to my nose.  The jewelry I  always used had <br/>
pretty short posts, so they didn&#39;t really stick out in your  nostril much.  But <br/>
when blowing you do have to be mindful that there is a  big metal thing that can <br/>
hurt you if you press to hard.  It took me  only one time of forgetting to <br/>
never do it again LOL.<br/>
