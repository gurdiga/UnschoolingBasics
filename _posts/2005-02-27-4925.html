<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399241597">The list has been a bit on the slow side lately, so I thought I&#39;d <br/>
pose some questions I&#39;ve been pondering myself.<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about how unschooling has helped me heal <br/>
myself and my family in a variety of ways....I had a spiritual shift <br/>
after my unschooling shift and even more healing happened in my <br/>
personal journey.<br/>
Beyond that, our unschooling philosophies have translated into <br/>
better relationships all around in our house, not only between our <br/>
children, but between Markus and I.<br/>
There&#39;s so much about unschooling that has been healing for us. Does <br/>
anyone else have stories to share about this?<br/>
What significant healing (if any) has your family found after <br/>
adopting an unschooling lifestyle? How has it affected your <br/>
relationships  with your immediate family or with others?<br/>
Has it increased your feelings of confidence in yourself and your <br/>
ability to learn new things at any time?<br/>
<br/>
There are many things in my journey that have assisted me in healing <br/>
from self esteem and relationship issues, but I can trace a lot of <br/>
my shifts back to my unschooling shift. Maybe that sounds too <br/>
simple, but it&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
How about the rest of you?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are such deep questions, Ren, but I&#39;ll take a stab at it.<br/>
Our family has always unschooled, our ds is 9.4 and dd is 3.5. I thought we <br/>
were unschooling, but I discovered we had lots to learn when I first started <br/>
reading at unschooling.com and the lists. There I discovered just how <br/>
controlling we were of all that our son did. The usual food, tv, bedtime controls were <br/>
very much in place. Letting go of those things brought us a lot more peace in <br/>
the house, helped my ds to learn a lot about himself thru making choices and <br/>
having more control over himself. Letting go of theneed to judge what he was <br/>
doing in a day as worthy or not worthy was also very healing, seeing the value in <br/>
whatever he does, in every minute of every day, has made all the people in <br/>
this house so relaxed and happy. <br/>
My husband really struggled with the control issues, more so than I did. He <br/>
has really relaxed now, and is enjoying the relationship with his children so <br/>
much more. We have really &quot;gelled&quot; as a family, we can feel the connections <br/>
strongly, and have a lot more fun doing things together. <br/>
As far as increasing my confidence in myself, and my ability to learn new <br/>
things at any time, I think that I was always fairly diverse in my interests, and <br/>
willing to try new stuff, but now am much more likely to try even more <br/>
things. Our house is always so messy, strewn with books, crafts, games, pets. I do <br/>
now feel very firm in my philosophy of  unschooling, and am a strong advocate <br/>
for my children&#39;s rights to learn in their own way, in their own time. If a <br/>
situation arises during an outing or activity with the homeschool group here, I <br/>
am quick to help ds to do things the way he wants to, rather than the &quot;schooly&quot; <br/>
way the group sometimes espouses.<br/>
I think the respectful nature of unschooling now shows in our family, in the <br/>
way we treat each other and the way my children are in the world. They are <br/>
empathic and thoughtful, and creative and confident.IT has been very life <br/>
changing for all of us, and has allowed me to sort of re-parent the child in me that <br/>
was not raised this way. <br/>
Sort of a rambling reply, but it is hard to express the huge changes that <br/>
have happened here.<br/>
Great post Ren, I look forward to reading other replies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944299555">This is pretty deep and I am not sure I can sum up all the changes that have<br/>
come over me since discovering unschooling, but I&#39;d like to try.  My<br/>
children have always been unschooled.  (ages 8 and 10) Our journey began<br/>
when I tried to drop my oldest dd off at nursery school at age 4.75 one day<br/>
per week, in preparation for kindergarten, which would be 5 days a week.<br/>
Well, she didn&#39;t want to stay and she made that clear.  I found it kind of<br/>
shocking that it was normal to the parents and the staff to see a very<br/>
distressed child and think nothing of it.   At that moment, I decided to<br/>
homeschool (had been thinking about it anyway) and it wasn&#39;t long before I<br/>
discovered unschooling and realized that it wasn&#39;t much different than what<br/>
I&#39;d already been doing with my kids all along.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Reading unschooling lists gave me the knowledge and courage to further<br/>
advocate for my children.  It helped me to accept my children the way they<br/>
are without comparing them to other children of the same age.  It helped me<br/>
to learn to live in the moment and to be a better, less controlling parent.<br/>
It helped me not only to accept myself and my differences from other people,<br/>
It helped me to appreciate myself and my children and our differences from<br/>
other people.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I too had a spiritual shift and that helped me to let go of some<br/>
preconceived notions I had with regards to religion/spirituality.  It sounds<br/>
so simple to say that but it went deep. I was able to get over feelings of<br/>
guilt that I wasn&#39;t even aware of on some levels, that were there from my<br/>
own upbringing.  It was very freeing.  I credit the unschooling lists with<br/>
helping me to think outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is so hard to put into words how I feel about all the changes that have<br/>
come about in the years following my discovery of unschooling.  Our lives<br/>
are SO rewarding and fulfilling and Peaceful!  We are just a very happy<br/>
family.  I&#39;ve challenged myself to reach for dreams for my children that<br/>
seemed impossible.  In learning to be my children&#39;s best advocate, I have<br/>
also learned to be a better advocate for myself.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have told this story several times now, about getting a horse for my kids,<br/>
but I just can&#39;t help talking about it some more because it&#39;s been life<br/>
changing in many ways.  It has just been the best thing for us.  In the<br/>
first few months of horse ownership, I faced and conquered many fears.  I<br/>
started taking riding lesson too (kids had already taken them for a couple<br/>
years) and it is such a huge feeling of accomplishment to go from being<br/>
somewhat intimidated by these huge animals, to not only feeling comfortable<br/>
around them, but confident in riding them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have always been a person who enjoyed challenges and learning new things.<br/>
I&#39;m a jack of all trades, master of none, and I like it that way.   But most<br/>
of those things have been static things that I&#39;ve learned to control.  I can<br/>
use a skill saw, shingle a roof, wire a house, etc.  Those things are just<br/>
things I&#39;ve learned to do with tools.  But with the horse back riding, it is<br/>
different.  You are reading (body language, etc)  a living breathing animal<br/>
and working with her and communicating with her and it is such a powerful<br/>
feeling of accomplishment.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
O.K. We are off to the tack store so I can&#39;t elaborate any more.  I wish I<br/>
could make how I feel clearer.  I&#39;ll think on it and maybe write more later.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-489410569">Although I can&#39;t specifically share a story on how unschooling has <br/>
helped my family to heal, I can share that because of unschooling <br/>
(we&#39;ve been unschooling since my kiddos were 3), our family doesn&#39;t <br/>
need healing at all!  We are a very close family, we love our kids <br/>
and treat them as our friends.  We are very open about ALL subjects <br/>
and issues, even if they are only 6 and 5.  I only wish I had this <br/>
type of schooling when I was a kid.  I remember crying everyday when <br/>
I went to school.  As a matter of fact, I was constantly getting <br/>
sent home from school because I would just cry all day.  I just <br/>
missed my parents sooo much!  This happened until I hit third <br/>
grade.  It was miserable!  And now I see my kids with no wake up <br/>
time, no bed time, and an extremely relaxed learning environment and <br/>
I notice that they are happy!  And they are learning things that his <br/>
same aged friends will have no clue about until they reach much <br/>
older grades.  As far as esteem goes, unschooling has helped me to <br/>
know that I can teach them in a different way then a school would <br/>
and they still come out ahead.  Overall, it is a great place to <br/>
be...!<br/>

Thanks for sharing this Nancy....it&#39;s really helped me be more at <br/>
peace with myself by honoring and valuing my children&#39;s activities <br/>
without all the judgement also.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really cool to hear from people that have always unschooled, <br/>
yet found healing as they dug deeper.<br/>
Even if it was more on a personal level than within the family, like <br/>
Maria.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing everyone...I&#39;ve been very touched by all the <br/>
posts so far. Unschooling philosophies are so Zen like to me. <br/>
Healing just goes hand in hand with it all I believe...whether it&#39;s <br/>
childhood crap we let go of, or better relationships we find (or <br/>
both for some of us:)<br/>

I love that story. I think it beautifully illustrates how <br/>
unschoolers see posssibility rather than dead-ends. How unschoolers <br/>
challenge themselves to find creative solutions, rather than just <br/>
accepting &quot;reality&quot; according to society.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being told all the reasons we couldn&#39;t have a horse when <br/>
I was a child...there was never any discussion of how we could make <br/>
it happen or exploration of ideas. Just &quot;no&quot;, we can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I think that has been another amazingly healing thing for me...to <br/>
see obstacles as challenges not a reason to give up a dream.<br/>
<br/>
We are moving slowly ahead with not one, but two businesses right <br/>
now. Slowly pulling in the pieces to make them a reality. There is <br/>
nothing but joy in this process, because it&#39;s what we love.<br/>
In the past, when the difficult parts of a dream or idea came up, I <br/>
would typically abandon the project. I had this notion that I was <br/>
not &quot;living up to my potential&quot; all my life...boy was that ever a <br/>
self-fulfilling prophecy. Yucky.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing Angela....I really enjoyed being reminded of your <br/>
dream come true.<br/>

Thanks.  Every day, at different times during the day, I think about how<br/>
great our lives are.  We have peacefulness, happiness, love, a great<br/>
relationship with our kids, a dh who supports unschooling and me, good<br/>
coffee.  :-)  We have enough. It just feels so good.  (Sometimes I do wonder<br/>
if we got someone else&#39;s share of happiness too.)  Life seems unfair at<br/>
times and I sometimes feel guilty for being so happy and contented.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Good luck with those businesses!  I am sure you will be a stronger more<br/>
adept person when you get over whatever stands in your way. You can do it!<br/>
Just think outside the box.  If you let people know what you need, sometimes<br/>
there are people willing to help you get what you want.  They can&#39;t help you<br/>
if they don&#39;t know what you want though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-98954352">I have enjoyed reading all the posts on this subject.<br/>
My own experience with unschooling only started last year after 3 years of trying to homeschool the traditional way (by sitting at the kitchen table with workbooks galore!) and failing miserably and making my child hate school.  I always hated school and the whole atmosphere of school (I am an introvert and school is NOT a place for introverted people!)  Living in a Navy family I had to change schools about 8 times and that added to my introverted-ness...LOL, is that even a word?!<br/>
All of my teenagers went to public school and have loved most of it (they are all very extroverted and have been extremely involved in band, cheerleading, leadership positions, etc.) so they all say they wouldn&#39;t trade it for anything.  My last two are graduating this year and they are both suffering from a bad case of &quot;senioritis&quot; LOL.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband has not been very supportive of this unschooling method.  We had several discussions here lately, really turning into arguments about it.  He has basically been patient with me the last year but finally felt the &quot;need to say something about my lack of schooling with Dakota each day.&quot;  I got so upset with him recently I couldn&#39;t even think of what to say to him.  So I decided what we needed to do was go away for a weekend and just spend time talking and discussing our ideas/opinions of Dakota&#39;s upbringing.  We did that two weeks ago and it was wonderful!  We were able to hash out everything in a non-confrontational, non-argumentative way and he understands where I am coming from now.  What he was having a hard time understanding was why all of a sudden last year I had made this change to completely unschooling.....he was looking at it as laziness on my part as far as Dakota was concerned!  All he knows is we had 5 other children all go through public school and all of a sudden now I am just keeping our last child home with me every day.  He tried to tell me he always loved school and he feels bad for Dakota!!  I asked him if he loved school so much why didn&#39;t he go on to college or take classes anytime he is interested in something.  I hated school but I love learning!!  I did get my college degree and continue to take classes now on anything I have an interest in that I can&#39;t learn on my own and need a little instruction in.  I showed him how he actually &quot;loved&quot; the activities at school he was involved in (football, basketball, etc) but he didn&#39;t love the book-learning part and he finally agreed.  I went into a lot of detail with him about the whole unschooling philosophy and how it fosters a child&#39;s love for learning and freedom to do that. I also pointed out all of the &quot;things&quot; Dakota has learned this last year ON HIS OWN!  My dh thought that &quot;learning&quot; came from me sitting at the table with a workbook teaching Dakota....he didn&#39;t realize that was completely Dakota&#39;s doing on his own.  I think he finally understands and is much more willing to help Dakota out now when Dakota asks a question or is curious about something.....he sees how he has a major impact/role on his learning experience.....it is not all me anymore! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Dakota pretty much has the freedom to do what he wants when he wants with a couple of exceptions.  He is always picking up a new hobby or wanting to try something new and I (now that my husband is on board, we) fully support anything he wants to try.  We do restrict shows he watches on TV/movies only because it goes against our Christian beliefs. (We don&#39;t watch it either though.) Biblically in Philippians we are instructed to fill our minds with only things that are good and wholesome, lovely, right and pure so we don&#39;t watch any trash TV or Rated R movies.  He wouldn&#39;t admit this to his friends but he absolutely LOVES watching things like &quot;The Wiggles&quot;, &quot;LazyTown&quot;, &quot;Out of the Box&quot; etc....all the musical shows on in the morning times.  <br/>
<br/>
The second thing he is &quot;made&quot; to do is our Bible studies....but even that can be made fun so he enjoys it now.  I am his Sunday School teacher too so he loves it when he already knows what the lesson is about on Sunday mornings and can answer all the questions! LOL  The kids think he is just so smart! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I guess the biggest &quot;healing&quot; through unschooling that I have experienced is watching Dakota enjoy his daily life in freedom and watching him absorb life like a sponge knowing he will be supported and loved in whatever he wants to do.  My heart breaks for kids (like those in my SS class) that hate going to school and wish they could just stay home with their mommy & daddy.<br/>

&gt; ability to learn new things at any time?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My first story is about my four year old and the huge change in his <br/>
personality. A little background: I&#39;d always wanted to homeschool, <br/>
but started off pushing and controling--well, attempting to control. <br/>
I was on homeschooling pre-K lists that talked about kids who enjoyed <br/>
the elaborate projects their moms set up. There were a ton of rewards <br/>
needed to keep the kids doing their work of learning the alphabet and <br/>
other 3 yr old-ish skills. Even before reading Alfie Kohn, I didn&#39;t <br/>
like that. So I kept reading and found unschooling. Even though my <br/>
son was only 3, it was a big switch from thinking about pushing <br/>
academics and controling food, tv, etc. to letting him set the pace <br/>
and make decisions for himself.<br/>
<br/>
As a baby and toddler, he tended to be anxious about new situations, <br/>
doing things for himself or group settings. (One on one, even with <br/>
new people, he&#39;s always been outgoing). I started relaxing controls <br/>
last May. There were some gradual changes in him and potty training <br/>
in Oct. when he turned four went very easily. I&#39;d expected every step <br/>
to be a big deal--the big toilet, public toilets, etc. but instead he <br/>
enjoyed becoming competant and mastering each step.<br/>
<br/>
Around Christmas, he was extremely anxious and stuck to dh and me <br/>
like glue. We thought it was because of the holiday (which was fairly <br/>
calm, but still a big change from our routine). Anyway, in January, <br/>
we figured out that it was a kind of emotional growth spurt! He&#39;s now <br/>
confident and wanting to prove himself in physical and other areas. <br/>
For instance, he went from refusing to be upstairs alone to opening <br/>
the gate to the stairs, closing it behind him (so the 2 yr old is <br/>
safe!) and happily playing by himself. From saying he couldn&#39;t open <br/>
the fridge to get his cup to trying to make a pb&j sandwich alone! <br/>
<br/>
Since it&#39;s been snowy and muddy, we haven&#39;t been outside much, but <br/>
we&#39;ve been developing our own gymnastics routines inside. Mikey <br/>
climbs on top of the reclining chair and does a backwards somersault <br/>
down the chair and lands on his feet. I still can&#39;t believe it when I <br/>
see him do that!<br/>
<br/>
Some of it is probably natural changes, but I *know* some of it is <br/>
because I&#39;m not trying to push, challenge, strongly encourage him to <br/>
do things, but instead being comfortable with his decisions about <br/>
when and if he wants to do something. I was anxious as a child (okay, <br/>
I&#39;m not exactly over it at 35) and I was pushed a lot and not <br/>
respected when I didn&#39;t want to do something. I know my parents were <br/>
trying to do their best and were afraid I&#39;d never do this, that and <br/>
the other thing, but I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve found a way to support my kids <br/>
without pushing.<br/>

my child over a verse in the Bible would be extremely important.<br/>
<br/>
There are many verses that contradict themselves, considering human <br/>
need is important to the unschooling process. Trusting our children <br/>
to find their spiritual path while watching, learning about things <br/>
that aren&#39;t completely &quot;pure&quot; according to Mom and Dad can lead to <br/>
some really great learning moments.<br/>
<br/>
If I limited what my children watched, they would have missed out on <br/>
some amazing things (because *I* didn&#39;t like them).<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about trust. It sounds like you&#39;ve all found a <br/>
wonderful place in your journey...it&#39;s SO awesome to have a dh that <br/>
understands and doesn&#39;t hassle your decision. Really cool.<br/>
<br/>
I encourage you to trust that young man fully. If he wants to watch <br/>
something that seems dubious, trust that he&#39;s getting something good <br/>
out of it. Truly.<br/>
It&#39;s hard to let go of our preconcieved notions of what is &quot;good&quot; <br/>
or &quot;bad&quot;, but since I have been able to do that, I&#39;ve seen so much <br/>
learning flow out of it.<br/>
