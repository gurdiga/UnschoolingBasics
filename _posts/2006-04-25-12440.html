<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611830596">I bet there are a lot of us tea drinking, weed loving, long skirted hippie <br/>
chicks around on these unschooling lists. At fifty, I still have long hair and <br/>
often walk the dogs barefoot through my urban neighborhood.  I&#39;ve got crystals <br/>
hanging in my sunnyside windows, a collection of windchimes swaying from the <br/>
eaves, and a riotous bunch of herbs, berries, and salad greens tumbling over <br/>
one another in the garden by the kitchen door.  I even live at the foot of the <br/>
canyon that Joni Mitchell sang about in the song &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; back in <br/>
the day.  I&#39;m told that Arlo Guthrie, Joan Baez, and others spent a few <br/>
nights here, back in the seventies.<br/>
Deeply entrenched, and proud of my hippiedom.<br/>
<br/>
Ahhhhh, I&#39;d better go put the timer on the oven, so the bread and granola <br/>
will be ready in the morning. <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt;So either she thinks I&#39;m pretty cool because I homeschool my kids and<br/>
 follow<br/>
 their lead or either she thinks I&#39;m that crazy woman with the weedy front<br/>
 yard wearing the hippy broomstick skirt sucking down Chakra tea.  Either<br/>
 way, I don&#39;t care.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

 hehehe... that made me laugh... because I am so that hippy chick with the<br/>
 weedy front yard with the skirt and the tea.... hehehe.... and it&#39;s so nice<br/>
 that I&#39;ve actually started to accept myself and love myself for being who I<br/>
 am and no longer feeling ashamed that I&#39;m not living up to some arbitrary<br/>
 standard that my family or the world has put on me.<br/>
