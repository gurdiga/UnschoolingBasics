<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091591103">Hi!  I am new to the group.  My husband and I have begun considering unschooling for our son (he is 2).  We have just begun our research.  So far everything I have read really resonates with me but we have some questions that I think can only be answered by experienced unschoolers.  So please look them over and answer what you can.  We greatly appreciate it! BTW... we live in Los Angeles if that is helpful in anyway<br/>
Aimee<br/>
1.  How does all of this work with college and the college admissions process requesting GPA, transcripts, etc?<br/>
2.  I am a psychologist and while I don&#39;t want to work full time I do want the ability to work part time.  For some reason I can&#39;t quite figure out how I am suppose to coordinate that.  Any feed back from working moms would be fabulous.<br/>
3.  What happens if our son decides later that he wants to go to school.  What is the process like to get him enrolled, how would they determine what grade he would be in etc?  Is it different for public and private schools?<br/>
4.  Athletics....Let me preface this by saying I am sooooo not one of those over involved athletic parents. Our son is pretty athletic for a 2 yr old so I think my husband has visions of college scholarships dancing in his head. Should he want to play organized sports at HS age what are his options?  Are there non-school teams that he could participate on or would he be able to participate in school athletics without attending school?    Just curious as to how that would work since I guess college scouts would typically see someone at high school games.   <br/>
Thanks Again!</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most colleges, especially the more selective colleges who are more  <br/>
used to homeschooled applicants, understand. By the time your son is  <br/>
ready for college, they should understand even better<br/>
<br/>
There are various ways of writing up what an unschooler has done  <br/>
instead of the standard classes. It helps to look at a transcript as  <br/>
a handicap rather than a deficit. A transcript only shows how well  <br/>
someone has jumped through hoops. An unschooling applicant can show  <br/>
what they&#39;ve been doing and their passions.<br/>
<br/>
Check into Wes Beach. He has a pamphlet I think about transcripts if  <br/>
you need reassurance now. But by the time your son&#39;s ready, things  <br/>
may have changed<br/>
<br/>

&gt; public and private schools?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends what his goal is. Depends on the school. You&#39;d go in and talk  <br/>
to the administrator. Usually they like to keep kids close in age so  <br/>
for grades before high school, he&#39;d just go into whatever grade his  <br/>
age would match. High school, it would depend.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends what state you&#39;re in. In some states (like Massachusetts)  <br/>
it depends what town you&#39;re in. Some states allow homeschooled kids  <br/>
to participate on school teams. Some states have an extensive  <br/>
athletic system separate from schools. But what&#39;s true today may be  <br/>
different by the time he&#39;s old enough.<br/>

<br/>
Part-time childcare is not a hard thing to coordinate--work out work schedules with your spouse (you work evenings when he&#39;s home, etc), get family members or friends to spend time with your child (possibly grandma would love a day with jr. once a week, and so would uncle bob), use another area unschooling mama to trade childcare hours with you (she watches your kid on Wednesday, you take hers on Thursday), hire a college student or unschooled teen...the possibilities are endless.  <br/>

There are so many ways to approach college beside the traditional<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m a working mom!  My work has changed over the past two years and I&#39;m sure<br/>
it will continue to change.  I used to manage our apartment complex and kept<br/>
my first daughter with me all day.  Then I switched to a call center and my<br/>
husband and I worked opposite shifts.  Currently I am working part time in<br/>
the early mornings and my sister (who lives with us)  gets up with the girls<br/>
in the morning.  This fall my husband will be quitting his job to go back to<br/>
college (night classes) and I will move to full time.  Eventually I plan to<br/>
go get my masters, but not right now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;3. What happens if our son decides later that he wants to go to school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> I went to 5th grade for a day, and 9th grade for a semester.  My sister did<br/>
half of 6th grade the other half of 7th and all of high school.  My brother<br/>
went to a private school for 1st and 2nd, and is currently working with a<br/>
charter school for 9-12th (his courses are not necessarily in any kind of<br/>
grade order).  We entered each grade based mostly on age (we also took<br/>
standardized tests some years which factored into it for our school<br/>
district).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;4. Athletics....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this could vary a lot by your school district.  When I was<br/>
elementary school aged my mother and some of her friends went to the school<br/>
board and had them set up a homeschooling program.  That meant we could pop<br/>
in and out of school for art classes, band, sports teams etc.<br/>
<br/>
Our high school district was a lot less accommodating, so after I dropped<br/>
out I just kept showing up to the classes and events I liked.  The security<br/>
guards and teachers all thought I had the principals okay. ; )  I even<br/>
played some large parts in our theater productions.  Sports may be a little<br/>
more stringent as they require grades and such, but that doesn&#39;t mean you<br/>
can&#39;t get creative and work with the schools and non school teams in your<br/>
area.<br/>

Write to me off list and I&#39;ll give you the details of where we meet - <br/>
we&#39;re mostly unschoolers. I&#39;m not there every week (my kids are 24, 21, <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1.  How does all of this work with college and the college admissions process requesting GPA, transcripts, etc?<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We make it work. I have one graduated from college (CSULB), one <br/>
currently a junior at UC Irvine, and one going to Cypress College and <br/>
planning to transfer to CSU Northridge. There are just about as many <br/>
ways of handling college as there are unschoolers in college - and it <br/>
isn&#39;t at all uncommon. But, it is TOO soon for you to think about it at <br/>
all. Seriously. Just know it can be and often is done. About the time <br/>
your son is the age where he&#39;d be entering high school, then maybe you <br/>
can think about it and consider the options at that time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.  I am a psychologist and while I don&#39;t want to work full time I do want the ability to work part time.  For some reason I can&#39;t quite figure out how I am suppose to coordinate that.  Any feed back from working moms would be fabulous.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have worked part time all along. I worked as a consultant (I&#39;m an <br/>
economist/statistician) on energy conservation projects for quite a few <br/>
years. Mostly I worked from home - I learned to breastfeed while typing <br/>
on the computer when I came up against some deadlines, but mostly I <br/>
worked when the kids were busy. I did hire a mothers helper to be here <br/>
with the kids for a couple of hours a day for a while. Later, I taught <br/>
community college courses - I taught weekend and evening classes so that <br/>
my husband was home with the kids while I was working.<br/>

&gt;    <br/>
 </span></blockquote>For public schools - they have to take him. You enroll him by showing up <br/>
and saying, &quot;Here we are.&quot; &lt;G&gt; If he enters school before high school, <br/>
they just put him in a grade level based on his age. If he enters after <br/>
9th grade, they&#39;ll decide if they are going to give him credits or not. <br/>
Again, why don&#39;t you wait until the time comes and worry about it then. <br/>
Too soon. Anything before 9th grade doesn&#39;t matter and if you make it <br/>
that far, the chances are that you would not even consider him going to <br/>
school and, even if you did, community college might be preferable.<br/>
<br/>
Private schools - they make their own rules and it all depends on the <br/>
school - there are elite ones that the kid will have to pass a test to <br/>
get into and others that take anybody who can pay and so on.<br/>

Just curious as to how that would work since I guess college scouts would typically see someone at high school games.<br/>
&gt; Thanks Again!<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seriously? I&#39;m giggling. He&#39;s two. Worry about this later. There are <br/>
tons of club sports for him to participate in up until high school and <br/>
even then, depending on the sport. I have a very athletic child - she&#39;s <br/>
18 and plays soccer and has a black belt in karate. She now coaches <br/>
younger girls soccer and is a karate instructor. All three of mine were <br/>
on swim teams, when they were younger. If he&#39;s into swimming or <br/>
gymnastics or quite a few other sports, then clubs are more important <br/>
than high school teams. They can also play sports at community colleges <br/>
and move from there to major universities with sports scholarships. It <br/>
isn&#39;t common, but some high schools HAVE allowed homeschooled kids to <br/>
play. Sometimes homeschoolers join public school independent study <br/>
programs in order to be eligible for sports teams. There are options. <br/>
Who knows, maybe his physical coordination will turn into a love of <br/>
dance, not sports. Too early to be thinking of this (I know, I know....).<br/>
<br/>
If you let me know where in LA you are, I&#39;ll put you in touch with <br/>
nearby unschoolers.<br/>

Sometimes its hard to find alternatives in the moment - for adults as much as kids - and it can be really helpful to remember that solutions are only solutions for right now, not forever.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;HOW does it all work out?  I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s a mystery!&quot; (Shakespeare in Love quote)  But it does work out, and here&#39;s what you need to know right now: it will surprise you no matter how well you think you&#39;ve planned, which goes double or triple for schooling toward college, btw, so don&#39;t kid yourselves about that! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>See answer above. But if you&#39;re curious for personal examples of how it worked out for other unschoolers, I guess it could help pass the many years before you&#39;ll learn how it all works out for your own two-year-old &lt;grin&gt;.  My daughter started a blog as she started community college at 15 and quickly embraced traditional academics, even as she continued thinking and learning like an unschooler (recommend you go back to the earliest dated entries and read chronologically.)  She also had unexpected obstacles we were able to help her overcome. Many new unschooling parents and open-minded schooling parents have enjoyed seeing these experiences through her perspective:<br/>

&gt; First, since you and your DH both are academically accomplished yourselves (me too) here&#39;s a sort of unschooling-dad curriculum I once wrote to a new unschooling mom as serious food for thought, to help you come at radical unschooling from the traditional school-research approach.<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/unschooling-lessons-for-school-minded-dads/">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/unschooling-lessons-for-school-minded-dads/</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The main idea here, to educate yourself about learning and unschooling, is very much something I did when Mo was little. I even went so far as to enroll in an online Montessori course - to learn the theory and some of the practice of classical Montessori education. Some of the basic theory is close to unschooling (follow the child, observe *before* you interfere... that sort of thing). I totally recommend any parent who is worried about academics and the &quot;how tos&quot; of autodidactism to do a bit of your own for awhile. It helps!<br/>
<br/>
That all being said, not all parents are willing to do that - I don&#39;t mean that in a snarky &quot;some people&quot; sort of way, I mean that its not  a good strategy for everyone. It doesn&#39;t fit the way everyone learns. Some dads (or working moms for that matter) do better with information presented in &quot;sound bites&quot; or articles left in the bathroom. Others do better by taking a deep breath and deciding that they can trust this other person to make good parenting decisions and learn by observation. There are many ways for adults to learn! Others mostly need reassurance and more ways to connect with the family - beyond &quot;what did you learn today.&quot; Just like kids, it can help a lot to think about how mom and dad learn and process information. What helps and what doesn&#39;t? <br/>

Most nights he bikes 20 miles or more, just for the physical joy of it. He&#39;s also a free running/parkour enthusiast. <br/>

. . .  My daughter started a blog as she started community college at 15 and quickly embraced traditional academics, even as she continued thinking and learning like an unschooler (recommend you go back to the earliest dated entries and read chronologically.)  She also had unexpected obstacles we were able to help her overcome. Many new unschooling parents and open-minded schooling parents have enjoyed seeing these experiences through her perspective:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992607691">I think it is normal to judge a philosophy on it&#39;s outcomes. And, as it feels like parenting comes with such huge responsibilities for the grown child your child will someday become, the outcomes seem to be the whole point. So when you are taking the road less travelled it feels like you are using your child as guinea pig for some new and largely unproven method of parenting and educating. I fully understand why you&#39;ve come here and asked questions about outcomes. <br/>
<br/>
The truth is that even the traditional methods are largely unproven. School is a novel game and they keep changing the rules and the curriculum and the approach as they go. Hoping that somehow these institions will get it all right and will be able to guarantee that everyone has the same opportunities as everyone else and stays enchanted with compulsory learning for at least the first 16 or 18 years of their lives. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is far more about today than it is about tomorrow. At Life is Good I bought a bumper sticker that says &quot;Unschooling for a Better Today&quot;. I love that bumper sticker. It&#39;s really hard to trust that if you make today better tomorrow is more likely to be better than if you are aiming for a better tomorrow. But it really does seem to work that way. And as awful as it is to say, tomorrow doesn&#39;t always come. And for those parents who have had to wake up the next day without their babies knowing that each today was good is far better than having aimed for the tomorrow. <br/>

addressed this.<br/>
<br/>
Trust unschooling and your own inner wisdom about your children. It is  <br/>
absolutely the best thing for your family.<br/>
<br/>
How can I meet their needs and be in the present moment living with  <br/>
them when I am fearing one possible future? Those are the moments I  <br/>
end up make learning takes. Right now my 22 month old pinches people  <br/>
sometimes. If I were afraid that she was going to use that tool  <br/>
forever I would react much differently.<br/>
<br/>
There are going to be a million things you didn&#39;t think of, plan for,  <br/>
expect. Trust the process of meeting needs and respecting where your  <br/>
child is.<br/>
<br/>
What I prepare for is what my child is involved in a passionate about  <br/>
RIGHT now. Dd12 is writing several hours per day and training for a  <br/>
triathlon. I feed those passions. I embrace them. She *is* a writer.  <br/>
She *is* an athlete. Ds6 skateboards, scooters, and lives Pokemon. I  <br/>
feed those passions as though he already *is* a professional skater or  <br/>
a pokemon trainer. Our kids don&#39;t need to wait until the grow up to  <br/>
*BE* something, there *ARE* something right *now*.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s so much pressure on parents to think about college etc early on. I have a coworker who is still in the &quot;trying to get pregnant&quot; stage who is already worried about what preschool to send her future children to to get them into the best private elementary school and thus into the &quot;best&quot; college. I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re doing that, but those kinds of messages and pressures are such a part of the culture that its natural to start to worry early on. <br/>
<br/>
 In my own life, I&#39;ve found that my very good education, which was designed to give me the most and best options, didn&#39;t do those things at all. I learned to be good at school, but I&#39;m not inclined to academia. So I had to leave school and deschool before I could start to learn what I really needed to know. <br/>
