<div id="ygrps-yiv-870500835">That makes me nuts...parents saying NO you can&#39;t have that, we can&#39;t<br/>
afford that...and then going out and spending $5 per day on coffee or<br/>
whatever THEY want. At our house, we have a &quot;wish&quot; board - stuff we&#39;d<br/>
love to have, do, try, etc - for instance, DH and I want a grain grinder<br/>
to make our own flour (since DH makes all our dough products from<br/>
scratch anyhow from bagels to pizza). DS and DH want a Wii. DH would<br/>
like to go back and visit Lancaster County PA (he grew up down there in<br/>
large part). DS would like drums. I&#39;d like an electric keyboard. Etc.<br/>
When the funds are available, we look at the list and see what item(s)<br/>
are highest priority and within the funds we have on hand. Sometimes, we<br/>
might get a lower priority item in order to get a couple things (a<br/>
smaller cappuccino plus a cookie instead of a large cappuccino). DS is,<br/>
in  general, considered as an equal human being with equal access to the<br/>
resources of the household. Often, I think, adults who see their wants<br/>
as superseding their children&#39;s wants have a twofold &#39;tape&#39; playing in<br/>
their heads - (1) &quot;Now I&#39;m a grownup and I work hard I can have anything<br/>
I want&quot;...making up for the things they couldn&#39;t have/do when they were<br/>
kids (2) &quot;You have to learn you can&#39;t have everything, you have to earn<br/>
it&quot;... corollary to #1, holdover from a childhood of earning what they<br/>
wanted rather than having access to family resources whenever they were<br/>
available. <br/>
<br/>
How to change the parents&#39; thinking? No idea...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037879844">This is an interesting question!  I&#39;m looking forward to what others <br/>
have to say.  I really like the idea of the &quot;wish board&quot; that everyone <br/>
is able to put their wishes on.  <br/>
<br/>
We have recently started giving the kids an &quot;allowance&quot; that is <br/>
basically what we would spend anyway...it&#39;s just giving them access to <br/>
it whenever they want/need it without having to ask for the money.  I&#39;m <br/>
NOT expecting them to buy their own clothes or food or personal hygiene <br/>
products or anything like that, though.  I think it&#39;s good for me to <br/>
keep in mind that I can (and will) still buy them things when we have <br/>
the money to do so.  I was finding myself having to say &quot;NO&quot; a lot <br/>
because finances are tight around here, but making sure we&#39;re putting <br/>
money aside for them to spend on a weekly basis will hopefully be <br/>
freeing to all of us.  We&#39;ll see :)<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear what others are doing regarding spending money and <br/>
kids!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251113371">A combo, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How can a child help get his parents to see what&#39;s important to HIM?<br/>
<br/>
How can an adult friend help the child&#39;s parents see what they&#39;re doing to the child?<br/>
<br/>
and <br/>
<br/>
How can a parent understand how his choices make the child feel unimportant and un-empowered as well as how damaging this can be for the child?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m so...vague. It was a specific scenario that I am trying to generalize a bit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-932069135">We give our kids a generous allowance and they have been using that to<br/>
pay for the things they want and they&#39;re both saving up for bigger<br/>
ticket items. So, that would be my recommendation to the parents -<br/>
give the kids a nice sized allowance! I&#39;m not sure what to suggest to<br/>
someone who comes in contact with the child who is not the parent,<br/>
except to suggest that they politely do not discuss the child&#39;s fiscal<br/>
decisions with the child, at least not in a negative light - keep it<br/>
neutral at worst. There are other ways to make a child feel important<br/>
without bringing money into the picture. Spend time with him, talk to<br/>
him,  include him in activities, and so on. Parents make financial<br/>
choices for reasons we often can&#39;t or don&#39;t see. ~Stacey<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s hard to respond without knowing much more about the family.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for tossing the idea around a bit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping that the parents will *start* thinking about the idea <br/>
<br/>
that they are denying their child the kind of nourishment you&#39;re <br/>
<br/>
describing. I think that&#39;s a VERY good way of looking at it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve yet thought all the other ways to acquire a computer.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t *have* to be a brand new &#39;puter from Best Buy. Some folks buy <br/>
<br/>
new computers like *I* buy groceries! They just want THE most current20and <br/>
<br/>
fastest on the market. Those folks toss old computers into landfills. I&#39;m<br/>
<br/>
sure they could find a nice one by asking around.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lessons can be bartered, and equipment can be borrowed and bought used.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just that there are sooo many more options for getting your children <br/>
<br/>
what they need. We also have a &quot;Dream Board&quot;---like Deb. It lists all sorts<br/>
<br/>
of things big and small for now and in the future. Helps us focus a bit<br/>
<br/>
more---AND see where our priorities are. We&#39;ve all had to adjust just a tad<br/>
<br/>
since having to buy a new refrigerator and finding out that Cameron needs<br/>
<br/>
his wisdom teeth cut out in January and that Duncan needs braces. Priorities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But we don&#39;t divide what the adults want/need vs what the kids want/need. We<br/>
<br/>
try to look at all wants AS needs. The only &quot;*need* that outranks others is<br/>
<br/>
Ben&#39;s need for an adequate amount of sleep at night: HE is the money maker <br/>
<br/>
here, and he can&#39;t get more sleep in the middle of the day like the rest of us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But otherwise, we try to look at what we want individually and try to make it <br/>
<br/>
happen. A pet peeve of mine is a mom who will buy herself a $4.00 cup of coffee<br/>
<br/>
but will deny her three year old a $2.00 toy due to a lack of funds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(OH--and DEb, I&#39;ll look in the attic and see whether we have an old keyboard. I <br/>
<br/>
might be able to cross off something on your list! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

This seems like a no brainier to me but then it assumes that the parents are <br/>

your expensive indulgences for the kids.  What about if the parents really do <br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If a parent does not have the $$ to indulge herSELF, why is she doing it? If she has <br/>
<br/>
enough to indulge herself, why can&#39;t she indulge the child?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MANY kids want everything they see. &lt;g&gt; They&#39;re kids. The ones who are denied everything <br/>
<br/>
as kids are the ones that grow up wanting sooo much as adults. Then they deny their own<br/>
<br/>
children things because they have that power and want it all for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the &quot;rent money&quot; that&#39;s the issue. It&#39;s money that is considered &quot;disposable&quot; <br/>
<br/>
for the parents, but NOT for the children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why doesn&#39;t the child rank as high as the adult? <br/>

We give our kids a generous allowance and they have been using that to<br/>
pay for the things they want and they&#39;re both saving up for bigger<br/>
ticket items. So, that would be my recommendation to the parents -<br/>
give the kids a nice sized allowance!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of generous allowances (especially if not tied to chores!). How much is generous to you?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We give Duncan (12) $10/week. That&#39;s easy for him to save up for a used game in two weeks or a new one in a month. He doesn&#39;t really have to pay for anything else. I cover all the other stuff in his life. We&#39;re discussing upping it next year.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I pay for clothes, food, lessons and/or equipment, trips, and subcriptions (netflix, WoW, gamefly).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m not sure what to suggest to<br/>
someone who comes in contact with the child who is not the parent,<br/>
except to suggest that they politely do not discuss the child&#39;s fiscal<br/>
decisions with the child, at least not in a negative light - keep it<br/>
neutral at worst. <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The issue is that the child unloads to his adult friend. She&#39;s someone he trusts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Trust* is such a key word here. If a child doesn&#39;t feel he can go to his parents with a serious problem, it&#39;s good that he has *someone* who will listen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know that I&#39;ve been the sympathetic ear and soft shoulder to numerous friends20of both my boys. I don&#39;t hide my disappointment in the way their parents treat them. I can&#39;t. I *can* empathize and brainstorm other ways for them to conquer their problems. And they spend enough time *here* that they know it doesn&#39;t HAVE To be that way at their homes either. I try to give them tools they can use at home to change things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are other ways to make a child feel important<br/>
without bringing money into the picture. <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Certainly! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I remember standing in a grocery line when I was a young teen. A toddler was screaming <br/>
<br/>
bloody murder to get a toy or piece of candy while his mother completely ignored him. <br/>
<br/>
My father leaned down and said, &quot;He doesn&#39;t want that piece of candy nearly as much as <br/>
<br/>
he wants his mom to pick him up and hug him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Spend time with him, talk to<br/>
him,  include him in activities, and so on. Parents make financial<br/>
choices for reasons we often can&#39;t or don&#39;t see. <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe. We can&#39;t KNOW someone else&#39;s financial situation.<br/>
<br/>
BUT...if mom&#39;s choosing $30 coffee but won&#39;t buy a $20 soccer ball, something&#39;s screwy. Or <br/>
<br/>
if the parents are making up excuses for not getting a computer, priorities ned to be examined.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about saving $$. When we took Cameron out of a private school, we didn&#39;t figure<br/>
<br/>
we&#39;d be *saving* money: we decided to spend the same amount on his education---just in a different<br/>
<br/>
wa<br/>
y. Even public schools cost $$. The cost of lunches and books and uniforms should be the <br/>
<br/>
MINIMUM an unschooling parent spends on his child&#39;s unschooling education.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We look at (sports and music) lessons and computers and travel and books and art supplies as a <br/>
<br/>
HUGE part OF their education. I don&#39;t see any of that as &quot;frivolous&quot;---even if (or maybe <br/>
<br/>
*especially* if) the interest is short-lived.<br/>

I saw that a lot when I hung out with AP parents. It was very hard to be<br/>
around. Such unnecessary struggles. I found that I really had to stop being<br/>
friends with certain people after a while. It just hurt too much to see the<br/>
dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
We have no disposable income on a regular basis so a wish board is really<br/>
important to us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992859435">Perhaps the adult friend of the child could help the child to find ways to attain what they need. Help them find a way to present their needs to their parents with a plan for filling them. For instance you could present the logical reasons for needing a computer, what kind of computer is needed including how much memory and what kind of video card and possibly the options for obtaining the computer and the costs for those options.<br/>
<br/>
Same with the sports equipment. <br/>

If a parent does not have the $$ to indulge herSELF, why is she doing it? If she has <br/>
<br/>
enough to indulge herself, why can&#39;t she indulge the child?<br/>
<br/>
MANY kids want everything they see. &lt;g&gt; They&#39;re kids. The ones who are denied everything <br/>
<br/>
as kids are the ones that grow up wanting sooo much as adults. Then they deny their own<br/>
<br/>
children things because they have that power and want it all for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the &quot;rent money&quot; that&#39;s the issue. It&#39;s money that is considered &quot;disposable&quot; <br/>
<br/>
for the parents, but NOT for the children.<br/>
<br/>
Why doesn&#39;t the child rank as high as the adult? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699486695">How would you guys handle multiple children getting an allowance?  We <br/>
are matching our kids ages with their weekly allowance...so our 6 year <br/>
old is getting $6 a week, our 9 year old is getting $9 a week, our 10 <br/>
year old is getting $10 a week, our 12 year old is getting $12 a week, <br/>
and our two 14 year olds are each getting $14 a week.  The kids are all <br/>
very pleased with what they are getting...and VERY happy that it is NOT <br/>
tied to any sort of chore/performance/behavior in order to earn it!  <br/>
<br/>
But, I wonder if we should just give them each the same amount.  Why <br/>
should the 6 year old have to wait longer to get the game she wants, <br/>
etc?!  Then again, as they get older there are things that are more <br/>
important to them that cost more money...like Hollister jeans** and an <br/>
iPod touch!  I think we&#39;ll stick to what we&#39;re doing and I&#39;ll just help <br/>
the younger ones out when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
**I&#39;m certainly willing to buy my kids clothing, btw...but I am NOT <br/>
willing to spend $100 on a pair of jeans!  We do go looking at Good <br/>
Will and our local resale shop, but finding those big name brands <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen very often :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d still love to know what others are doing when they have multiple <br/>
kids of varying ages.  It gets a little tricky!  <br/>

instead of save :-)<br/>
<br/>
At our house we give money out when it comes in. My dh doesn&#39;t get paid<br/>
regularly so it always looks different. We do biweekly allowances per age (6<br/>
year old= $6, etc). My kids are (almost)12, 6 and 1. When we get larger<br/>
chunks of money we sit down together and work out the disposable income. The<br/>
adults pay the bills then what&#39;s leftover we divide up off our vision board.<br/>
It is different each time but the fact that remains the same is each person<br/>
is equal. If anything my dh or I will forgo if money is really tight because<br/>
we have pacience.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I wanted to write about is the adult listner. I find myself<br/>
in that position with the neighborhood (schooled) kids frequently. I say<br/>
what I can to listen and validate their experience. It hurts them that their<br/>
parent/s don&#39;t liste/accept/support them. I have no idea what to do if the<br/>
parent is also a friend or fellow unschooler.<br/>

them. She would buy low price items that didn&#39;t matter like t-shirts etc<br/>
than flesh out her wardrobe with a few high ticket items that really<br/>
mattered to her. Like guess jeans and white reebok sneakers (think 80&#39;s). It<br/>
really mattered to her.<br/>

None of my kids care but I would certainly find a way to get creative and<br/>

&gt; I like the idea of generous allowances (especially if not tied to chores!).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We recently stopped tying money to chores. We give them an allowance<br/>
to give them an allowance. DH is comforted by telling himself - and<br/>
keeping it to himself - that the kids will learn the value to money if<br/>
they have their own to spend. He and I never - believe me when I say,<br/>
&quot;never&quot;! - suggest that to the kiddos.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How much is generous to you?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both kids get $30/wk each. If DS(12) wanted to, he could buy a used,<br/>
or new, video game every week. Instead he&#39;s saving up for ...<br/>
something. Sometimes it&#39;s an Xbox360, sometimes it&#39;s a basic laptop,<br/>
now it&#39;s a Nintendo64 and some accompanying games. He has quite a bit<br/>
of money amassed for a 12 year old boy, although I know not as much as<br/>
some others his age.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I pay for clothes, food, lessons and/or equipment, trips, and subcriptions<br/>
&gt; (netflix, WoW, gamefly).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s where we differ somewhat. We pay for basics, and the kids can<br/>
buy above and beyond that if they want. Ex: I&#39;m more than happy to buy<br/>
DD(14) shampoo, but she wants BedHead specifically - the difference is<br/>
$10+, so she buys that for herself. I&#39;d buy her underwear, but she has<br/>
done that on her own of her own accord.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The issue is that the child unloads to his adult friend. She&#39;s someone he<br/>
&gt; trusts.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Y&#39;know, sometimes my kids lament to our friends (who tend to be their<br/>
friends too) that we can&#39;t do for them because we&#39;re broke, but then<br/>
I&#39;ll go buy Fair Trade Organic coffee beans. What they&#39;re not telling<br/>
you - being that they are *in the moment* - is all of the things that<br/>
we *do* do for them. The piano lessons, the soccer gear, the brand new<br/>
shoes, the trip to Chinatown NYC for a birthday, etc etc. I wonder if<br/>
there&#39;s a side of the story that the adult friend isn&#39;t hearing?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *Trust* is such a key word here. If a child doesn&#39;t feel he can go to his<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-266713592">So you guys give out $60/week and we give out $66/ week...so that is <br/>
a fairly generous amount :)  <br/>
<br/>
I felt a little jumped on when I was asked why I wouldn&#39;t buy my <br/>
daughter the $100 Hollister jeans, but I see that you also don&#39;t buy <br/>
a bottle of shampoo that costs $10 more than the other affordable <br/>
shampoo you would buy!  I am more than willing to put $20-$25 towards <br/>
her desired Hollister jeans purchase IF she is in need of another <br/>
pair of jeans.  I just bought all of the kids 5 pairs of jeans each.  <br/>
My other 5 children could care less what brand they are, but my 14 yo <br/>
dd on the other hand wants brand name.  I have NEVER made her feel <br/>
badly about wanting brand name!  I have always tried to help her find <br/>
them for cheaper when possible.  I truly couldn&#39;t afford Hollister <br/>
jeans, so I told her I could buy her 1 pair of Hollister jeans or 5 <br/>
pairs of cheaper jeans.  She opted for 5 pairs of cheaper jeans...and <br/>
I ended up buying her jeans from Aeropostale (online for $12-$20 each <br/>
pair)!  The other kids got their jeans from Walmart and Target for <br/>
about $10-$18...and everyone is happy.  She also has one pair of <br/>
Hollister jeans that were given to us as hand-me-downs last year.  <br/>
They have a hole in the pocket, so just the other day my hubby and I <br/>
took them to a woman who does complicated clothing repairs and we&#39;re <br/>
paying $17 towards the $27 repair.  I just bought her 5 pairs of <br/>
jeans and our finances are really tight right now, so she is very <br/>
willing put $10 out of her $14 weekly allowance towards fixing the <br/>
jeans.<br/>
<br/>
We all do this thing we do differently and I am happy to see/accept <br/>
that!  I think the fact that some of us have 1 child and some of us <br/>
have 4 or 6 or 8 children makes a big difference in how we can each <br/>
handle money/allowance when it comes to our children&#39;s needs/wants. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-851701561">Times have changed! &lt;g&gt; When I was a child, my brother and I each got a quarter/week. That&#39;s also how much I got per HOUR as a babysitter (1973)!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Duncan (12) gets $20 every other week. Cameron (20) gets $50, and that is supposed to kind of cover gas. It does *now*, but it didn&#39;t come close three months ago! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Duncan&#39;s will go up next year; and Cameron is probably moving out, so his will stop then. <br/>

I would love to know what others consider to be a generous allowance?  <br/>
We just started the allowance thing and with 6 kids it gets <br/>
expensive!!!  Do you give each child an equal amount or do you give <br/>
them an amount based on their age? <br/>

just a point which offering a small amount of money appears more an<br/>

svelt and sexy all over? Not sure I&#39;d want to put out that kind of<br/>
money either for a few pieces of denim sewn together with a name<br/>
branded patch sewn on.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;High fashion&quot; is UNbelievable.<br/>
<br/>
My DD(14) is quite the fashionista, BUT she goes out of her way to put<br/>
together affordable, nay discounted!, pieces together to create her<br/>
own style. She&#39;s quite adept at it. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707677738">I have been reading this and AU for a few years now. I try my best to follow unschooling but with my 3 yo I am at a loss right now. I need some advice from some other people with late talkers. I am talking about age 3 and after. <br/>
 <br/>
William turned 3 in Oct. He is not a big talker. He has a handful of words he will say and use on a regular basis. He will also sometimes repeat things but they are not words he usually uses. Since he does not talk much communication is hard at times. There are some days where it seems all he does is YELL. I mean that SHRILL high pitched yell that makes your ears hurt. This happens when he wants my attention (will not say mombut will say daddy sometimes), something upsets him, he does not want XYZ (like today he wanted the TV off so he yelled), ect ect. I KNOW why he does this. I know he is frusturated. I know it is the best way HE knows to get my attention. I know all this. I know he is not doing it to annoy me or anything. We have always been of the mindset that he will talk when he is ready. He babbles ALL the time. Holds conversations with me, his toys, his brothers, himself but this is all in babbles that we can not understand. He is a very bright<br/>
 kid. He was doing puzzles early, imaginative play WAY before most kids I know, ect. ect. Not that I am comparing him to other kids just saying that I know it is not an intelect thing. <br/>
 <br/>
Right now we are in the process of getting his hearing checked. He screams with loud noises like the smoke detector, his baby brother crying a certain way, people singing close by (like in a restaurant singing happy birthday), ect ect. I took him yesterday but he would not let the earbuds go in his ear so we will be working on that and trying again. He also will repeat some words and they wil sound NOTHING like the word he is trying to say. So we do not know if that is part of the speach issue. <br/>
 <br/>
What I need to know is what can I do to help this. Some days I am ok with the screaming. However some days (like today) there is A LOT of it and it just starts to grate on my nerves. I guess I just need some been there done that stories and am wondering when your kids really started talking more then one word here and there. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I pay for clothes, food, lessons and/or equipment, trips, and subcriptions<br/>
&gt; (netflix, WoW, gamefly).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s where we differ somewhat. We pay for basics, and the kids can<br/>
buy above and beyond that if they want.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---but what I listed above I DO consider &quot;the basics.&quot; Clothes, food, lessons, equipment, trips, subscriptions---all those are basics here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Y&#39;know, sometimes my kids lament to our friends (who tend to be their<br/>
friends too) that we can&#39;t do for them because we&#39;re broke, but then<br/>
I&#39;ll go buy Fair Trade Organic coffee beans. What they&#39;re not telling<br/>
you - being that they are *in the moment* - is all of the things that<br/>
we *do* do for them. The piano lessons, the soccer gear, the brand new<br/>
shoes, the trip to Chinatown NYC for a birthday, etc etc. I wonder if<br/>
there&#39;s a side of the story that the adult friend isn&#39;t hearing?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Very often, there IS. And that&#39;s something to consider.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But what&#39;s being missed by the parents in this case is the FEELING of lack in the *child*. If the *child* feels deprived---no matter what the parent feels, that feeling needs to be taken into consideration by the *parent*. It&#39;s about the CHILD&#39;S perception.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Why* does the child feel deprived in *any* way? What is the child NOT getting that makes him feel that way?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It truly doesn&#39;t matter that the child has/gets EVERYTHING his little heart desire<br/>
s. What matters is how he feels---and why. If he *feels* deprived, why is that? What&#39;s missing? Why does the child feel the need to focus on something like coffee?  Because the child sees it as a &quot;luxury&quot; item???  (This was the example given to me. Fair Trade Organic Coffee Beans seems to be a popular item for kids to complain about. Lucky me---I don&#39;t drink coffee. &lt;G&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s lamenting to a friend, then there&#39;s something that&#39;s missing in his relationship with his parents---maybe monetary. Maybe not. But there&#39;s something lacking there, one way or another.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157807649">Well, the original premise has the parents buying EXPENSIVE coffee --<br/>
not a need, but a want, and a want that could be filled in a less<br/>
expensive manner.  If they sat down and calculated what they were<br/>
spending on the coffee, and what they could save if they drank a less<br/>
expensive brand, they could tuck a little aside for those other things.<br/>
<br/>
One thing, of course, could be to let the kids in on income/outgo, so<br/>
that they understand that the money really isn&#39;t there.  <br/>
<br/>
I think, however, that meeting SOME expenses of a child&#39;s interests<br/>
(especially as their education is on the line; who knows where those<br/>
interests will lead to?) is a valid thing for a child to expect. <br/>
Perhaps, though, the parents could help the child develop a way to<br/>
earn money for the things he or she wants.  Then the child will feel<br/>
more in control of those aspects of life, and the parents won&#39;t have<br/>
to risk bankruptcy.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I received a request to post this from a reader:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ************ ********* ******<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you do about a child who feels he isn&#39;t important or supported?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mom and dad complain regularly about how little money they have, but<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they don&#39;t hesitate to buy expensive organic free trade coffee and<br/>
indulge their own &quot;expensive&quot; wants/needs. So *their* wants are paid<br/>
for. But when the child wants a computer or sports gear or lessons for<br/>
example, it&#39;s considered a hardship, and the answer is NO.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; How do you delineate wants vs needs vs frivolity?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The child feels that *his* wants and needs are seen as expensive<br/>
 </span></blockquote>extras that they simply can&#39;t afford. He feels powerless and<br/>
unimportant. What can you do to empower him---and what secrets do you<br/>
have for making your child feel that he IS important and that his<br/>
