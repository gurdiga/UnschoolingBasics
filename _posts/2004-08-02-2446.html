<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092948420">I dont think I did an intro here. Sorry Amanda<br/>
<br/>
I am Laura from Maine (someday ill come up with a nickname or a sig line). <br/>
My husband Brian is an ASE Mechanic.<br/>
 I a SAHM and former Tom boy (still kinda&lt;G&gt;), US Marine (had to prove to my <br/>
dad that I could take worse than he could dish out),District Manager of 60+ <br/>
newspaper kids and drivers and owner of a quite successful . Com <br/>
CountryMooseKids (which I sank single hand-ed-ly by opening up a store front) Its all a <br/>
learning exp.. <br/>
<br/>
Our children are Dustin 12 (my 1st son, business assistant and loyal start up <br/>
business supporter,shipper,buyer and coworker. Its been a few years but he <br/>
was the nuts and bolts of our operation. He is also a handsome young man.<br/>
***<br/>
Cassidy 4 3/4 years old. She is beautiful,sweet,loving,sensitive and the <br/>
daughter that as a tom boy never thought id have. She is blonde haired, loves <br/>
barbies,dresses,jeans,cars,caliou,cooking and nurses her baby dolls just like mama.<br/>
***<br/>
Nicholas 2 years old. Most noticeable are his big bright glowing BLUE eyes <br/>
like I have never seen before. Everyone loves his eyes and long eyelashes and he <br/>
knows it.  He likes to play with his sister and gets sad when she needs <br/>
space. See &quot;keeping Peace posts&quot; He likes helping mommy and daddy, cars, <br/>
water,trampolines,trikes, and his binky. <br/>
***<br/>
Cameron 3 mo. Likes to nurse, smile and nurse. He is a very happy baby. <br/>
He loves his sister and brothers. He seems to be very giggly for Dustin the <br/>
oldest which is really cool because at 12 and 3 mo there isn&#39;t much in common.<br/>
***<br/>
I also have a room booked at the convention in August.<br/>
THE END<br/>
<br/>
Laura~Maine<br/>
