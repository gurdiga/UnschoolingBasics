 </span></blockquote>I hear what a struggle this has been for you, and I really admire you <br/>
for looking for answers.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how transparent you are about your struggle (i.e., are <br/>
you vocal about your desire for his WoW interest to wane?), but I <br/>
think the saying &quot;what you resist persists&quot; could apply here.<br/>
<br/>
Since you can&#39;t change anyone else but yourself, how about seeing <br/>
what happens if you fully supported his WoW interest?  What if you <br/>
were to sit with him while he&#39;s playing and really try to understand <br/>
what he&#39;s doing and what all the things mean on the site?  How about <br/>
creating a WoW character yourself and playing with him coaching <br/>
you?  Or even getting your own account and playing with him?  Not so <br/>
much to intrude on his space, but to embrace it with him.<br/>
<br/>
At the very least, since you are willing to facilitate his curiosity <br/>
in other areas, can you sort of suspend disbelief a little and <br/>
pretend that WoW is one of these other areas and facilitate it the <br/>
way you might facilitate a passion for architecture or knitting or <br/>
animal care or any other thing?<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps!<br/>

Amy, my daughter is 15 and just left school in October. *I* struggle with  <br/>
her doing &quot;nothing&quot; all day. Not even computer games, lol! Well, she IS doing  <br/>
Myspace a great deal and listening to music more, which I&#39;m glad of. <br/>
 <br/>
Remembering the process takes time is hard for me - especially with her  <br/>
father and other side of the family getting antsy and wanting her to show her  <br/>
work (and there is none). It&#39;s hard to wait out deschooling - especially when  <br/>
*I* am so excited about her future now, lol, and I want her to be too. But in  <br/>
time, the deschooling works - all that have done it, say it&#39;s so, and I figure  <br/>
THEY know, lol. Plus, my son, who is now 18, left school 18 or so months ago <br/>
-  and within 13 months (as long as he was schooled, mind you), he stopped <br/>
gelling  out and really began enjoying learning for the sake of learning again. <br/>
He now  spends hours at a time learning guitar and learning about Buddhism. He <br/>
took the  time needed to discover his interests and now he&#39;s developing them <br/>
on his own.  Grace, my daughter, will get there too...but it IS hard to &quot;wait&quot; <br/>
for that. <br/>

 <br/>
 Logan, my 14 (almost 15) year old son has recently discovered World  of <br/>
Warcraft.  As with other interests over the past few years, he has  immersed <br/>
himself in it.  I guess my questions to you would be...<br/>
 <br/>
 Why do you wish his interest in online video games will wain?   What would <br/>
be something you consider more valuable for him?   What if  he was playing <br/>
basketball for hours every day?  Reading for hours  everyday?<br/>
Playing the guitar?  Why would any of those things be more important  that <br/>
what he considers important to him right now?<br/>
 <br/>
Logan is playing WOW right now most of his waking hours and  I&#39;ve started <br/>
just going in and being in the room with him as he  plays.  He seems to really <br/>
enjoy me being there and explains all that is  going on.<br/>
 <br/>
  Last night, he came into the kitchen when I was cooking and  said,,,&quot;I need <br/>
a hug&quot;.   He felt this need to connect with me and we  sat on the kitchen <br/>
counter and talked about WOW for awhile.  I truly am  interested in learning more <br/>
about it and he asked if I would like to create a  character.  So I did.  We <br/>
went into his room and he helped me with  learning how to create the character <br/>
and start a quest.  It was extremely  challenging for me just to make my <br/>
character walk in a straight line!  &lt;g&gt;  I really did enjoy it in spite of my <br/>
frustration and plan on  playing more today.  <br/>
 <br/>
I know from seeing him over the years develop interests and immerse  himself <br/>
in them that it will wane a bit when the weather gets warmer and there  will <br/>
be something new.  It may well be another video game but whatever it  is will <br/>
be valuable to him for whatever amount of time he is involved with  it.  I&#39;m <br/>
the very same way!  If I&#39;m doing a house project, that&#39;s all  I do until I <br/>
finish it.  Last fall, I got involved in doing Zumba which is  a Latin exercise <br/>
program and I spent months going to classes, get certified to  teach it, finding <br/>
music for it and thinking about it most of my waking  hours.  It would have <br/>
been quite disheartening if someone in my  family<br/>
had wished that my interest would wain and I would find something else to  <br/>
do.  They were just as supportive of me as I try to be of their  interests.<br/>
 <br/>
Rather than waiting for some other interest to develop, try and find out  <br/>
more about WOW.  Play yourself or at least learn enough about it to share  the <br/>
excitement.  <br/>
 <br/>
Last night, in Logan&#39;s room, I picked up the box that the WOW game   had come <br/>
in and was reminded that it was made by Blizzard.  An unschooling  teen we <br/>
know immersed himself in video games and now has a job working for  them.  How <br/>
cool is that?<br/>

My dd is also 15, but she has been deschooling now for 19 months. At first, she spent so much time in front of the computer, and I thought it was all on myspace, but I found out she was surfing other sites as well. She read all about animal rights groups and global warming, and got into creating a very eclectic collection of music downloaded from limewire, and now burns CD&#39;s for people based on what they would love to hear. She has devoted so much time to myspace, instant messaging and text messaging on her phone that for awhile I thought maybe she was spending too much time on a social life, but now I realize that her social intelligence is a great strength and I would not interfere with it for anything.  Social networking via the internet is a modern marvel, really, and myspace is a great place to learn about other parts of the country and lifestyles, as well as web page building and design. <br/>
<br/>
I found that goal setting was a good way to encourage a varied lifestyle.  When her schooled friends trotted off to high school in september I asked her if there was anything she wanted to accomplish this year. She stated that she wanted to get in shape, so i got her a gym membership at the local gym, which is within walking distance. We also go jogging together in the local regional park.. She picked up &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; a week or so ago, and is nearly finished with it.  So...hang in there, doing &quot;nothing&quot; is very valuable.  After doing nothing going on two years, i don&#39;t see my dd as &quot;behind&quot; her schooled peers at all.  Quite the contrary, in fact. <br/>
Can you afford to send your dd to NBTSC this summer? <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;for the amount of time each day that he does.~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t tell you that it will wain...because my 18 year old plays a<br/>
LOT of hours still. In fact, he&#39;s dating a girl that plays AND her<br/>
parents play. He actually quit a very good guild he was in (best on<br/>
the Rexxar server at that time) in order to create an Alliance<br/>
character (should I hide his &quot;for the horde&quot; shirt now?) so he could<br/>
join a guild with Moira and her folks. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t even tell you all the things my kids have learned from video<br/>
games. It takes hours and hours and days and weeks in order to get<br/>
good at some of them. They are their own society and in order to<br/>
become a useful member of any society it takes a lot of time and<br/>
behaving appropriately for that society. Very complex and interesting<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor (18) is planning to move out this summer. I have a feeling the<br/>
WoW time will not wain much at all....he&#39;ll just have different people<br/>
to share it with. :)<br/>
<br/>
I really WISH I could play sometimes. I just have way to many<br/>
priorities and other interests so I won&#39;t give it the time it takes.<br/>
But it&#39;s such a cool game. Play it if you doubt me (I did...it was<br/>
quite amusing. Still have a lvl. 4 character sitting there just in<br/>
case I decide to spend the time);)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7007027">I really want to emphasize this idea from Marji of suspending  <br/>
disbelief and pretending that your child&#39;s interest is as wonderful  <br/>
and valid as anything you could possible have wished for. Banish  <br/>
doubts by replacing each and every skeptical thought with one that  <br/>
focuses on supporting his interest.The process of the parent doing  <br/>
this will really change the dynamics, often unspoken and unrecognized  <br/>
dynamics, between parents and kids AND, the big bonus is that the  <br/>
parents will, in fact, start to see the kid&#39;s interest more clearly,  <br/>
without the underlying he&#39;s-never-going-to-amount-to-anything-if-all- <br/>
he-ever-does-is-play-videogames anxiety. You&#39;ll have to focus on the  <br/>
specifics of what makes this such a wonderful activity and, lo and  <br/>
behold, it WILL begin to very clearly be a wonderful activity - you  <br/>
won&#39;t have to pretend after a while. The parent needs to be at least  <br/>
immersed enough in the activity to be able to thoroughly support it -  <br/>
expand on it, connect the rest of the world to it, enhance it. You  <br/>
ought to be able to buy your kid a WOW t-shirt because you get the  <br/>
joke and know he&#39;ll think it is really funny and cool.<br/>
<br/>
And, I teach economics and one of my students wrote a paper on the  <br/>
economics that WOW involves - it was his semester term paper and it  <br/>
was very detailed and interesting. So - in-depth knowledge of WOW paid  <br/>
off for him - he got an &quot;A&quot; in a college economics course.<br/>
<br/>
Also, always keep in mind the wider perspective - your child is  <br/>
learning that he should trust his own inclinations, that his interests  <br/>
matter, that he should pursue what he loves with zest and passion.  <br/>
And, he&#39;s learning that you are there to support him, not to thwart  <br/>
him, and that will be an incredibly important element of your  <br/>
relationship as he gets older! You&#39;ll be glad you developed it now.<br/>
