<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141695">I have been reading all the posts. Thinking about what everyone has been<br/>
saying. I can feel that beyond &quot;unschooling&quot; the list is about growth,<br/>
learning,etc. in general, as some have said it is. It is a way of life<br/>
like spirituality has been for me. The two seem interchangeable in some<br/>
respects. To me they are both about thought forms/ideas, the feelings<br/>
that come from them, and how we act out these feelings/emote them. It<br/>
seems for me it is never ending and then I remember spirituality is<br/>
similar to this. That we are here to learn. Learning is on every level<br/>
and never ending. I can see that I have been drawn to unschooling<br/>
because of my journey thus far. I have always been learning, stepping<br/>
outside the box, coloring outside the lines, expanding, growing, and<br/>
learning. When I first heard about unschooling it scared me just like<br/>
when I first heard about Reiki and then got attunements. When I realized<br/>
again that &quot;I&quot; was more than what I had previously thought. It was<br/>
something &quot;different&quot; and thus outside my usual way of thinking,<br/>
feeling, doing. When I look back on my life, I see this has always been<br/>
my direction. It took a lot of courage on my part. Sometimes we get<br/>
emotionally injured over our beliefs, sometimes worse. I am reminded how<br/>
important it is to have compassion for myself and others. How as I have<br/>
evolved, I didn&#39;t &quot;know&quot; and others were at times, frustrated with me,<br/>
and at times, they acted out these frustrations. I am so grateful for<br/>
lists like these and the strangers who were the wind beneath my wings<br/>
that enabled me to soar and learn. How precious this is. What a gift.<br/>
