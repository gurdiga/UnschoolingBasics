<div id="ygrps-yiv-411056375">Hello Everyone.<br/>
I wanted to say thanks to all who responded on my questions about food<br/>
issues and 2 yo social skills (what&#39;s realistic on a playdate).<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading posts and soaking everything in.<br/>
I released food restrictions from my 2yo about a month ago and I can really<br/>
see that her choices are somewhat balanced overall.  Some days we have<br/>
popsicles for breakfast and other mornings Kirsten asks for a banana or<br/>
cereal.  Letting go of &quot;my&quot; expectations of what she &quot;should&quot; be eating and<br/>
trusting her to learn for herself when she&#39;s had enough hershey kisses, has<br/>
allowed me to observe and be present with her.  Talking about choices and<br/>
providing a variety of food at all times has really brought us closer.  Some<br/>
days I&#39;m astounded by how much she doesn&#39;t eat of the items she asks for. I<br/>
think she is probably still testing me at times to see if I will tell her<br/>
&quot;no&quot; when she asks for the 4th pack of gummies.<br/>
I&#39;ve taken this principle and applied it to some of the things that happen<br/>
day to day.<br/>
<br/>
She likes to dress up and found a pair of fuzzy footed pj&#39;s this morning.<br/>
The former me would have battled over that because &quot;it&#39;s July!&quot;  Much to hot<br/>
for footie pj&#39;s.  Instead of starting an argument over it, we just went<br/>
ahead and put them on.  Just one little example of things I am trying to be<br/>
conscious of.<br/>
.......and so I&#39;m beginning to wonder just why I&#39;ve made things so hard on<br/>
my older kids for so long!<br/>
Anywho....lots of little steps in a different direction for us.<br/>
Thanks to all who spend their time and energy here answering questions.<br/>
<br/>
Renee<br/>
