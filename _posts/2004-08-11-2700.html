Pembroke.  I have unschooled her for Kindergarten and would like to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-259041510">I had the biggest &quot;Aha!&quot; moment today about how much my thinking has changed<br/>
since I got on this list (in a good way).  I was looking around the house<br/>
and instead of seeing &quot;messes&quot;, I was seeing &quot;play spots&quot; and<br/>
&quot;experiements&quot;.  I realized how much more relaxed my own feelings and<br/>
attitude about cleanup have gotten, and how I really only bother entering<br/>
into negotiations on the big messes anymore.  I think the key is what Ren<br/>
keeps saying about how if you put your focus on joy, everything else falls<br/>
into place.  I was sort of wondering how that worked exactly.  Now I see<br/>
that I have spent so much time recently focusing on my kids and my<br/>
enjoyment, our relationships, our connections, that I just haven&#39;t even felt<br/>
the need to be bothered about ways to get cooperation if they don&#39;t feel<br/>
like helping on the smaller stuff (which they often do, but if they don&#39;t so<br/>
what?).  It&#39;s just too much energy, and I realized that I&#39;ve become even<br/>
more sensitive to interrupting their playing, thinking, pondering,<br/>
wondering, well, just their day - all that other stuff that they&#39;re doing<br/>
that seems more important than cleaning up or worrying if they make a mess.<br/>
<br/>
I think a hallmark moment for me came when my daughter, who has picked up on<br/>
my own cues and tends to think a lot about &quot;messes&quot;, mirrored my new more<br/>
relaxed attitude by taking a page from her brother&#39;s page and smearing some<br/>
applesauce I thought she was eating all over the TV tray.  I said curiously<br/>
&quot;What are you doing?&quot;  She said &quot;An experiment&quot;, and I thought, &quot;All right!<br/>
Thank goodness I haven&#39;t made you too crazy about making a mess to<br/>
experiment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am so thankful for this list.  It&#39;s amazing to me that this happened<br/>
without my even being conscious of it until recently.  This really did feel<br/>
like it &quot;fell into place&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408524664">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I had a really terrible mommy moment today. Without getting into <br/>
specifics, I didn&#39;t get my way and I had a fit. I&#39;m having such a hard <br/>
time trying to feel the joy with my daughter. I&#39;m sick of playing Wizard <br/>
of Oz, I&#39;m tired of &quot;negotiations&quot; that end up feeling like I don&#39;t get <br/>
my needs met, and I feel like a total failure as a parent. I&#39;m tired and <br/>
cranky because none of us are getting enough sleep, I&#39;m eating crap, and <br/>
I&#39;m not exercising. (My problems, I know, not my daughter&#39;s). In short, <br/>
I&#39;m somewhat depressed. Late baby blues from my 4 month old? I don&#39;t <br/>
know. My sister called in the middle of it and told me that my problem <br/>
was that I negotiate too much with my daughter and that she needs to <br/>
learn that my priorities (to go to the mall and get out of the house) <br/>
are her priorities, and if I carry her kicking and screaming to the car, <br/>
she&#39;ll get over it and she&#39;ll end up having a good time once we get there.<br/>
<br/>
I DON&#39;T WANT TO DO THAT!!!  So, even though I f-ed up today by having my <br/>
hissy fit, I&#39;m not so far gone that I&#39;m taking that &quot;advice&quot;. So...I&#39;m <br/>
turning here to get support and encouragement from folks who are doing a <br/>
better job with gentle parenting than I&#39;m able to at this exact <br/>
moment.But, I also don&#39;t want to model uncontrollable rage (even though <br/>
she KNOWS it wasn&#39;t directed at her, and we talked about it after).... <br/>
so how do I get my needs met so that things don&#39;t bottle up and explode?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-240641450">Hi Jen,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Not sure I have much to offer, other than been there done that. Not filling<br/>
my needs makes for a VERY unhappy and resentful mommy. Having said that I<br/>
have found that I am WAY less resentful since I started following more of an<br/>
unschooling path. Not as much as some here, but more than we are used to.<br/>
Since I started examining my responses and decisions and how respectful I<br/>
was acting to my dd I have found my behaviour has changed and so has my<br/>
happiness with being a parent.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Today for instance, we got home a couple of hours ago. I have been so sick<br/>
for a week and I am NOT getting better it seems like it is getting worse to<br/>
be honest. Every moment of the day is a struggle and I have been short and<br/>
irritable with my dd. So we got home today after some hours out providing<br/>
her with some much needed energy activities, but I was just beat and feeling<br/>
awful. Well to my surprise dd has been playing on her own in her play room<br/>
since then with only the occasional interruption and I have been on the<br/>
internet, watching TV and trying to rest. It is amazing to me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You say you have a 4 month old and another. how old is the other? And it is<br/>
possible that this is part of PPD and you want to keep and eye on that.<br/>
Don&#39;t go looking just for typical depression symptoms. I had serious PPD for<br/>
two years that went undiagnosed by many medical professions, who I guess<br/>
knew nothing about it, until I read and article in Readers Digest and<br/>
diagnosed myself. It does not have to include not sleeping/sleeping a lot,<br/>
not eating/eating a lot, sadness, crying or those typical things. For me it<br/>
was anger, resentment, aggression bordering on violence, feeling homicidal<br/>
(towards dh:-) he is very resilient). I am not saying you are feeling any of<br/>
this, just thought I would mention it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Do you have someone who could come and stay with the kids for an hour or two<br/>
a week to give you a break? Even if you stay in the same house, but another<br/>
room, I found it to be very refreshing to be &quot;off duty&quot; so to speak. If so,<br/>
take advantage of it and go for it. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-635982123">I don&#39;t know your situation, so I can only speak about<br/>
mine.  I find it so much easier to know that I don&#39;t<br/>
*have* to do anything...If I *need* to go shopping,<br/>
usually everyone wants to go, but if they don&#39;t, it<br/>
can wait until Matt gets home, and the kids can stay<br/>
with him.  Or I can call him and ask him to pick stuff<br/>
up.  Or I can call him and tell him to meet us at the<br/>
park, and run and do my shopping while everyone plays.<br/>
 Or go on the weekend as a family.  The list is<br/>
endless.  On Monday, we had a realtor coming to look<br/>
at the house.  Even though we had the weekend to work<br/>
on it, my husband was working mostly on bigger<br/>
projects, like installing doorknobs and trim on the<br/>
walls, so all the cleaning didn&#39;t get done.  I<br/>
attempted to do it, and I asked Lauren to help me with<br/>
a couple of things....but I could see we weren&#39;t going<br/>
to get done without me demanding that she do more work<br/>
and working myself into a sweat as well...So I just<br/>
called and rescheduled for today.  Matt and I had two<br/>
more days to get the house clean, I didn&#39;t have to ask<br/>
the kids for anything, I didn&#39;t have to ask too much<br/>
of myself.  I could have been crazy, but why?  It&#39;s<br/>
just so much better having her come today.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, off to meet the realtor...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-5196372">Jen,<br/>
<br/>
I am sending you a huge *cyberhug* - I am so sorry you had a rough day and<br/>
are feeling so down.  I have seen you so much with Bethan and you are so<br/>
respectful and amazing with her.  I&#39;m sure she will not be traumatized by<br/>
your having your hissy fit.  We&#39;ve all been there, assuming there are no<br/>
saints on this list.  She&#39;ll just know you&#39;re human and now she knows she<br/>
doesn&#39;t need to be so perfect (LOL).  If you really think some of it is baby<br/>
blues, call your midwife and get some help for that part of it.<br/>
<br/>
The best I can do about getting your needs met in general is to say that<br/>
when I feel overwhelmed by that feeling, I try to sit down and really<br/>
identify and evaluate what those needs are that aren&#39;t getting met.<br/>
Sometimes right there and then I surprise myself with what they really are.<br/>
Sometimes I think they are things my kids should be doing, like going out<br/>
with me more, but it&#39;s really something like more time out of the house<br/>
which I could do on my own once I notify my husband, meaning their need to<br/>
stay at home gets met too.  I think balancing my needs with those of my<br/>
children&#39;s is the hardest thing I do... it really does get better as they<br/>
get older too....<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Joan<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I had a really terrible mommy moment today. Without getting into<br/>
specifics, I didn&#39;t get my way and I had a fit. I&#39;m having such a hard<br/>
time trying to feel the joy with my daughter. I&#39;m sick of playing Wizard<br/>
of Oz, I&#39;m tired of &quot;negotiations&quot; that end up feeling like I don&#39;t get<br/>
my needs met, and I feel like a total failure as a parent. I&#39;m tired and<br/>
cranky because none of us are getting enough sleep, I&#39;m eating crap, and<br/>
I&#39;m not exercising. (My problems, I know, not my daughter&#39;s). In short,<br/>
I&#39;m somewhat depressed. Late baby blues from my 4 month old? I don&#39;t<br/>
know. My sister called in the middle of it and told me that my problem<br/>
was that I negotiate too much with my daughter and that she needs to<br/>
learn that my priorities (to go to the mall and get out of the house)<br/>
are her priorities, and if I carry her kicking and screaming to the car,<br/>
she&#39;ll get over it and she&#39;ll end up having a good time once we get there.</div>

I&#39;ll just add a few words to what you have written. Have fun. :)<br/>

(<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I found that every time things go wrong for me it is based on some<br/>
&#39;judgement&#39; I have about me not being OK within any context. So this now is<br/>
my personal mantra. &quot; ... BUT I&#39;m OK.&quot;  Let&#39;s face it, each sentence above<br/>
that you wrote indicates some form of non-acceptance of self, and that does<br/>
not feel good.<br/>
<br/>
A while ago I read that we have this psychological built-in switch about<br/>
BUT. Anything that follows a BUT is more true than what went before the BUT.<br/>
I decided to put this natural switch to good use and add the BUT with a<br/>
positive expression after any &#39;negative&#39; expression I become aware of for<br/>
myself. I find the &#39;BUT I&#39;m OK&#39; the easiest. You can say other positive<br/>
things to yourself.<br/>

<br/>
First of all, it sounds like you&#39;ve identified some triggers already.....the sleep issue might not be something you can do much about with a little one, but you can choose to eat better and maybe take some walks with your little ones to get some fresh air and exercise. I find that getting outside and walking can really change the atomosphere when things get tense. The little ones can always find neat things to look at and observe whether you&#39;re in the city or country. Srap that baby to your body and GO.:)<br/>
Another good distractor when things are tense and I need a break, is pulling out some toys we&#39;ve had put away for a while, or some dollar store goodies I keep stashed (new pens, books, dolls, games etc...)<br/>
New food is another good distractor.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I&#39;m wondering, is are you stating your feelings honestly to your child? It sounds like you&#39;re playing this Wizard of Oz when you really don&#39;t want to...that isn&#39;t being honest and might be building up resentment for you. If you really don&#39;t want to do something, tell her and offer some other choices. Use creative problem solving to find a middle ground. Negotiation doesn&#39;t mean discussing until one person gives in, it means trying to come to a common ground, or find a solution you can BOTH live with.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got a lot to deal with just having a wee babe in arms....it takes a lot of prevention to take care of yourself and still give your older child what they need. And when you feel totally overwhelmed with nothing left to give, just know that others have felt the same way, that all is well and you&#39;re not going to have these feelings forever. Try to picture that little one as a teenager and just suck up every sweet moment while they&#39;re little.:)<br/>
Reading stories while cuddled up, or movies/tv is a great way to give an older child something interesting, while you can hold and nurse the baby. Use all the tools  you&#39;ve got!<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I thought of, is myself in these situations. I tend to start feeling the stress and I bury it until I&#39;m a ticking time bomb. It&#39;s important to state your needs and desires before it gets to that point. WE are responsible to head this off at the pass, our families can&#39;t read our minds. I&#39;m sure you know all of this, but sometimes we all need a reminder to speak up and state our needs loudly.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380381153">Wow, sounds familiar!  I have two small boys who are<br/>
21 1/2 months a part (1yr and a 3yr old) so I hear ya.<br/>
Do you have a group of parents that you can form a<br/>
playgroup with?  We do a playgroup once a week and<br/>
make it a potluck so everyone gets fed, the kids get<br/>
to play, and the parents get to relax a little and<br/>
share with each other.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m OK, you&#39;re OK!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945025598">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all for your posts, they were extremely helpful as was your mere <br/>
existence here! I have taken some of everything, and now I have archives <br/>
for the future. So the sleep problems aren&#39;t baby-related, they&#39;re from <br/>
DD. She had peacefully, gradually and successfully transferred into her <br/>
own bed in her own room at about 2 years old. She started have sleep <br/>
problems about three weeks ago, and sleeping with all four us in the <br/>
queen sized bed has not been getting anyone enough sleep, so we&#39;re <br/>
working figuring out better arrangements. Mostly it&#39;s about me <br/>
reconnecting/reassuring her during the day. We&#39;re figuring it out though :-)<br/>
<br/>
After I posted we went to the mall (for an entirely differently <br/>
reason....to fix the phone I had broken). It was DD&#39;s idea actually. <br/>
When we got home, my husband was home (about two hours early) because he <br/>
knew  how stressed I sounded. I went for a 15 minute walk by myself, and <br/>
when I came back DH made dinner with the baby in the sling, and DD and I <br/>
played on the trampoline, picked up the loose (empty) bee hives in the <br/>
yard (don&#39;t ask), and played &quot;Oh no the Giants are Going to Get Us We <br/>
Have to Run Far Far Away&quot; until it got dark out. Excellent reconnection. <br/>
When I asked DD about her favorite part of the day and the thing she <br/>
would most like to do differently in the future (part of our standard <br/>
bed time routine) she didn&#39;t even mention my &quot;hissy fit&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The next day, we dropped everything and invited a friend to go blueberry <br/>
picking. Another excellent day where I just relaxed.  What turned the <br/>
corner for me was seeking out help when I needed it (from you and from <br/>
my husband) and consciously rejecting the bad advice from my sister.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
Jen</div>
