 </span></blockquote>We ditched the toy box a few years ago and got containers instead.  <br/>
They are the clear drawers that stack.  The toys are organized into <br/>
different drawers, legos, cars, robots, people etc. so my son can <br/>
easily find what he wants without having to dump a whole toy box to <br/>
find it.  It makes clean up easy for me too.<br/>
