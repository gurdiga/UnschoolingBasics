<div id="ygrps-yiv-762529696">I have not read any thing from Dr Gordon  that talks about discpline. I am a big fan of him in relation to his support of breastfeeding. <br/>
I would really LOVE to have him as a pediatrician for my kids. <br/>
He seems to be wonderful and supportive of co-sleeping and breastfeeding.<br/>
<br/>
I also love the Sears gang and would also LOVE to have them as pediatricians for the same reason.<br/>
I was really lucky to read The Baby Book when my first ds was just 3-4 moths.<br/>
The Discipline Book is NOT gentle , mindful parenting in my opinion.<br/>
There are other books tht are far better than this one.<br/>
I would STRONGLY NOT recomend that book to any parent.<br/>
<br/>
I still love the Sears and Dr Jay Gordon.... I wish I could be in CA to be their client.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738174700">My 2 cents&#39; worth:<br/>
<br/>
I was not impressed by The Discipline Book by Sears (or the Nighttime<br/>
Parenting Book, either), and mainly on this point:  For me (for ME, not<br/>
necessarily for anyone else) he was long on theory and short on specifics.<br/>
Maybe I just need to be spoon-fed my information -- or maybe I need to be<br/>
de-schooled.  (No, I DEFINITELY need to be de-schooled.)  But for all the<br/>
stuff he talked about (and this was about 3 years ago), I was unimpressed.<br/>
Just from a practical standpoint.  I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;d agree with him now,<br/>
as my philosophy has changed so radically in these last 3 years.<br/>
