<div id="ygrps-yiv-69070807">Hi Kelli, I&#39;m not sure about 12 year olds, but this post is from a friend of mine on an AP list I belong to.  She has a 5 year old son and a 3 year old daughter.  I hope it answers some of your question, it sure answered some of mine I didn&#39;t even know I had!<br/>

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
   <br/>
  Five is challenging. But so is two, three, four, six, sixteen--all in<br/>
their different ways. Part of the trouble is that our children move<br/>
onward and forward through the different ages and stages, while we,<br/>
their imperfect parents, have just figured out how to cope with the<br/>
preceding one. Is it possible to attachment parent the older child?<br/>
Possible, necessary, critical. And here is where the difference<br/>
between AP &quot;things we do&quot;--co-sleeping, breastfeeding,<br/>
babywearing--and the AP &quot;things we are&quot; plays large. We don&#39;t carry<br/>
our five year olds, the majority of us don&#39;t breastfeed them any more,<br/>
we&#39;re not necessarily co-sleeping with them. The &quot;do&quot; stuff is gone.<br/>
The &quot;be&quot; stuff is all that remains.<br/>
<br/>
And how do we &quot;be&quot; with the older children? I think this is one of the<br/>
points at which our paths can diverge quite dramatically. And I don&#39;t<br/>
know that there is one *right* answer. For what it is worth, based on<br/>
my sample of one five year old shepherded through some challenging<br/>
stuff to date, this is my experience:<br/>
<br/>
At five, ds&#39;s world got larger. We&#39;re unschooling, so the massive<br/>
change that is five day a week kindergarten wasn&#39;t part of it--but<br/>
think of what a huge change that is, and how hard it must be sort out,<br/>
everything so new--but it was so clear that a five-year-old was so<br/>
different from a four-year-old. And absolutely, we butted heads<br/>
because while he had moved on, I was still mothering a four-year-old.<br/>
<br/>
A huge breakthrough for me was to make this world larger--ride his<br/>
bike on (safe!) streets, cross the street on his own, go into stores<br/>
on his own, play a bigger role in everything. I can&#39;t quite remember<br/>
all the different changes we did, but they&#39;re pretty much<br/>
irrelevant--they wouldn&#39;t work for your child. But maybe look at what<br/>
you can do--talk with her, what would she like to do now that she<br/>
couldn&#39;t (or wasn&#39;t interested) in doing a year or six months ago?<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I always come back when we run into &quot;downs&quot;: the only<br/>
person whose behaviour I can control is myself. And if I am unhappy<br/>
with how my child is acting, the first step is not to look for a way<br/>
to change my child, but to look at myself, within myself, and ask<br/>
myself what can I do to change how I am reacting and communicating<br/>
with my children? What am I doing--reflexively, thoughtlessly--that I<br/>
should change. Start with me. When I&#39;m okay, when I&#39;m balanced, when<br/>
I&#39;m grounded--well, very often, the problem goes away, because it was<br/>
in me in the first place. My children mirror me.<br/>
<br/>
And, if the problem really is in the other--if it is all my dh(5)<br/>
being crazy or my ds(3) being whiney--when I&#39;m taking care of myself,<br/>
reflecting on my behaviour, and acting from a place within me that&#39;s<br/>
grounded, well, then I can cope and talk and help them sort through<br/>
whatever craziness they are going through at the time without losing it.<br/>
<br/>
I strongly, strongly believe that any punishment--be it a time out, a<br/>
withdrawal of privileges, or the most innocuous manufactured<br/>
consequence--does not help these situations but serves to drive a<br/>
tiny, but ever growing, wedge between the attached parent and child.<br/>
The absolutely best thing I&#39;ve ever read about discipline was in<br/>
Gordon Neufeld&#39;s Hold On To Your Kids--absolutely aimed at parents of<br/>
older children, through to teens. We&#39;ve talked about this before, but<br/>
this is the essence of what I take away from Neufeld&#39;s chapter on<br/>
&quot;Discipline that Does Not Divide&quot;: &quot;Is [whatever action you were going<br/>
to take] going to further your connection to your child? Or is it<br/>
going to estrange you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So what do I do when I kind of want to throttle ds? I work at<br/>
re-connecting. I call them re-attachment days. Have a bath together.<br/>
Wrestle (I&#39;m not advising it for pregnant mamas :). Go for coffee<br/>
(for me) and cookie (for him) at the cafe, just the two of us.<br/>
Really focus on him and try to enjoy him. So often, that&#39;s what he&#39;s<br/>
asking for my being obnoxious--really focused, one-on-one attention<br/>
from me. Now if I could only ensure I always give it to him so that we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t go through the head-butting phase before I remember!<br/>
<br/>
What do I do in the moment? That&#39;s way harder in practice, no<br/>
question. When I&#39;m really frazzled, I leave notes to myself in<br/>
conspicuous places with &quot;when ds does x&quot; &quot;do not say/do this&quot;<br/>
&quot;say/do this.&quot; (Fridge and front door best places. Also, bathroom<br/>
door.) And I tell my children what they are--&quot;Those are reminders to<br/>
me of how I want to treat you and talk to you, even when what you are<br/>
doing makes me very, very angry.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I sing, &quot;I want to holler really loud, but I&#39;m trying<br/>
really hard not to, someone help me figure something else to do, I<br/>
think I&#39;m going to stand on my head to distract myself...&quot; (This works<br/>
really, really well with two and three year olds too, btw.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I don&#39;t catch myself in time and do all the things I don&#39;t<br/>
want to do: yell, threaten (if there is an &quot;if&quot; and a &quot;then&quot; in a<br/>
sentence, it&#39;s almost always a threat)... and then I apologize, try to<br/>
rewind, move forward.<br/>
<br/>
And always, always, I remind myself that 1) the worst behaviours<br/>
usually occur just before huge developmental/emotional milestones,<br/>
changes and breakthroughs, 2) my child is acting in the best way he<br/>
knows at this moment, and if that way is not acceptable to me, I need<br/>
to help him find another one, and 3) I love the little bugger more<br/>
than life or the universe, no matter how obnoxious he is. (This is a<br/>
good exercise too: after a hard, hard day, sit down and make a list of<br/>
all the things you love about your little one. From the shadow her<br/>
eyelash make on her cheeks when she sleeps to the way she kisses you<br/>
goodnight... everything you can think of.)<br/>
<br/>
And, finally, if I want my children to treat me--and others--with<br/>
respect, I must treat them with respect. No matter how angry or tired<br/>
I am.<br/>

It may work just fine for you. But it&#39;s not unschooling. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s say you&#39;re homeschooling. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

You really didn&#39;t ask a question. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My older son left school at the end of sixth grade. He was 13. He&#39;s now <br/>
20. My younger son is now 12, always unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
Many folks here have older kids--tweens and teens.<br/>
<br/>
What questions do you have?<br/>

I think &quot;attachment parenting&quot; should very naturally turn into  <br/>
&quot;relationship parenting&quot; as kids get older.<br/>

I believe you&#39;re in the right place as I believe mindful parenting can<br/>
be a continuation, if you will, of AP.  I always found it interesting<br/>
that sometime during the preschool years even the most devoted AP<br/>
started resorting to conventional parenting with arbitrary rules and<br/>
limits, rewards and punishments, and most importantly, the loss of<br/>
trust.  Trust in themselves as parents as well as trust in their<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
I believe at the core of AP is meeting your baby&#39;s needs, and trusting<br/>
the instincts inherent in the child/parent relationship to ensure the<br/>
best.  The same is true as they get older.  Only they become more<br/>
competent at articulating their needs as they get older, and, of course,<br/>
their needs change.  But, it&#39;s the same.<br/>
<br/>
I remember reading Dr. Sears&#39; Babybook where he encourages parents to<br/>
not say no to their babies and toddlers.  The example he gave was when a<br/>
toddler is a climber.  We shouldn&#39;t tell them no, we should make it safe<br/>
for them to climb.  Among the reasons was the fact that saying no isn&#39;t<br/>
going to keep them from climbing therefore, making it safe for them to<br/>
climb was the only logical and responsible thing to do.  The same<br/>
example can be applied to any age and any set of circumstances.  Don&#39;t<br/>
say no.  For one thing, they&#39;ll probably do it anyway and will have to<br/>
lie to you to do it which damages your relationship.  If you support<br/>
them and facilitate whatever it is they want to do, while staying true<br/>
to all your principles of safety and compassion . . ., you help them on<br/>
so many levels with the added bonus that it strengthens your<br/>
relationship and makes for peaceful living.  Win-win all around:o)<br/>
<br/>
I know it sounds a bit oversimplistic, and I don&#39;t even know if this is<br/>
what you were looking for, but I hope it helps.<br/>
