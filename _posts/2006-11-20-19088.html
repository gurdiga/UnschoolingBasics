But  what if you had wanted to live in the country specifically outside the <br/>
city  because you hated the air quality and traffic noise; he wanted to live in <br/>
the  city to have a shorter commute?  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
You can find solutions to air quality and traffic noise that would also not  <br/>
increase a person&#39;s commute.  Might have to look outside the box for  it.  <br/>
Moving to the country isn&#39;t the only choice in this scenario.   Seeing it as the <br/>
only choice only makes it harder to find a solution.  We  have found it easier <br/>
to look at the needs (air quality, land, less traffic  noise, with no longer <br/>
commute to work).<br/>
 <br/>
If this gets too off topic....from the basics of unschooling...Ren please  <br/>
just tell us and we will gladly take it to the CL list.  LOL.  We talk  about <br/>
this stuff all the time there so not in any way off topic.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think for many people Radical Unschooling and Consensual Living are  pretty <br/>
close.  But I know Radical Unschoolers that do not live  consensually.<br/>

I think it&#39;s a great topic for discussion actually. Because althout I<br/>
think if a CL family watched us interacting, they&#39;d think we were CL<br/>
for the most part. I find some of the ideas more about an &quot;ideal&quot;<br/>

<br/>
But Ren, that&#39;s the same attitude people take with *us* when they come <br/>
here to discuss unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For example, many people have written nearly the same thing about <br/>
unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Although I think if another family watched us interacting, they&#39;d <br/>
think we were unschooling<br/>
for the most part. I find some of the ideas more about an &quot;ideal&quot;<br/>
rather than what is reality. Because I&#39;ve never met a family that<br/>
doesn&#39;t teach in some way at least some of the time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll argue heartily about the difference between teach and learn. Can <br/>
you not see a different between compromise and mutual consent?<br/>
<br/>
When &quot;it&#39;s just semantics&quot; enters the arena, it&#39;s time to start <br/>
*thinking*---not debating.<br/>

finding a &#39;lowest common denominator&#39; or &#39;meeting everyone&#39;s needs&#39;.<br/>
The first doesn&#39;t neecessarily meet everyone&#39;s needs, but may not be<br/>
&quot;opposed&quot; by anyone. The second addresses needs and is *welcome* by<br/>
everyone. <br/>
<br/>
We focus on win/win solutions by identifying needs and then creating a<br/>
solution, not by determining which solution everyone can live with. It<br/>
feels very different when everyone trusts that their needs are going<br/>
to be heard and addressed. And everyone is working *toward* a mutual<br/>

No, I really don&#39;t!!<br/>
If someone is manipulating a person into compromise, that&#39;s not what<br/>

<br/>
Aha, maybe this is where I&#39;m having a communication breakdown.<br/>
Compromise is not decided by me or dh (the only time I really step in<br/>
to stop something is over safety, and then we discuss how to approach<br/>
the situation together to solve whatever issue is there). Compromise<br/>
here is reached by discussion of all parties involved.<br/>
<br/>
Good example;  We all drove a friend home this evening. Jalen was<br/>
sitting in back with friend and a brother until we dropped the friend<br/>
off. The boys were frustrated with his intensity and very loud voice<br/>
and wanted to move up front (our van has 8 seats, 3 in the far back)<br/>
to get away from him.<br/>
<br/>
Jalen was pissed off that they moved up because he probably felt a bit<br/>
rejected and he wanted to sit by Trevor. Trevor wanted to be as far<br/>
away from him as possible. We sat in the driveway for a good 5 minutes<br/>
discussing options;<br/>
Trading seats with Sierra, sitting up front and having Daddy move to<br/>
the back, sitting in the middle between Jared and Trevor etc.....<br/>
<br/>
He was initially screaming so much that every option just pissed him<br/>
off. So we sat. We waited. We offered options for everyone. Other kids<br/>
came up with their own options. He finally calms down enough to really<br/>
hear. Markus moves to the back and Jalen gets the front seat which<br/>
made for a calm and quiet ride  home.<br/>
<br/>
Every person discussed options. The people willing to move in order to<br/>
make it work, offered up their seats (Sierra, Markus and Jared). The<br/>
ones that were pissed off and unwilling to negotiate sat and waited<br/>
(Trevor). It all worked out, but it wasn&#39;t some parental compromise<br/>
decided FOR anyone. We&#39;re all part of the process......I still see<br/>
compromise being part of the method of coming to mutually agreeable<br/>
soluations.  Maybe it&#39;s a word choice...I don&#39;t know. I know I&#39;ve<br/>
&quot;given up&quot; certain things over the years by choice. If it really<br/>
bothered me I&#39;d find another soluation. I don&#39;t think giving up some<br/>
sleep for my baby is a bad thing...in fact, I really LOVED that<br/>
snuggly nursing time at night, though my body desperately needed sleep<br/>
at times.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;But see, that sounds like rhetoric to me. Meeting  underlying needs is<br/>
great, but you still aren&#39;t getting exactly what you  want initially. I<br/>
still want a dog, but I don&#39;t have one. <br/>
<br/>
My love  for Markus is greater than my need for a greyhound. So<br/>
everything in my  life is exactly what I choose. But that involves<br/>
compromise of some things  we&#39;d like. Dh would like our house to be<br/>
spotless....spotless....&lt;WBR&gt;he realizes that  the other family membe<br/>
ideas so he meets that need in some  creative ways, none of which<br/>
involve having our home be ultra-tidy or  nattering at the other people<br/>
living here.<br/>
<br/>
I can think of SO many  day to day solutions we&#39;ve come up with that<br/>
work great, but involve a bit  of &quot;giving up&quot;......again, not a<br/>
negative thing to us. I see giving to and  for others something that is<br/>
healthy when done for the right  reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I also think parents SHOULD give up some of their own needs in  order<br/>
to meet the needs of their child. That&#39;s part of being a parent.  My<br/>
very real NEED for sleep is not as important as a babies need  to<br/>
nurse. I see it as giving my child what they need, my CHOICE and yet  I<br/>
ignore my biological need for sleep to do that.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
You know, I really think it is great that you have worked out  solutions that <br/>
you and your family are happy with.  I just know that there  are other <br/>
solutions, as well, that do not involve &quot;giving up&quot; what you  want.  We have <br/>
discussed, a couple of times, the sleep issue as well as the  pet issue.  It is <br/>
amazing, when you start throwing out different solutions  and don&#39;t think someone <br/>
has to  &quot;give up&quot; what they want, how  creative people can be.  It just makes <br/>
me smile each and every time to see  how people can think so far outside the <br/>
box.  <br/>
 <br/>
For some people &quot;giving up&quot; what they want leaves them feeling empty or  <br/>
taken advantage of, and they then feel guilty.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I keep thinking of Ren&#39;s example of everyone wanting the front seat.<br/>
I only have 3 children and we go through this often.  Each person has<br/>
a reason why they prefer the front seat.  You even listed some of<br/>
those reasons:  ability to see better, control of the music or air,<br/>
the need to be not touching someone else, too much or too little<br/>
light.  Like Ren if I were to have to work through to a consensual<br/>
agreement everytime we left the house we would never get out of the<br/>
driveway.  So we have compromised by agreeing that everyone gets a<br/>
turn throughout the trip.  We rotate at different stops.  It does mean<br/>
that someone has to give up those things that are important for them<br/>
every third stop (and you wouldn&#39;t believe some of the stops I have<br/>
created to make sure everyone got a chance up front.)  It&#39;s working<br/>
for us and everyone feels valued at having their needs met at least a<br/>
third of the time while we are out and about.  Everyone feels that<br/>
their need is as important as the next person&#39;s, but I don&#39;t have a<br/>
double wide car to accomodate everyone&#39;s need to be up front all the<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I also think of our &quot;cat box compromise.&quot;  No one likes doing the cat<br/>
box.  Everyone loves the cats.  We&#39;ve agreed that we will each take a<br/>
turn rotating whose day it is (we do it by age, just so we remember<br/>
whose day it is) It makes for three happy cats and five people who<br/>
know that they only have to do the cat box every fifth day.   We<br/>
aren&#39;t hard core about it and will cover for someone who has the flu<br/>
or went to bed early or just got busy and forgot (or that person will<br/>
offer to do it early the next day so the box doesn&#39;t get too bad).<br/>
The alternative would be that we would either have a very smelly house<br/>
with one person upset that they were always having to do the gross job<br/>
even though 2 other people technically owned 2/3 of the cats or we<br/>
don&#39;t have cats.  Since we have agreed that cats are important to us<br/>
we worked towards a solution so that no one person had all the<br/>
responsibility.  It also assures that at least twice a week an adult<br/>
is doing a thorough job.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Michelle - the one who used to be the one grumbling about having to<br/>
always do the cat box even though none of the cats are technically<br/>
hers :-)</div>

I don&#39;t think compromise needs to enter into the equation, especially <br/>
when people trust in the process of finding a win/ win solution and are <br/>
developmentally able to negotiate, wait and brainstorm.<br/>
<br/>
Those are the things that I see most frequently act as roadblocks to our <br/>

you&#39;re able to engage and trust in the problem solving process--and, <br/>
imo, that&#39;s the hardest part--then compromise doesn&#39;t come into play at all.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see it as an issue of semantics at all, though I will agree with <br/>
Ren that there are moments in my life when the process itself breaks <br/>
down, and I step in with stopgap measures. Though even then, I try <br/>
really hard not to lose sight of the process itself--it&#39;s more like <br/>
buying time or creating space for the process to resume.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been at your house and heard &quot;stop now&quot;, I know there are issues<br/>

<br/>
And I never said we live consensually. &lt;g&gt; I think my family is one of <br/>
those radical families Pam was talking about who don&#39;t live <br/>
consensually---I&#39;m really a dictator.  &lt;beg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen Pam with her boys---it&#39;s pretty sweet. They&#39;ve been working <br/>
at it a while, so it&#39;s natural and...second nature.<br/>
<br/>
Like unschooling now for us. It&#39;s natural---we can&#39;t imagine any other <br/>
way to be.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to get there with CL, but I would need to put in more effort. <br/>
Just like everything: if it were easy, everyone would be doing it. I&#39;m <br/>
guessing it takes a lot of work---at first. Just changing the <br/>
vocabulary is tough! &lt;g&gt; And the *last* thing *I*  need is another <br/>
LIST! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Things move fairly easily here---no sibling issues. All the boys (Cam, <br/>
Dunc, & Ben) are pretty easy-going---I can imagine it would take *much* <br/>
more work with high needs kids who struggle with even small issues. We <br/>
have bigger problems when friends are over. Not that it can&#39;t be done! <br/>
Just that I wouldln&#39;t know where to start.<br/>
<br/>
Like unschooling, just because *you* can&#39;t see it, doesn&#39;t mean it <br/>
can&#39;t exist. Some people llive a radical unschooling life. Some people <br/>
can live consensually as well.<br/>

rather than the process. I guess there&#39;s a part of me that says &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
not buying into that if it can&#39;t work all the time!&quot;:)<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re talking about a process though, then we are constantly trying<br/>
to find win-win solutions where everyone has equal say and whose needs<br/>
matter. I&#39;m seeing many times when reality collides with the process<br/>
and something needs to be done in the moment. Am I focusing too much<br/>
on the exceptions? Because I see it happen in every RU family I know!!<br/>
I see it as compromise, but NOT as a compromise handed down by an<br/>
authority figure.<br/>

<br/>
No, in every situation, people aren&#39;t going to be able to have every <br/>

seriously) folks get worked up over the notion of &quot;core needs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we might have multiple needs:  a need to sit in the coolest <br/>
place in the van, a need to sit next to our momentary favorite person, a <br/>
need for peace and quiet. All of those needs may not be able to be met <br/>
at the same moment, which then requires a need for prioritization of needs.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people who emphasize taking children seriously emphasize the <br/>
need to take the initial expression of need/ want/ desire at its surface <br/>
value. I agree with that to a large degree when the alternative means <br/>
dismissing that surface expression for a need/ want/ desire that the <br/>
person doesn&#39;t consent to having: i.e. my child is pitching a fit <br/>
because he doesn&#39;t want a nap, but I, as his parent, can better judge <br/>
his need than he can.<br/>
<br/>
But, I don&#39;t agree that our initial need/ want/ desire is always the <br/>
most accurate expression of our underlying need/ want/ desire. I think, <br/>
rather, that there&#39;s often a knee-jerk/ reactionary/ defensive quality <br/>
to our initial expressions that further investigation/ brainstorming/ <br/>
introspection can excavate (ooh, that&#39;s a dirty rhetorical trick because <br/>
I know Ren respects the action of excavating).<br/>
<br/>
Does that make any sense? Does that clarify things any? (And again, I <br/>
may be totally muddying the waters somewhere in between what Ren and Pam <br/>

<br/>
Gawd Danielle! YOu have this amazing way of succinctly analyzing what<br/>
I&#39;m trying to say....but not as well apparently.<br/>
<br/>
I see no discussion about prioritizing of needs with CL. THAT may be<br/>
the thing I&#39;m missing. There are times we DO need to prioritize needs<br/>
(again, not decided by me, but by a discussion/excavation process).<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that sometimes I&#39;m reading the CL stuff and thinking<br/>
&quot;but do they have a family of 6 with at least one child dealing with<br/>
sensory/processing issues??&quot;  I DO believe in the process that I read<br/>
about. I just don&#39;t see how it won&#39;t breakdown in real life<br/>
moments....when we need to prioritize needs or take immediate action.<br/>
<br/>
I definitely see how the process can begin again, after the<br/>
moment......it&#39;s the moments I&#39;m seeing as a stumbling block I guess.<br/>

  I do see the difference between the two, I just don&#39;t think compromise is a bad thing.  I simply don&#39;t believe that every conflict/disagreement can be solved thru mutual agreement.  Sometimes the competing desires really are mutually exclusive.<br/>

Yes and sometimes people involved aren&#39;t in a place where they feel<br/>
like finding creative solutions. Sometimes a person isn&#39;t even<br/>
develpmentally ABLE to find a mutually agreeable solution. Jalen is 5<br/>

<br/>
Pat responds:<br/>
***I don&#39;t feel anyone else is responsible for meeting my needs.<br/>
However, what I have experienced is that when I trust others enough to<br/>
ASK them for what I need, I create an opportunity, without compulsion,<br/>
for them to help to meet my needs, of their own choosing. I don&#39;t<br/>
*expect* anyone to &#39;be willing/able to accomodate my needs&#39;. I have a<br/>
Trust in the Universe to provide for my needs. So, I believe that my<br/>
needs will be able to be met without compulsion or coercion of others. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sylvia:<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; Neither do I feel up to the task of guiding everyone thru the<br/>

<br/>
Pat:<br/>
***I have learned to trust the process. And in our family, everyone<br/>
works together to create solutions which meet each other&#39;s needs. It<br/>
is so much LESS of an undertaking than when I was trying to meet my<br/>
own needs alone (pre-dh). And waiting for others to meet my needs<br/>
could be a long wait, unless I *ask* for what I need. Other&#39;s Trust<br/>
that I won&#39;t *compel* them to meet my needs; and they are not<br/>
reluctant to help me to creatively meet my needs. And I similarly work<br/>
to creatively meet other&#39;s needs. Living with Trust in win/win<br/>
solutions is much easier than other interpersonal relationship<br/>
dynamics, from my experience. <br/>
<br/>
My experience has been that the process of living consensually<br/>
empowers and frees each person to Trust that their needs will be<br/>
addressed, and thus they can give freely also. Our son has been<br/>
effectively and creatively contributing solutions which address our<br/>
needs (and his own concurrently) since he was about 3.5 years old.<br/>
<br/>
I agree, trust is a hard thing to extend. Trust was easy for ds; and<br/>
thus, I believe it makes living consensually easier, since we (dh and<br/>
I, pre-baby) have always lived this way. We just continued by<br/>
including ds&#39;s objections/needs/desires and wants into solution<br/>
creation and he learned to do the same while very young. <br/>

  Sylvia:<br/>
  For any process to work, everyone must be equally committed to it.  How do you get kids who haven&#39;t lived that situation to become equally trustful and committed to it?  For that matter, how do you get adults to that point?   Also, it seems to me that CL is vastly easier with only one child, than with more children.<br/>

  Pat:<br/>
  And waiting for others to meet my needs could be a long wait, unless I *ask* for what I need. <br/>
   <br/>
  Sylvia:<br/>
  I&#39;m not waiting for others to meet my needs.  I&#39;m also not in the habit of asking for my needs to be met -- certainly not from my children.  Meeting my needs isn&#39;t their responsbility.  Getting my needs met is my job, and no one else&#39;s.  In all honestly, tho, I don&#39;t trust others to be willing/able to meet my needs.  Then again, my real trust circle is very small.<br/>
   <br/>
  As I type this, I realize I&#39;m just not in a good head-space for such a heavy topic.  Lots going on in my head right now, totally unrelated to anything being discussed here.  When I&#39;m in this space, I tend to look for a fight, just to have a release for the tension.  I should walk away for a while -- at least until things quiet down for me.<br/>
   <br/>
  Maybe I&#39;ll just read and explore CL later when I have more space for it.  Thanks everyone for all the good discussion, it&#39;s given me lots to think about.<br/>

everyone&#39;s&gt; needs are addressed and everyone tries to work out a<br/>
mutual solution. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m no CL expert... I&#39;m trying to grasp the nuances of it and a lot<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of it&gt; seems like rhetoric to me.  Compromise isn&#39;t a bad thing... I<br/>
looked it up..&gt;  it comes from the latin com (together) and promittere<br/>
(to promise).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Lesa<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lesa, I believe that I can only prioritize my own needs. I can not do<br/>
that for another. I don&#39;t prioritize that my needs are of a &quot;higher<br/>
priority&quot; (more important) than another&#39;s. So, I agree, that<br/>
consensual solutions do not &quot;prioritize&quot; one person&#39;s needs above<br/>
another&#39;s. We work to create solutions where Everyone&#39;s wants and<br/>
needs are equally valid, discussed, considered and addressed. No one&#39;s<br/>
needs are a &quot;higher priority&quot;. I believe in *consensus* &quot;everyone&#39;s<br/>
needs are addressed&quot;. Compromise, generally implies mutual<br/>
concessions. Positive consent, or creating solutions which are<br/>
preferable to both individuals, is a very different process.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine by &#39;rhetoric&#39;, you mean that &#39;this sounds good, but doesn&#39;t<br/>
really happen&#39;, or something along the lines of disbelief in the<br/>
process working. The process of creating solutions which address<br/>
everyone&#39;s needs to satisfaction and agreement can, and does, happen<br/>
many, many times a day in our home. Living consensually, like<br/>
unschooling, is a paradigm shift which takes time to integrate, in<br/>
order to become &#39;second nature&#39;. If there are specific issues which<br/>
seem daunting to create mutual agreement about, please feel welcome to<br/>
 consider discussing them on the CL list. <br/>

The child that wants hot chocolate right now, may or may not care that<br/>

I may say &quot;I&#39;ll make the hot chocolate after I help Sierra&quot; and that<br/>

not going to analyze the heck out of whether it&#39;s consensual or<br/>
not........I&#39;m going to decide what&#39;s important and do the thing!<br/>

<br/>
Everyone *is* getting what they need. No one is conceding anything, <br/>
which by definition means giving up, yielding or begrudgingly <br/>
acknowledging. It&#39;s a pretty negatively laden term, imo.<br/>
<br/>
Pat says she doesn&#39;t prioritize other people&#39;s needs, only her own, but <br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to mother multiple children without setting <br/>
priorities. There are lots of ways to multi-task, but not everything can <br/>
fall in that category at every moment. I haven&#39;t yet figured out how to <br/>
be in two places at one time.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the problem solving process itself can become coercive, <br/>
which is something Ren pointed out in another post.<br/>

<br/>
YEah, but it feels like it to the child that wanted X right NOW and<br/>
chose to wait so the other person could have Z. Happens all the time. <br/>
<br/>
One person is feeling cruddy and needs Mum close by, another person<br/>
needs me to drive to the store.<br/>
<br/>
One person wants to go to Best Buy for a video game, another person<br/>
wants to go to the park but we only have limited time before Mum has<br/>
to work. <br/>
<br/>
Someone wants to run to the grocery so we can make X and I&#39;m very tired.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, we get to everything eventually, but it comes by means of<br/>
concession. I don&#39;t get (nor does anybody) everything we want all of<br/>
the time in the moment. That means sometimes a person isn&#39;t thrilled<br/>
about the prioritizing that naturally happens. But it happens. And I<br/>
don&#39;t always get consent for it either.<br/>
<br/>
I remember in talking about Sam, you made the comment once that the<br/>
girls made enough concessions for him and you weren&#39;t willing to ask<br/>
them to do _________(can&#39;t even remember what it was now).<br/>
<br/>
Same here. My kids concede things they&#39;d prefer in order to assist<br/>
Jalen many times. Leaving the park the other day was their priority,<br/>
not his. In order to balance it all, I asked them to compromise their<br/>
immediate need of leaving in order to help Jalen get what he needed.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t mutual consent. They weren&#39;t wanting to stay. But they COULD<br/>
see that it was important to another family member and agreed to wait.<br/>
That&#39;s compromise to me. Not getting exactly what you want all  the<br/>
time, but knowing you&#39;re heard, you&#39;re important and your views matter. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127250126">One  person is feeling cruddy and needs Mum close by, another person<br/>
needs me to  drive to the store.<br/>
<br/>
One person wants to go to Best Buy for a video  game, another person<br/>
wants to go to the park but we only have limited time  before Mum has<br/>
to work.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
I personally would not prioritize someone else&#39;s wants or needs.  I  would <br/>
not say that the &quot;cruddy feeling&quot; person&#39;s need for me to be there is more  <br/>
important that the store is for the other person.  To them it might  not be more <br/>
important.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just as an example, because you threw them out there.  This is where  I think <br/>
when you are in a mindset of compromise and already believe that someone  <br/>
will give up something, you would only see maybe a couple of solutions.   Maybe <br/>
the person feeling cruddy will have mom by their side and the store will  wait. <br/>
 OR  one person will get to go to best buy while the other gives  up the park <br/>
or the park instead of best buy.  etc.<br/>
 <br/>
If it were me we would talk about the store and the  cruddy feeling.  Maybe <br/>
it would be fine for the &quot;cruddy feeling&quot; person if  someone he knew came over <br/>
for a few minutes and sat with him while I took  &quot;another&quot; person to the store <br/>
for a few minutes.  Maybe dad can take a few  minutes off his lunch break to <br/>
either pick up whatever it is at the store or  come home to sit with the <br/>
&quot;cruddy feeling&quot; person.  Maybe dad could pick it  up on his way home or we could <br/>
go out after dad gets home.  Maybe a friend  could go to the store.  etc, etc.  <br/>
No one HAS to give up what they  want, and when you know there is a solution <br/>
out there and are used to working  toward it, more possibilities and solutions <br/>
show up.  I know my boys are  both good at working out very creative <br/>
solutions. You tend to not get stuck and  say &quot;there is no solution to this problem so <br/>
one of us must give up  something&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
The second situation you mentioned with Best Buy and the  park, we might look <br/>
at our schedule to see if either something we are doing  before or after can <br/>
be moved to &quot;make&quot; more time for Best Buy and the Park, we  might want to come <br/>
back to either one after we do whatever that is limiting our  time, it is <br/>
near the holidays stores are staying open later maybe we could do  what ever else <br/>
there is to do and then come back to town to go out to supper and  hang at <br/>
Best Buy (we love Best Buy here&gt;&gt;&gt;:-))  Maybe what we want  at Best Buy can be <br/>
ordered or looked at online so it will only take a minute or  no time in the <br/>
store.  Maybe a friend can come by with her kids and take  one to the park while <br/>
I go with the other to Best Buy and then swing by the park  after to pick <br/>
that person up.  Maybe the other way around, maybe one would  like to hang with a <br/>
friend and his mom at Best Buy while I take the other person  to the park.  <br/>
Maybe since we do have limited time we would postpone both  until the next day <br/>
when we have much more time and can do both for as long as we  like.   etc.  <br/>
Many, many more options than just one person must  sacrifice what they want to <br/>
do.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway those are just a couple of examples.  And  those are some of the <br/>
things people bring to the CL list. Situations they  may feel stuck in, that having <br/>
another perspective on things may  open up more possible solutions and gets <br/>
you back in the right mind  set.  I think we all have times when we just don&#39;t <br/>
see a solution,  sometimes we are too close, too invested in a certain outcome <br/>
maybe.  But  no one is perfect and it does help to bounce things off of other <br/>
people.   It helps to see others working out different solutions even if the <br/>
same thing  isn&#39;t happening in your home.  And it works in a variety of homes, <br/>
there  are people on that list who are not even homeschoolers and a couple <br/>
who don&#39;t  even have children.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t see anywhere in what Ren was saying that the park or Best Buy<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be done later.  I really see her talking about *at this<br/>
moment*  &quot;*At this moment* I only have time to go either to Best Buy<br/>
or the park&quot;  Perhaps the choice is Best Buy because someone has a<br/>
desire for a specific thing and it works better with our schedule *at<br/>
this moment* and we will go to the park later or tomorrow or this<br/>
weekend.  I don&#39;t see this as one person has to completely give up<br/>
what one wants.  I see this as somoene having to help her family make<br/>
decisions on how we can best reach everyone&#39;s wants and needs where we<br/>
are now.  Sometimes that means that we have to prioritize everyone&#39;s<br/>
needs/wants.  Who is to say that the person going to the store won&#39;t<br/>
decide that the store isn&#39;t that important right now as his/her<br/>
sibling really just needs to cuddle with mom and that person remembers<br/>
how important cuddle time was for him/her the last time s/he was sick.<br/>
 I see nothing wrong with asking someone else to wait on something in<br/>
consideration of another person.<br/>
<br/>
We recently went through this.  We&#39;ve all been battling the flu in our<br/>
house and last week Emily (who had finally recovered) was really<br/>
needing to be outside in clean fresh air.  She really wanted to go to<br/>
the nature trail at the university, but Mary Elayne *really* was<br/>
feeling badly and Keon was coughing horribly.  They are both old<br/>
enough to stay by themselves, but both needed Mommy at that moment.<br/>
While disappointed that she couldn&#39;t go to the nature trail, Emily<br/>
decided that she could walk down to the local neighborhood park<br/>
instead.  School was still in session and she would have the park to<br/>
herself mostly.  This weekend we made a point of going to the nautre<br/>
trail.  Emily still got her fresh air even though it wasn&#39;t exactly<br/>
what she wanted *and* she eventually got the nature trail as well.<br/>
