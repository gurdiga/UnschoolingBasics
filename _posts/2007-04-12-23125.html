<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655992493">Julian Baptista will be performing a concert, followed by a party, for his  <br/>
&quot;commencement&quot; from unschooling in Salem, Massachusetts on Saturday, May  19th. <br/>
 He will be accompanied for parts of his performance by friends and  teachers <br/>
who have influenced him as a musician, including his band,  Geist. Julian <br/>
performs a wide variety of types of music, and it will  include some original <br/>
pieces.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;d like to invite unschoolers and others who are interested to attend.  (If <br/>
you have a reluctant unschooling parent or relative or kid, this might be a  <br/>
nice way to help them understand what unschooling is all about.) <br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;d like an invitation with details, please e-mail me off-list.<br/>
