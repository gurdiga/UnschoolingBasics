<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761596319">Hello! I&#39;ve lurked on this list for a while, have learned so much - thank you all!! Now I am hoping you may have ideas to help our family deal with an issue we&#39;re facing.<br/>
<br/>
Our son, turned four in Feb, just started having problems with pet-induced asthma late last fall. Since then, we&#39;ve gotten rid of our cats and and have eliminated all prolonged contact with pets other than at his grandparent&#39;s house. He absolutely LOVES to visit and has a very close and special relationship with grandma. The grandparents have a cat. We used to go there weekly, let him spend the night a few times, and now we can barely stay a couple hours before his body starts to react-- and that&#39;s even after grandma does a marathon cleaning session, furnace filter change, open windows, etc. <br/>
<br/>
DS is very, very, very averse to asthma treatment. From the get go, he has fought the inhaler/spacer. The few times we&#39;ve had to administer it, DH and I have struggled to do it even with us both working together to hold him down. At the time we felt it was either that, or else face an ER visit where they&#39;d do similar as he was getting progressively worse. We&#39;ve since gotten a nebulizer, thinking he&#39;d prefer that, but no such luck. <br/>
<br/>
It seems like a violation of his bodily autonomy to hold him down. It makes him miserable, frightened and scared. He freaks out when he even sees the equipment. It makes me extremely upset as well. We try to never manually force or coerce him otherwise, don&#39;t physically take advantage of our size over his, but I&#39;m just not sure what the alternative is when he needs the treatment. And what do I say to him about it?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve tried explaining, but that does not work for a multitude of reasons. We&#39;ve tried to make it less scary for him- got special masks for the nebulizer, let him wear headphones to cover up the noise it makes, etc. He still wants nothing to do with it. Unfortunately, either form of the treatment takes 15-30 mins to kick in, so he doesn&#39;t recognize that it&#39;s the source of his relief. He also does not yet understand the nature of the allergy, why it happens to him. <br/>
<br/>
The only thing that has worked is giving the inhaler to him while he&#39;s sleeping. However we now know that the severity and duration of the attack is less the quicker he gets the treatment. Not always feasible to wait for sleep if the attack happens at a non-sleepy time. <br/>
<br/>
One time we tried medicating in advance for the allergy and it did not work. He was against that too, but finally took the liquid in juice. <br/>
<br/>
Avoidance has really been the best thing, and he doesn&#39;t seem to have any issues at all if not around animals (no maintenance meds and no other triggers). <br/>
<br/>
But lately he&#39;s started begging to go to their house. Them coming to ours does not suffice. And going there and staying for a short time has also not been working out. He wants to go and stay long enough to do all the fun things they used to do when he came to visit. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to find a way to balance his need to visit with the repurcussions and just generally come up with a better approach to managing this asthma situation. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what else to do and am looking for any and all advice, suggestions, etc. I could greatly use an outside perspective. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Our son, turned four in Feb, just started having problems with <br/>
&gt;&gt; pet-induced asthma late last fall. Since then, we&#39;ve gotten rid of our <br/>
&gt;&gt; cats and and have eliminated all prolonged contact with pets other than <br/>
&gt;&gt; at his grandparent&#39;s house. He absolutely LOVES to visit and has a very <br/>

&gt;&gt; filter change, open windows, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My DH is allergic to cats.  No amount of cleaning the house will help him, <br/>
if his parents (who own a cat) even bring over a book or a set of keys that <br/>
have been in the house with the cat, he still reacts.  If your son is having <br/>
problems, is it possible for you to ask the grandparents if they would <br/>
consider giving up their cat?  Not sure if that&#39;s an option or not, but <br/>
worth thinking about.  My mother has chosen not to keep her cat (well, <br/>
actually, it was my sisters, but she has been looking after it for a few <br/>
years), so that my DH feels comfortable visiting.<br/>
<br/>
Another possible option is to go on a vacation with the grandparents? <br/>
Perhaps stay overnight at a hotel or something could be exciting, and a <br/>
possible substitute for staying at the grandparents.<br/>

&gt;&gt; luck. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My DD is also very averse to any kind of treatment for any ailment.  It has <br/>
been quite stressful for me until I realised that if the situation didn&#39;t <br/>
feel badly enough for her to want to take something for it, then it wasn&#39;t <br/>
my right to insist on it.  I&#39;m not sure what symptoms your son is <br/>
exhibiting?  Since you&#39;ve mentioned asthma, I&#39;d assume breathing <br/>
difficulties.  What signs of this are there?  Is your son visibly <br/>
distressed, or is he not bothered by it?<br/>
<br/>
Another possibility is that if the inhaller/spacer is only being introduced <br/>
when he&#39;s having an asthma attack, then he might associate it with the <br/>
attack.  Can you let him play with it at other times?  Play with <br/>
administering it to his toys?  Is it the mask he&#39;s objecting to?  Can you <br/>
use the inhaller without the spacer?  I&#39;ve been an asthmatic all my life, <br/>
and have never used a spacer, even though I know they&#39;re recomended.  I just <br/>
was never comfortable with them.<br/>
<br/>
Another option is some of the non-invastive asthma/allergy treatments.  I <br/>
know there is a tablet form that is given to kids here in Australia, is that <br/>
an option?  It would have to be taken more regularly, and isn&#39;t helpful in <br/>
an attack, but it still might be an option to look at.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; the source of his relief. He also does not yet understand the nature of <br/>
&gt; the allergy, why it happens to him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I get an almost instant relief from my inhaller when I&#39;m having breathing <br/>
difficulties.  I wonder if because he&#39;s fighting it, he isn&#39;t getting an <br/>
effective dose?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; is less the quicker he gets the treatment. Not always feasible to wait for <br/>
&gt; sleep if the attack happens at a non-sleepy time<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So he is able to go to sleep while having an attack, even occasionally? <br/>
That doesn&#39;t sound like it needs treatment to me?  What sort of a reaction <br/>
is he getting?  I&#39;m asking, because my daughter was &#39;diagnosed&#39; as asthmatic <br/>
at around 9 months by a doctor, because her chest recesses when breathing. <br/>
Luckily I wasn&#39;t convinced, and we consulted a paedatrician, who disagreed <br/>
with the diagnosis.  My daughter is now 6.5, and has never shown any <br/>
convincing signs of asthma, though her chest still does recess when <br/>
breathing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163690420">Bribery was a good technique for us when Simon was on a series of antibiotics <br/>
when he was 3 or so. I set up an advent calendar sort of thing where every time <br/>
he took his dose for the day he would get a toy from the advent calendar. It <br/>
added a moment of pleasure to something that he needed to do. Maybe you could <br/>
have a bunch of things that you know your son would like wrapped up as presents <br/>
at his grandparents so that if he needs the nebulizer you can give him the <br/>
present as a straight bribe for using it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My mom has asthma and has a breathing exercise/toy sort of thing with a ball in <br/>
it where she blows into an inhaler like opening and the ball rises on her breath <br/>
(it may have been a respiratory exerciser, it may have just been a peak flow <br/>
meter). Maybe you could get something like that for your son to play with when <br/>
he wasn&#39;t having an asthma attack so that he could acclimate to the experience <br/>
more. I imagine that in the middle of an attack he&#39;s fairly stressed out and <br/>
that it is much harder for him to be calm in the face of more things that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t like. If the equipment and the treatment is something that seems more a <br/>
part of everyday things it may be easier for him to use the nebulizer or <br/>
inhaler. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In my imaginings my best case scenario of forcing my little 4 year old Simon to <br/>
use an asthma inhaler would have me saying calmly &quot;You need this medication to <br/>
help you to breathe,&quot; forcing him to use it and then moving on to something <br/>
else. If Simon was resistant to the use of something that he needed to breathe I <br/>
would give it anyhow. In the moments when he didn&#39;t need it I would look for <br/>
things to make it easier for him to trust me on this one as well as preparing <br/>
him for it&#39;s later use. Play with blowing bubbles or blowing up balloons, maybe <br/>
take a baby bugs yoga class where they do calming, breathing techniques, talk <br/>
about breathing to calm down, deep breath in, slow breath out. And talk about <br/>
why he has the allergies at grandma&#39;s and grandpa&#39;s house. Talk about the kitty <br/>
and how her skin and hair sometimes makes it hard for him to breathe and that <br/>
when he&#39;s having trouble breathing you need to make it easier for him with the <br/>
nebulizer. Ask him what would make it easier for him to use it. See if you and <br/>
he could put cool stickers on it or a funny set of lips or paint it or use <br/>
Sharpies to decorate it. Make it more playful and less threatening. Talk about <br/>
going and getting a treat when he&#39;s used the nebulizer or inhaler when he needed <br/>
it. Go get ice cream afterwards or a toy or anything, use the wrapped presents I <br/>
suggested. Do anything you can to make it as pleasant as possible without <br/>
getting too stressed out when he needs it. And if he won&#39;t use it, move through <br/>
the point of forcing him as quickly and as unemotionally as possible, and then <br/>
go and get the treat or the present or the whatever. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and with the peak flow meter, if you have the wherewithal, you can show him <br/>
how the nebulizer worked. Have him check his peak flow before using the <br/>
nebulizer and then take it afterwards. Talk about the experiment as you do it, <br/>
if he&#39;s interested. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528592773">i have a similar situation. my son is 3 and started needing asthma treatments a few months ago. the first treatment was at the doctor&#39;s office and it was a struggle. our room must have sounded like a full blown torture chamber for a good 20-30 minutes, i was mortified. there is nothing harder than having to force something on our kids and having to use our strength to overpower them, but somethimes we have to keep thinking its whats best for them.<br/>
it took my son a good dozen times of using the breathing machine by force, to get comfortable with it. he loves Thomas the Tank and his sister told him it was a &quot;Murdock Machine&quot;. silly i k now, but it worked for him.<br/>
on another note, ever since he first got his first teeth, i have been trying to brush his teeth! he wil not let me for the life of him. no matter what! We have tried everything! i have to roll him up in a towel, tight, with his arms down and basically &quot;sit&quot; on him and have to pry his little lips open. needless to say, his poor teeth don&#39;t get a good brushin very often. its not fun and i absolutely hate it!!! i dont know what to do about it. it kills me to have to overpower him that way, but otherwise his teeth may suffer dramatically.<br/>
his dad&#39;s cousin used to be that way and had to go to a special dentist for kids like that! i wonder if that genetic?? oh dear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957255339">With the warmer weather arriving, can most of the visit to grandma&#39;s be outdoor playtime - it sounds like grandma is trying really hard to help (heavy cleaning and such) so maybe y&#39;all can work together to stock up on really attractive outdoor playthings that&#39;ll keep your DS from spending much time inside where the cat problem is severe. Picnic meals, sand toys, shovels, balls, and the like are great outdoor ideas. For that matter, a good patio table can be a place for coloring, games, and such to happen as well<br/>
<br/>
In another vein, regular washing can sometimes help neutralize the cat dander - yes, I&#39;m suggesting washing a cat (LOL). Back many years ago now, I rescued a stray cat (it was huddled on a friend&#39;s car engine trying to stay warm as the car was off at the time). She had critters of various sorts which required daily bathing with anti-critter shampoo. Granted, she was a wee kitty at the time which made it easier. But, once the nasty critters were gone, I continued to bath her once a week (even though she was totally an indoor cat). Friends of mine who were/are cat allergic had a much easier time of it visiting if I kept up with the cat washing, so I did. She wasn&#39;t all that happy with it but habit had taught her that (a) sitting still and tolerating it got things done faster (b) she&#39;d get a treat afterward (c) she could &#39;take revenge&#39; by sitting her damp self on my pillow :- ) She got weekly baths until we had to give her away (to the ILs) because of our housing situation; she was about 8 at the time).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I second this.  We have 5 cats, and after adopting 5 of them (first 2, which<br/>
was fine, then 3 more from another litter) our allergies went into<br/>
overdrive.  We&#39;ve found lots of little things that help within our house.<br/>
 Washing them was one of the most helpful.  In our case it&#39;s monthly, or<br/>
every other week, and it&#39;s a routine we have.  Each of them gets their claws<br/>
clipped, followed by a bath.  After they all dry we go down the line doing<br/>
the once a month flea treatment (even though they&#39;re indoor cats).<br/>
<br/>
We also dust mop daily (all of the cat areas are tile), change sheets twice<br/>
a week, dust and mop weekly as well as vacuum the one room that has carpet<br/>
(which the cats don&#39;t go in).  We also change our a/c filter twice a month.<br/>
<br/>
They may want to try changing their AC filter the day before you come, or<br/>
even 48 hours before you come, because it&#39;ll do a better job at moving the<br/>
air around and pulling cat dander out of the air.<br/>
<br/>
I know for 24 hours after we dust things are actually worse instead of<br/>
better until everything settles again so they may want to take that into<br/>
consideration when timing cleaning.<br/>

Teeth actually aren&#39;t the equivalent of breath. And there are lots of different <br/>
ways to approach teeth care than just brushing. Joyce has a page about brushing <br/>
teeth that might give you more ideas than sitting on your son: <br/>

on another note, ever since he first got his first teeth, i have been trying to <br/>
brush his teeth! he wil not let me for the life of him. no matter what! We have <br/>
tried everything! i have to roll him up in a towel, tight, with his arms down <br/>
and basically &quot;sit&quot; on him and have to pry his little lips open. needless to <br/>
say, his poor teeth don&#39;t get a good brushin very often. its not fun and i <br/>
absolutely hate it!!! i dont know what to do about it. it kills me to have to <br/>
overpower him that way, but otherwise his teeth may suffer dramatically. <br/>
<br/>
his dad&#39;s cousin used to be that way and had to go to a special dentist for kids <br/>
<br/>
like that! i wonder if that genetic?? oh dear.<br/>

That opens up the door to rinses, gargling (a big hit with many kids), tongue scrapers, xylitol gum and other &quot;cleansing foods&quot; like cheese. Even with teeth, there&#39;s the option of having adult teeth sealed as they come in to protect them. <br/>

Also my asmatic just turned 8 and just recently has been able to express to my just how badly the medicine from the asthma treatment makes her feel. From what she describes its equivelant to an adult having an axiety attack. <br/>

For some kids, a daily allergy treatment like claritan or singulair helps. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Our son, turned four in Feb, just started having problems with <br/>
&gt;&gt; pet-induced asthma late last fall. Since then, we&#39;ve gotten rid of our <br/>
&gt;&gt; cats and and have eliminated all prolonged contact with pets other than <br/>
&gt;&gt; at his grandparent&#39;s house. He absolutely LOVES to visit and has a very <br/>
&gt;&gt; close and special relationship with grandma. The grandparents have a cat. <br/>
&gt;&gt; We used to go there weekly, let him spend the night a few times, and now <br/>
&gt;&gt; we can barely stay a couple hours before his body starts to react-- and <br/>
&gt;&gt; that&#39;s even after grandma does a marathon cleaning session, furnace <br/>
&gt;&gt; filter change, open windows, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My DH is allergic to cats. No amount of cleaning the house will help him, <br/>
if his parents (who own a cat) even bring over a book or a set of keys that <br/>
have been in the house with the cat, he still reacts. If your son is having <br/>
problems, is it possible for you to ask the grandparents if they would <br/>
consider giving up their cat? Not sure if that&#39;s an option or not, but <br/>
worth thinking about. My mother has chosen not to keep her cat (well, <br/>
actually, it was my sisters, but she has been looking after it for a few <br/>
years), so that my DH feels comfortable visiting.<br/>
<br/>
Another possible option is to go on a vacation with the grandparents? <br/>
Perhaps stay overnight at a hotel or something could be exciting, and a <br/>
possible substitute for staying at the grandparents.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; DS is very, very, very averse to asthma treatment. From the get go, he <br/>
&gt;&gt; has fought the inhaler/spacer. The few times we&#39;ve had to administer it, <br/>
&gt;&gt; DH and I have struggled to do it even with us both working together to <br/>
&gt;&gt; hold him down. At the time we felt it was either that, or else face an ER <br/>
&gt;&gt; visit where they&#39;d do similar as he was getting progressively worse. <br/>
&gt;&gt; We&#39;ve since gotten a nebulizer, thinking he&#39;d prefer that, but no such <br/>
&gt;&gt; luck. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My DD is also very averse to any kind of treatment for any ailment. It has <br/>
been quite stressful for me until I realised that if the situation didn&#39;t <br/>
feel badly enough for her to want to take something for it, then it wasn&#39;t <br/>
my right to insist on it. I&#39;m not sure what symptoms your son is <br/>
exhibiting? Since you&#39;ve mentioned asthma, I&#39;d assume breathing <br/>
difficulties. What signs of this are there? Is your son visibly <br/>
distressed, or is he not bothered by it?<br/>
<br/>
Another possibility is that if the inhaller/spacer is only being introduced <br/>
when he&#39;s having an asthma attack, then he might associate it with the <br/>
attack. Can you let him play with it at other times? Play with <br/>
administering it to his toys? Is it the mask he&#39;s objecting to? Can you <br/>
use the inhaller without the spacer? I&#39;ve been an asthmatic all my life, <br/>
and have never used a spacer, even though I know they&#39;re recomended. I just <br/>
was never comfortable with them.<br/>
<br/>
Another option is some of the non-invastive asthma/allergy treatments. I <br/>
know there is a tablet form that is given to kids here in Australia, is that <br/>
an option? It would have to be taken more regularly, and isn&#39;t helpful in <br/>
an attack, but it still might be an option to look at.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve tried explaining, but that does not work for a multitude of reasons. <br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve tried to make it less scary for him- got special masks for the <br/>
&gt; nebulizer, let him wear headphones to cover up the noise it makes, etc. He <br/>
&gt; still wants nothing to do with it. Unfortunately, either form of the <br/>
&gt; treatment takes 15-30 mins to kick in, so he doesn&#39;t recognize that it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; the source of his relief. He also does not yet understand the nature of <br/>
&gt; the allergy, why it happens to him.<br/>
<br/>
I get an almost instant relief from my inhaller when I&#39;m having breathing <br/>
difficulties. I wonder if because he&#39;s fighting it, he isn&#39;t getting an <br/>
effective dose?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only thing that has worked is giving the inhaler to him while he&#39;s <br/>
&gt; sleeping. However we now know that the severity and duration of the attack <br/>
&gt; is less the quicker he gets the treatment. Not always feasible to wait for <br/>
&gt; sleep if the attack happens at a non-sleepy time<br/>
<br/>
So he is able to go to sleep while having an attack, even occasionally? <br/>
That doesn&#39;t sound like it needs treatment to me? What sort of a reaction <br/>
is he getting? I&#39;m asking, because my daughter was &#39;diagnosed&#39; as asthmatic <br/>
at around 9 months by a doctor, because her chest recesses when breathing. <br/>
Luckily I wasn&#39;t convinced, and we consulted a paedatrician, who disagreed <br/>
with the diagnosis. My daughter is now 6.5, and has never shown any <br/>
convincing signs of asthma, though her chest still does recess when <br/>
breathing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327149396">Two things come to mind.<br/>
<br/>
Spacers and nebulisers ARE scary - they cover the face and even if you&#39;re able to breathe you can feel as if you&#39;re going to suffocate.<br/>
Have you tried playing with all the kit  - doctors and nurses, taking it in turns to be the patient etc etc when he does not have an attack? You can pretend to be very ill and magically get better with the inhaler/nebuliser and then talk to him about that&#39;s how it works etc. But mainly just to play with it over each others faces. Do silly faces, silly voices. You get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
The other idea is that ventolin does come in tablet form - at least it used to. Maybe you can grind them up in honey or something. Tablets take longer to work than inhaler/neb but are less invasive than a trip to the hospital.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126968007">I have asthma  and sometimes I choose to not use the inhaler  for a little <br/>
difficulty breathing and it goes away.<br/>
I like the idea of meeting grandma someone fun! A hotel with a water park or <br/>
pool?<br/>
Another thing is that you should use the inhaler *before* you go into grandma&#39;s <br/>
house, before the attack.<br/>
would he b e willing to do it so he can visit grandma?<br/>
Is he on allergy medications too? The doctor can help with that.<br/>
If I start to fold laundry I start getting a sore throat, then sneezing and then <br/>
I start wheezing.<br/>
If I do it 2 days in a row it can get so uncomfortable that I do use the <br/>
inhaler. I try not ot use it for when I can still handle<br/>
the wheezing. But if I use an allergy medication and the inhaler before I can go <br/>
ahead and fold laundry!<br/>
Yep I am really allergic to folding laundry, you should have seen <br/>
my mother-in-law&#39;s face when  my mom was folding my laundry and telling her <br/>
that!<br/>
She said; &quot;Yeah ,right!&quot;<br/>
I know attacks cannot be predicted but one thing is for sure, feeling calm helps <br/>
tremendously and being anxious  can get you a full blown attack.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157361592">Ok Dears, Dearest Dears<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have personal experience of asthma. But I read and heard a lot around it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1)     It was often suggested that dehydration is very influential in causing asmathic<br/>
attacks. So getting hydrated with &#39;good&#39; water seems to be very helpful. <br/>
<br/>
2)     Then I heard and experienced myself that people get major relief using EFT in<br/>
allergic situations (or TAT or other energy psychology technics). Find a reliable EFT<br/>
practitioner near you or on the WWW who uses Skype or some other chat mode (or telephone<br/>
sessions)  and do a session with them. I could stand in, too, though my timing is a little<br/>
bit obscure living in Namibia.<br/>
<br/>
3)     If you live near a nuclear power plant  (100 mile radius is good enough) I would<br/>
suggest that you do everything to get yourself and your loved ones cleared of radiation as<br/>
soon as possible. This seems to be a major contributor to many issues we experience all<br/>
over the world.<br/>
<br/>
4)     Forcing medication that is prescribed by the energetically illiterate medical<br/>
society seems to be a great issue with unschoolers, too.<br/>
<br/>
I find that following my grandchildren&#39;s wishes about &#39;how they want to treat their<br/>
maladies&#39; works best every time. They KNOW! They know what they need and what their body<br/>
needs. Listen to your child!!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Maybe all of this sounds &#39;out there&#39; but I personally think that unschooling is enough out<br/>
there to varant alternative ways to look at things and to handle situations in an<br/>
unconventional way, too.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I had a situation where friends of my friend&#39;s daughters visited our home, filled with<br/>
cats, and they were getting into panic mode within minutes. We &#39;tapped&#39; (using EFT) and<br/>
they could cuddle the nearest cat with ZERO symptoms within 10 minutes. I find it so<br/>
unsettling that so many people go to so many lengths - washing cats, dusting and vacuuming<br/>
etc - when the CAUSE is not looked at. EFT provides one way to look at the cause (which<br/>
could be emotional) and neutralise its effects. And if radiation is the cause (not only<br/>
the Fukushima stuff floating around but from the bomb tests in 1963 and more recently and<br/>
chemtrails and haarp) then there are quite a number of ways to get our DNA up to scratch<br/>
again, too.  google it - it is out there. and it could be child friendly, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509661547">Thanks for the replies everyone. To answer a few questions in particular, and also help me think through this more:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If your son is having problems, is it possible for you to ask the grandparents if they would consider giving up their cat?  Not sure if that&#39;s an option or not, but worth thinking about.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, this is not at option. Grandpa is very attached to the cat, and I truly believe it would affect his mental well being if we were to request they give it up. It would also be a cause of friction between the two grandparents. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My DD is also very averse to any kind of treatment for any ailment.  It has been quite stressful for me until I realised that if the situation didn&#39;t feel badly enough for her to want to take something for it, then it wasn&#39;t my right to insist on it.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re fortunate that our son is rarely sick and has never needed meds prior to this. We&#39;ve occasionally tried to give him stuff before, like Benadryl when he got hives from a dog licking him. He resisted so we didn&#39;t push it because it wasn&#39;t necessary. The difference here is that it&#39;s hard for me to figure out when the wheezing is going to progress into a more serious situation (it doesn&#39;t always, sometimes will just clear up with time after we leave the allergen). When is it really necessary?<br/>
<br/>
What we had been doing is listen to his lungs, measure his levels with an oximeter, and hold off on treatment unless the numbers really dropped. However, what we&#39;ve been told multiple times now is that if we give treatment early, they won&#39;t drop at all. Basically, it stops the attack in it&#39;s tracks and may make further treatment unnecessary.  But I really don&#39;t want to go through this traumatic process if it&#39;s not going to progress! <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not sure what symptoms your son is <br/>
&gt; exhibiting?  Since you&#39;ve mentioned asthma, I&#39;d assume breathing <br/>
&gt; difficulties.  What signs of this are there?  Is your son visibly <br/>
&gt; distressed, or is he not bothered by it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>His symptoms have been typical allergy symptoms that progress to breathing difficulties. Eyes get itchy, nose starts to run, coughing starts. His oxygen stats drop and you can hear the wheezing, squeaking sound in his lungs develop and get worse. It&#39;s never gotten to the point of extreme breathing difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s rarely bothered by anything as long as things are going his way, and has been this way since an infant. His attacks aren&#39;t severe, but when the sat scores get down in the low 90s, this concerns me. My understanding is that it&#39;s bad for the brain and other organs once you get below 92 or so.<br/>
<br/>
I have had several doctors, as well as other parents, tell me that some kids will act fine until they just collapse. This possibility scares me. I don&#39;t like making decisions based on fear, but have a hard time being OK with letting his symptoms progress past a certain point now due to this. It seems irresponsible. However, it also feels totally wrong to me to force treatment. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I get an almost instant relief from my inhaller when I&#39;m having breathing difficulties.  I wonder if because he&#39;s fighting it, he isn&#39;t getting an effective dose?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is part of it, but it&#39;s also just how his body reacts. The first time he was ever treated (last fall) at a quick care center, they gave him a treatment and waited. His sat scores didn&#39;t improve right away so they gave him another, still not working, so they sent us to the ER. By the time we got there and in (about 30 mins later), he had recovered to 99%! They acted like we were silly for bringing him in and couldn&#39;t even hear anything wrong with his lungs, when just prior they had sounded atrocious. The doctors told us that for some people, it can take 30 mins for it to take effect. We know it does work though, as you can hear the audible wheezing go away. It&#39;s just not immediate so I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s making the connection, or maybe he just doesn&#39;t feel the trade off is worth it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So he is able to go to sleep while having an attack, even occasionally? That doesn&#39;t sound like it needs treatment to me?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, he continues normal life when he&#39;s having an attack, even when his sats drop to low 90s. If it gets really bad, he&#39;ll settle down his activity level, perhaps ask to lay down, and ask for water. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Another possibility is that if the inhaller/spacer is only being introduced when he&#39;s having an asthma attack, then he might associate it with the  attack.  Can you let him play with it at other times?  Play with administering it to his toys?  Is it the mask he&#39;s objecting to?  Can you use the inhaller without the spacer?  I&#39;ve been an asthmatic all my life, and have never used a spacer, even though I know they&#39;re recomended.  I just was never comfortable with them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve let him play with the spacer part, even let him blow a few puffs on the inhaler into the air. He&#39;s fine with it, up until it comes time to actually administer it. I know he says it tastes bad, and DH remembers from asthma treatment as a child that he always thought that too.  If it were just a quick shot and done he might be better with it. With the spacer, you have to keep it on for several breaths. He really hates things touch his face without being in control, so that likely makes it worse. The doctors suggested it because you don&#39;t have to take the deep breath to inhale it all at once, can just take regular breaths which is meant to be easier for little kids. Will have to investigate the possibility of just giving it directly to someone uncooperative, what that would mean and how we might do it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Another option is some of the non-invastive asthma/allergy treatments.  I know there is a tablet form that is given to kids here in Australia, is that an option?  It would have to be taken more regularly, and isn&#39;t helpful in an attack, but it still might be an option to look at.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have been hesitant to introduce daily meds for something that is only of concern every once in a while. The systemic affects, cost, etc. just seem an unacceptable trade off. Plus we would also have to consider that give his resistance to any kind of treatment it might turn into a struggle there too.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Have you looked into the GAPS diet at all to heal the asthma?... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, again because it&#39;s been infrequent. That seems extreme given how often this has been of concern, and that it is largely controllable through avoidance. Perhaps I need to reconsider this given our son&#39;s more frequent requests to visit.<br/>
<br/>
Since he had the initial attack in late September, it&#39;s been an issue perhaps 10-20 times, and maybe 5 times have things progressed to the point we&#39;ve had to give the treatment. Only twice has it been bad enough we&#39;ve had to give more than one dose. If we can avoid pets, we just do not need it at all. Nothing but dogs and cats seem to trigger it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-344689400">When my youngest (now 4.5) was about 18 months old we moved from New Mexico<br/>
to Oregon. She went from not having asthma to having asthma & needing daily<br/>
medications. She was hospitalized 2x within 5 months of our arrival and it<br/>
was traumatic for all of us. She still goes to the ER at least 2x a year and<br/>
we deal with asthma flare-ups every other month or so. She has a rescue<br/>
inhaler with a spacer and she also needs a daily inhaled steroid.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to give a nebulizer to a kid who doesn&#39;t want one is so hard! It is<br/>
loud and annoying, so I really tried to save it as a last resort. The rescue<br/>
inhaler works faster anyway. I used to do &quot;blow-bys&quot; (hold the mask above<br/>
her face while she sleeps or direct the nozzle at her) on Zoe when she was<br/>
younger and sleeping. It only worked when she was sleeping deeply, but<br/>
effective. She used to hate the nebulizer, but we used headphones, cartoons,<br/>
special toys...I&#39;ve even fed her M&M&#39;s through the mask while she uses it.<br/>
There were times when she was younger when she&#39;d only take a little bit of<br/>
the nebulizer and we&#39;d come back to it several times during the day. Having<br/>
her say funny things while she&#39;s using the nebulizer was helpful too. &quot;Luke,<br/>
I am your father.&quot; sounds pretty funny through a mask. We used to sing<br/>
songs, do puzzles...anything to &quot;normalize&quot; the nebulizer.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s added stickers to her spacer and we let her play with an extra one<br/>
whenever she wants. Having autonomy over when she uses it has been really<br/>
helpful. Obviously, there are times when it just has to be used - in those<br/>
instances, I&#39;ll say something like &quot;let&#39;s use your inhaler and then go do<br/>
this cool thing&quot;. But if at all possible, I let her decide if she needs it.<br/>
I&#39;m also trying to share as much information with her as possible, so I<br/>
might say something like &quot;it sounds like you are wheezing(or coughing or<br/>
short of breath), if you use your inhaler you might breathe easier.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One other thing - I know how scary the wheezing can sound. When they were<br/>
little, I&#39;d stay up all night watching them (both of my kids have asthma and<br/>
they usually have flare-ups at the same time) breathe and listening to the<br/>
wheeze. We bought a home oxygen sensor that measures the percent of oxygen<br/>
in your blood...it goes on your finger, takes seconds to read and doesn&#39;t<br/>
hurt. I think it cost about $80. Having that visual information about how<br/>
she&#39;s breathing has been a huge relief to me. Our doctor wants us to bring<br/>
her into the ER if her O2 sats get to 93 or lower. But she can sound wheezy<br/>
at 98 (which is a normal oxygen level).<br/>

&gt; DS is very, very, very averse to asthma treatment. From the get go, he has<br/>
&gt; fought the inhaler/spacer. The few times we&#39;ve had to administer it, DH and<br/>
&gt; I have struggled to do it even with us both working together to hold him<br/>
&gt; down. At the time we felt it was either that, or else face an ER visit where<br/>
&gt; they&#39;d do similar as he was getting progressively worse. We&#39;ve since gotten<br/>
&gt; a nebulizer, thinking he&#39;d prefer that, but no such luck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It seems like a violation of his bodily autonomy to hold him down. It makes<br/>
&gt; him miserable, frightened and scared. He freaks out when he even sees the<br/>
&gt; equipment. It makes me extremely upset as well. We try to never manually<br/>
&gt; force or coerce him otherwise, don&#39;t physically take advantage of our size<br/>
&gt; over his, but I&#39;m just not sure what the alternative is when he needs the<br/>
&gt; treatment. And what do I say to him about it?<br/>

Ok Dears, Dearest Dears<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have personal experience of asthma. But I read and heard a lot around it.<br/>
<br/>
1) It was often suggested that dehydration is very influential in causing asmathic<br/>
attacks. So getting hydrated with &#39;good&#39; water seems to be very helpful. <br/>
<br/>
2) Then I heard and experienced myself that people get major relief using EFT in<br/>
allergic situations (or TAT or other energy psychology technics). Find a reliable EFT<br/>
practitioner near you or on the WWW who uses Skype or some other chat mode (or telephone<br/>
sessions) and do a session with them. I could stand in, too, though my timing is a little<br/>
bit obscure living in Namibia.<br/>
<br/>
3) If you live near a nuclear power plant (100 mile radius is good enough) I would<br/>
suggest that you do everything to get yourself and your loved ones cleared of radiation as<br/>
soon as possible. This seems to be a major contributor to many issues we experience all<br/>
over the world.<br/>
<br/>
4) Forcing medication that is prescribed by the energetically illiterate medical<br/>
society seems to be a great issue with unschoolers, too.<br/>
<br/>
I find that following my grandchildren&#39;s wishes about &#39;how they want to treat their<br/>
maladies&#39; works best every time. They KNOW! They know what they need and what their body<br/>
needs. Listen to your child!!!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe all of this sounds &#39;out there&#39; but I personally think that unschooling is enough out<br/>
there to varant alternative ways to look at things and to handle situations in an<br/>
unconventional way, too.<br/>
<br/>
I had a situation where friends of my friend&#39;s daughters visited our home, filled with<br/>
cats, and they were getting into panic mode within minutes. We &#39;tapped&#39; (using EFT) and<br/>
they could cuddle the nearest cat with ZERO symptoms within 10 minutes. I find it so<br/>
unsettling that so many people go to so many lengths - washing cats, dusting and vacuuming<br/>
etc - when the CAUSE is not looked at. EFT provides one way to look at the cause (which<br/>
could be emotional) and neutralise its effects. And if radiation is the cause (not only<br/>
the Fukushima stuff floating around but from the bomb tests in 1963 and more recently and<br/>
chemtrails and haarp) then there are quite a number of ways to get our DNA up to scratch<br/>
again, too. google it - it is out there. and it could be child friendly, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-717755389">I don&#39;t know anything about asthma but I have some advice about what needs to be thought through most of all: the assumptions. I suggest figuring out how a mom can say upsetting Grandpa and causing metaphorical &quot;friction&quot; in an adult relationship is unacceptable so upsetting a four-year-old and causing extreme phsyical and emotional stress in his relationship with his mom, is just what has to be done.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the replies everyone. To answer a few questions in particular, and also help me think through this more:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If your son is having problems, is it possible for you to ask the grandparents if they would consider giving up their cat?  Not sure if that&#39;s an option or not, but worth thinking about.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, this is not at option. Grandpa is very attached to the cat, and I truly believe it would affect his mental well being if we were to request they give it up. It would also be a cause of friction between the two grandparents. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My DD is also very averse to any kind of treatment for any ailment.  It has been quite stressful for me until I realised that if the situation didn&#39;t feel badly enough for her to want to take something for it, then it wasn&#39;t my right to insist on it.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;re fortunate that our son is rarely sick and has never needed meds prior to this. We&#39;ve occasionally tried to give him stuff before, like Benadryl when he got hives from a dog licking him. He resisted so we didn&#39;t push it because it wasn&#39;t necessary. The difference here is that it&#39;s hard for me to figure out when the wheezing is going to progress into a more serious situation (it doesn&#39;t always, sometimes will just clear up with time after we leave the allergen). When is it really necessary?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What we had been doing is listen to his lungs, measure his levels with an oximeter, and hold off on treatment unless the numbers really dropped. However, what we&#39;ve been told multiple times now is that if we give treatment early, they won&#39;t drop at all. Basically, it stops the attack in it&#39;s tracks and may make further treatment unnecessary.  But I really don&#39;t want to go through this traumatic process if it&#39;s not going to progress! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure what symptoms your son is <br/>
&gt; &gt; exhibiting?  Since you&#39;ve mentioned asthma, I&#39;d assume breathing <br/>
&gt; &gt; difficulties.  What signs of this are there?  Is your son visibly <br/>
&gt; &gt; distressed, or is he not bothered by it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; His symptoms have been typical allergy symptoms that progress to breathing difficulties. Eyes get itchy, nose starts to run, coughing starts. His oxygen stats drop and you can hear the wheezing, squeaking sound in his lungs develop and get worse. It&#39;s never gotten to the point of extreme breathing difficulty.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s rarely bothered by anything as long as things are going his way, and has been this way since an infant. His attacks aren&#39;t severe, but when the sat scores get down in the low 90s, this concerns me. My understanding is that it&#39;s bad for the brain and other organs once you get below 92 or so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have had several doctors, as well as other parents, tell me that some kids will act fine until they just collapse. This possibility scares me. I don&#39;t like making decisions based on fear, but have a hard time being OK with letting his symptoms progress past a certain point now due to this. It seems irresponsible. However, it also feels totally wrong to me to force treatment. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I get an almost instant relief from my inhaller when I&#39;m having breathing difficulties.  I wonder if because he&#39;s fighting it, he isn&#39;t getting an effective dose?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That is part of it, but it&#39;s also just how his body reacts. The first time he was ever treated (last fall) at a quick care center, they gave him a treatment and waited. His sat scores didn&#39;t improve right away so they gave him another, still not working, so they sent us to the ER. By the time we got there and in (about 30 mins later), he had recovered to 99%! They acted like we were silly for bringing him in and couldn&#39;t even hear anything wrong with his lungs, when just prior they had sounded atrocious. The doctors told us that for some people, it can take 30 mins for it to take effect. We know it does work though, as you can hear the audible wheezing go away. It&#39;s just not immediate so I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s making the connection, or maybe he just doesn&#39;t feel the trade off is worth it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So he is able to go to sleep while having an attack, even occasionally? That doesn&#39;t sound like it needs treatment to me?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, he continues normal life when he&#39;s having an attack, even when his sats drop to low 90s. If it gets really bad, he&#39;ll settle down his activity level, perhaps ask to lay down, and ask for water. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Another possibility is that if the inhaller/spacer is only being introduced when he&#39;s having an asthma attack, then he might associate it with the  attack.  Can you let him play with it at other times?  Play with administering it to his toys?  Is it the mask he&#39;s objecting to?  Can you use the inhaller without the spacer?  I&#39;ve been an asthmatic all my life, and have never used a spacer, even though I know they&#39;re recomended.  I just was never comfortable with them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve let him play with the spacer part, even let him blow a few puffs on the inhaler into the air. He&#39;s fine with it, up until it comes time to actually administer it. I know he says it tastes bad, and DH remembers from asthma treatment as a child that he always thought that too.  If it were just a quick shot and done he might be better with it. With the spacer, you have to keep it on for several breaths. He really hates things touch his face without being in control, so that likely makes it worse. The doctors suggested it because you don&#39;t have to take the deep breath to inhale it all at once, can just take regular breaths which is meant to be easier for little kids. Will have to investigate the possibility of just giving it directly to someone uncooperative, what that would mean and how we might do it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Another option is some of the non-invastive asthma/allergy treatments.  I know there is a tablet form that is given to kids here in Australia, is that an option?  It would have to be taken more regularly, and isn&#39;t helpful in an attack, but it still might be an option to look at.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been hesitant to introduce daily meds for something that is only of concern every once in a while. The systemic affects, cost, etc. just seem an unacceptable trade off. Plus we would also have to consider that give his resistance to any kind of treatment it might turn into a struggle there too.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Have you looked into the GAPS diet at all to heal the asthma?... <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, again because it&#39;s been infrequent. That seems extreme given how often this has been of concern, and that it is largely controllable through avoidance. Perhaps I need to reconsider this given our son&#39;s more frequent requests to visit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since he had the initial attack in late September, it&#39;s been an issue perhaps 10-20 times, and maybe 5 times have things progressed to the point we&#39;ve had to give the treatment. Only twice has it been bad enough we&#39;ve had to give more than one dose. If we can avoid pets, we just do not need it at all. Nothing but dogs and cats seem to trigger it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371458336">ok Im a bit confused ...You expect someone to automatically get rid of a beloved pet from their own house?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect people to rearrange their house to keep everything dangerous, breakable and spillable from my autistic son , or clear their house of anything he can&#39;t eat but might get a hold of , or smile happily while he jumps on their beds and rips off all the sheets and trys to help himself to everything in their cabinets. <br/>
<br/>
It would be nice and life would be easier if the pet was gone yes but I thinking compromising so both parties are content would be better for everyone.<br/>

I suggest figuring out how a mom can say upsetting Grandpa and causing metaphorical &quot;friction&quot; in an adult relationship is unacceptable so upsetting a four-year-old and causing extreme phsyical and emotional stress in his relationship with his mom, is just what has to be done.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the replies everyone. To answer a few questions in particular, and also help me think through this more:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If your son is having problems, is it possible for you to ask the grandparents if they would consider giving up their cat?  Not sure if that&#39;s an option or not, but worth thinking about.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, this is not at option. Grandpa is very attached to the cat, and I truly believe it would affect his mental well being if we were to request they give it up. It would also be a cause of friction between the two grandparents. <br/>

&gt; ok Im a bit confused ...You expect someone to automatically get rid of a beloved pet from their own house?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t expect people to rearrange their house to keep everything dangerous, breakable and spillable from my autistic son , or clear their house of anything he can&#39;t eat but might get a hold of , or smile happily while he jumps on their beds and rips off all the sheets and trys to help himself to everything in their cabinets. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It would be nice and life would be easier if the pet was gone yes but I thinking compromising so both parties are content would be better for everyone.<br/>

&gt; Again, this is just striking: &quot;Yes, I need to get better with that. It doesn&#39;t help at all for me to be upset about it too. I just wasn&#39;t sure how to get across that we have to do this, it&#39;s not something I want to do. It seems so unsympathetic. &quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925607633">Just a couple of thoughts which may or may not help - have you tried &#39;brainstorming&#39; with your son about this dilemma? See if he can come up with or decide upon a solution (or a combination) including any of the ideas from this list to see if any appeal? You could have a long term and short term plan. Whatever would give him back control of his body, but ensure safety too. I could imagine that meeting his Grandparents in a special place away from their home might be a very fun short term solution, as previously suggested on this list. And it could fill in maybe while finding an alternative treatment for a longer term solution. That&#39;s just a thought. You could (together) map out six or seven special places maybe..?<br/>
The long term solution could be anything too - making the inhaler more friendly & less scary - finding an alternative treatment - finding a way for your son to be willing to use it if necessary. The details are your son&#39;s, but I think the important thing in this idea I am presenting is to give him back the reins.<br/>
Also, I second the homeopathy as far as treating a pet allergy, even one as extreme as asthma. Btw, I think diet can also be a factor - I&#39;ve heard about dairy being linked to allergic reactions (but that&#39;s of course a whole new can of worms). (Acupuncture is I believe very helpful too and I think accupressure - but again these may be future options as I&#39;m not sure of the feasibility of a four year old choosing to endure either.)<br/>
<br/>
But the homeopathy it seems would be a really helpful route here since it is effective and non-invasive.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck - please excuse brevity -<br/>
With love,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-351515939">Along the same lines, if the cats&#39; owners are willing to try to switch it to a raw diet it might help a lot. I&#39;ve heard of this helping significantly for a lot of people who have cat allergies. (Plus, it&#39;s a great for the cat too.) Www.rawfedcat.org<br/>
<br/>
Another idea would be to suggest (or offer to pay for) the cat getting professionally groomed. This might be less traumatic than frequent bathing for both cat and owners. I believe there are also wipes that can be used on the cat right before or while you are there to help reduce allergens.<br/>

&gt; &gt; In another vein, regular washing can sometimes help neutralize the cat dander - yes, I&#39;m suggesting washing a cat (LOL).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; :-) I will suggest this to them. Not sure if they&#39;d be willing to do this, but it&#39;s worth asking! </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362646133">Hepa filters were recommended to us, and worked well.<br/>
<br/>
I also highly recommend Dr. Adam Breiner...www.wholebodymedicine.com<br/>
He is in Trumbull, and is lightyears ahead of any other ND we have been to. My son has been under his care for most of his six years. He is a phenomonal doctor, and has state of the art technologies.  Getting to the root of the problem is key, instead of short-term fixes. WHY is the child having this reaction. There are so many factors that can contribute. It would make sense to correct the underlying issue(s), rather than have this be something that he has to endure forever.<br/>
My son has had accupressure with no problem at all, btw.<br/>
There is absolutely no toxicity with homeopathy...no side affects, or other issues that can stem from conventional medicines.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps..we all want the best for our children!   .<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533193832">Naturally, there have been a few suggestions coming through for &quot;alternative&quot; sorts of medicines and treatments. I want to ask that people avoid using abreviations and keep those posts brief and non-judgemental. It&#39;s good to know of alternaives but this isn&#39;t the place to Debate different treatments. I&#39;ve edited some which contained some negative/loaded language and have clarified abreviations where I could. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re posting a link, say something about it, please so folks can decide if they want to go there, not just &quot;check this out, its great!&quot; Also, everyone please note that the moderators may not have time to check all the sites people are recommending, so go at your own risk! <br/>
