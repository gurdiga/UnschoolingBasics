&gt;<br/>
&gt; I want to reply &quot;Don&#39;t ask that question!&quot; ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the surface the simple answer is &quot;Yes, some do.&quot; But *why* is<br/>
&gt; someone asking? And what do they mean by &quot;use&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a child that likes to do math workbooks.  To her they are the<br/>
same as my doing a sudoku puzzle book.  She enjoys the challenge of<br/>
the &quot;puzzles&quot; in the book.  She likes numbers and has never felt<br/>
daunted by mathematics.  I buy her these workbooks when she asks and<br/>
they sit on the &quot;art shelf&quot; in our hobby room right next to the<br/>
coloring books, crayons, balsa wood airplanes, and some modelling<br/>
clay.  They are no more nor less important than anything else on that<br/>
shelf.  For her they are fun and enjoyable.  Is she learning<br/>
something.  Sure.  Am I thrilled?  Sure.  Am I anymore thrilled that<br/>
she is doing a math workbook than if she had chosen to pick up the<br/>
modelling clay and build a tiny graveyard in the style of Tim Burton?<br/>
No.  I&#39;m thrilled, not that she is doing math, but that she is at ease<br/>
in life enough that she knows that I weigh modelling clay to equal the<br/>
same in importance as I do a math workbook (that she asked for).  And<br/>
she will leave the math workbook alone for weeks or sometimes months<br/>
(just like the clay might be left alone for weeks or months).  Then<br/>
one week she might see them again and spend the next few days doing<br/>
nothing but math workbooks.  We might even have to go to the store and<br/>
find more workbooks.  The week after that it might be the modelling<br/>
clay and she is building a giant scene from  Corpse Bride across our<br/>
workdesk.  We might even have to go to the store to find more clay.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do unschoolers use coloring books?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about all unschoolers, but I use coloring books.  I love<br/>
to color.  I love the feel of crayons and the smell of crayons.  I<br/>
love the feel of the somewhat rough coloring pages and the way the<br/>
crayon reacts to different paper textures.  Somewhere in my life I got<br/>
&quot;too old&quot; for coloring.  I&#39;m not sure if it was something that my<br/>
mother said, society said, or just the feeling that other kids might<br/>
look at me oddly if I was coloring with crayons.  My son, otoh, could<br/>
really care less about coloring books.  He would much prefer to have a<br/>
sheet of paper from the recycling pile and color his own thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097569046">I think that&#39;s great, Emily and I both love love love workbooks with  <br/>
puzzles and games. In terms of kids who are still deschooling though,  <br/>
the workbooks are not the best option because it&#39;s not the challenge  <br/>
the child enjoys, it&#39;s the predictability and ease in being able to  <br/>
provide just the right answer.  Does that make sense? So whenever  <br/>
someone asks if unschoolers *can* use workbooks, I always appreciate  <br/>
someone saying *why* do they want them, rather than just &#39;yes&#39; or  <br/>
&#39;no&#39;. KWIM?<br/>
