<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925569025">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just started preparing my next book, a collection of stories on standing up for children in public places.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to hear from anyone who has intervened successfully on behalf of a child in public and would like to submit their story for inclusion in the book. If a story is used, the writer will receive a free copy.<br/>
<br/>
Please send stories to me at jan (AT) naturalchild.org. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
Jan<br/>
