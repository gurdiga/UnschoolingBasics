<div id="ygrps-yiv-49711296">Today was hard.  I have been sick off and on for over a week.  Faith <br/>
was sick before that.  She is upset that we are taking our foster <br/>
puppy to the adopters tomorrow.  She&#39;s been doing rescue for along <br/>
time and knows that we can&#39;t keep it.  She kept two 1 1/2 yrs ago and <br/>
they are turning 2, in a week.  We have 6 dogs.  <br/>
<br/>
The house is a mess, but more then that her trash is all over the <br/>
floors, desk and everywhere.  Yesterday, one of her soda cans ended <br/>
up on my bed and it was half full so mine and my DH husband&#39;s were <br/>
drenched.<br/>
<br/>
I have been picking up after her the best that I can.  I happen to <br/>
have vertigo as part of my issues.  Finally I explained to her today <br/>
that she was creating a safety problems as I couldn&#39;t walk without <br/>
tripping over her things and I can&#39;t pick them up.  <br/>
<br/>
She was receptive and started picking things up.  This has been an on <br/>
going problem as she drops whatever, whereever and we pick up while <br/>
trying to make it fun for her.  <br/>
<br/>
When does this kick in, we have been doing it since she was a baby?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-477313021">Faith will be 10 in April.  I didn&#39;t mean when does this kick in.  I think<br/>
it was my frustration with the situation that caused me to say it.  I am<br/>
back to myself now and have no expectations as to when she will start<br/>
picking up on her own.  We went to the animal shelter today and their was a<br/>
cute pair of ferrets.  I started to fill out the application and part was a<br/>
home visit.  I told her in the car I wasn&#39;t sure we would get them if they<br/>
did the home visit with the wrappers and stuff on the floor.  That I would<br/>
start working on it and get her Dad to help as well.<br/>
