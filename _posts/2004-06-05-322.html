<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295157352">Hi everyone...and a special hello to Christy--good to know there&#39;s at <br/>
least one other Air Force family unschooling! We&#39;re at Andrews AFB in <br/>
Maryland just outside of D.C. Tons of homeschooling families (local <br/>
schools are rotten), but definitely not unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
I want to throw out a couple questions while I have a chance. I&#39;ve <br/>
got two kids with colds and dh is leaving for week tomorrow, so if I <br/>
don&#39;t respond quickly, pls. forgive!<br/>
<br/>
A number of people posted about the healthy snacks their kids choose <br/>
throughout the day. What about sit down meals? It&#39;s vital to me to <br/>
eat breakfast and it sure helps my ds&#39; (3.5) mood if he eats fairly <br/>
soon after waking up. Small meals and snacks throughout the day are <br/>
fine with me, but I sure like the idea of a sit down dinner for the <br/>
family. So I&#39;m curious what unschooling families do--skip big sit <br/>
down big meals, have them completely optional, etc. <br/>
<br/>
For the people here who have changed from controling to not, I&#39;d love <br/>
to hear about your pace! I&#39;m trying to figure out whether I want to <br/>
take small steps I&#39;m comfortable with, or push myself. With dh out of <br/>
town for a week, I really could loosen up even more about food <br/>
quickly, but it&#39;s scary! <br/>
<br/>
Regarding changing spouse&#39;s minds about controling and unschooling, <br/>
I&#39;ve found that the direct method doesn&#39;t work with my dh. If I tell <br/>
him what I&#39;m planning to do, or doing, or ask him to read something, <br/>
he resists (I&#39;m talking about philosophies here, not going to the <br/>
park). He does, however, notice what works. It takes much longer than <br/>
I would like, but he&#39;s been moving in the right direction. Also, when <br/>
I have &quot;solid evidence&quot; that something is working, I make a big deal <br/>
of it--in a very joyful &quot;isn&#39;t it great&quot; way, not &quot;I told you so.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Easiest example is that Mikey has a tendency to give up quickly if <br/>
trying something new, especially if it&#39;s physical. I rarely pushed <br/>
him to take his own clothes off or put them on, but it was hard to <br/>
stay quiet when we really thought he could do it and he&#39;d make a big <br/>
deal about how hard it was. Now, at 3.5, when we come home from <br/>
somewhere he takes his shoes off, puts them away in the hall closet <br/>
and closes the door. I told dh that if Mikey does that at 3.5 without <br/>
us pushing or teaching or anything other than doing it for him, I <br/>
can&#39;t bring myself to worry when he claims he &quot;can&#39;t&quot; do something. <br/>
That was a turning point for my dh.<br/>
<br/>
I reserve the right to vent when he doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; on any given day!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I never actually introduced myself. I&#39;m AJ, tired mom (didn&#39;t <br/>
realize how late it had gotten...my dd woke up twice while I&#39;ve been <br/>
writing) to Mikey who&#39;s 3.5 and talks like he&#39;s about...85, I think <br/>
and Caroline (aka Coo-Coo), almost 18 months. She&#39;s a very determined <br/>
girl who can do anything she sets her mind to and who frightens me on <br/>
an hourly basis. Right now she&#39;s really into dogs so I&#39;ve been <br/>
turning on dog shows on TV a lot, playing with a neighbor&#39;s dogs and <br/>
trying to figure out what else to do! Suggestions welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Mikey is a huuuuge Thomas fan. He doesn&#39;t know it yet, but we&#39;ll be <br/>
riding on the big Thomas in Strasburg, PA in a couple weeks. <br/>
<br/>
I gotta get some sleep! Happy to be here with you all!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It depends what your goals are.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is the family present at the dinner table then the way you go<br/>
about it will be different than if your goal is the family happy at the<br/>
dinner table.<br/>
<br/>
If having them present is the goal, then some acceptable tools to achieve<br/>
that are to make presence a requirement and to make sure they&#39;re very hungry<br/>
when dinner is ready.<br/>
<br/>
If having them happy is the goal, then those techniques won&#39;t work as well.<br/>
If presence is a requirement then one option available to them is merely<br/>
fulfilling the requirement by occupying a seat at the table until excused<br/>
while they think of all the things they&#39;d rather be doing. If hunger is a<br/>
requirement then the atmosphere of dinner is about eating and not about<br/>
being together.<br/>
<br/>
Being at the table needs to be a choice for people to be happy being there.<br/>
And if you want them to choose coming to the table over some other activity,<br/>
dinner time needs to be a time that people look forward to gathering<br/>
together. You can feed them when they&#39;re hungry and ask if they&#39;d like to<br/>
draw or play GameBoy or something else while they visit with the rest of the<br/>
family at dinner time. Or dinner can be like show and tell where everyone<br/>
informs dad of what went on that day. Or you can tell them having the family<br/>
together is something that you really appreciate. (As a way of sharing your<br/>
feelings rather than a way of guilting them into doing something you want<br/>
them to do.) Or something that everyone looks forward to doing together.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that no one can create a Norman Rockwell dinner with hunger and<br/>
requirements to be there but that those aren&#39;t the cause of the atmosphere.<br/>
The atmosphere isn&#39;t created by force. The atmosphere is created because of<br/>
some other dynamic that makes people enjoy being together.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most often we don&#39;t all (4 of us) sit down at the table at the same <br/>
time and &#39;have dinner&#39;.  Many times the kids don&#39;t want what I&#39;ve made <br/>
for DH and myself so they eat something else.  Sometimes they DO like <br/>
what I&#39;ve made, but they&#39;re not ready to leave their toy or project <br/>
and/or they&#39;re waiting to come eat until their movie or tv show is <br/>
over.  Stuff like that.  That&#39;s not to say that we never sit down all <br/>
at once.  It does happen too.  I guess it&#39;s not that big of a deal to <br/>
us any more.....our kids aren&#39;t gone all day at school and they&#39;re too <br/>
young (5 and 3) to be gone at friends&#39; houses much so having a sit down <br/>
family dinner isn&#39;t the only time we have to connect with each other.  <br/>
Hope that makes sense.  LOL<br/>

Greenfield Village ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thehenryford.org">http://www.thehenryford.org</a> ) and the kids had <br/>
fun.  My DD didn&#39;t like how big Thomas&#39;s face is though and she didn&#39;t <br/>
want to go near the front of the train.  lol  There were tents with <br/>
Thomas activities (coloring, &quot;tattoos&quot; of Thomas, Percy and James, <br/>
etc.) and Thomas merchandise (most of which you can find at Toys R Us <br/>
for the same or less money).  The kids had fun though....hope yours do <br/>
too!  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What about sit down meals? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The kids and I eat small meals/snacks throughout the day whenever <br/>
we&#39;re hungry, but I ask everyone not to eat after 3:00pm so they&#39;ll <br/>
have room for dinner, which we eat as a family at 5:30-6:00pm. My <br/>
8yo is the only one who has &quot;problems&quot; with eating certain foods. <br/>
But he is willing to try a few bites of everything.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re taking small steps for a couple of reasons: first dh and I <br/>
feel like we need time to adjust to the new method of doing things, <br/>
and second because our 5yo still needs to be watched over for safety <br/>
reasons (he tends to climb on furniture to get to the high cabinets, <br/>
etc) We&#39;ve told him that we&#39;ll teach him how to do things for <br/>
himself, but he still needs adult supervision/help until we are <br/>
confident that he&#39;s not going to hurt himself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513160747">Hi AJ, and thank you for the special hello too.  I have yet to meet <br/>
any unschooling Air Force families - perhaps someday!  <br/>
<br/>
My dh is gone for a week too, so my girls and I had little pizzas <br/>
and smoothies for dinner.  Really though, sit down dinners are not <br/>
important to him.  He just likes to know what to expect.  He usually <br/>
calls me in the afternoon and asks what&#39;s going on for dinner.  <br/>
Probably the majority of days I do cook something, but at least a <br/>
couple days a week I just don&#39;t feel like it or we have a lot of <br/>
leftovers filling up the fridge or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
In our house, we have the dining table in the same room as the TV, <br/>
so many times we will watch The Simpsons or something that everyone <br/>
likes while we eat.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-533882635">Hi!  I am so thrilled to have found this list (Thanks, Mike!!!).  I&#39;ve recently gotten out of my own way enough to see the real value in working for consensus with my kids, and have been wanting to learn more from families who have more experience.  My husband, Carson, and I are parents to Isaiah (5 next month) and Simon (19mo).  I&#39;ve known since before I had kids that I wanted to unschool with them, and Carson has come to home/unschooling gradually over the years.  Lately the comments I keep getting from strangers are of the &quot;Homeschooling - that must be so much work!&quot; variety, and I am never quite sure how to answer that.  The more I let go of control, the less work there seems to be!<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering how others deal with a 5yo child who is often physically aggressive and will not stop when told that the other people do not like it, are being hurt, are at risk of being hurt, etc.  Frequently I find myself forcing him to stop (holding him, removing him from the situation, etc.), which I think doesn&#39;t really help the long term situation.  I think that two main things are at work here - he is very physical and probably doesn&#39;t get enough puppy-type play, and his personality combined with the years of previous coercion have him still living with a &quot;I have to do it my way and only my way&quot; attitude which keeps him from hearing what we&#39;re saying when we let him know he&#39;s hurting us.  I have been trying to help him find more friends who enjoy wrestling-type play in the hopes that having that outlet will help him be more physically gentle at other times.  I would love any other suggestions.  Anyone been through this and have a perspective to share?<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to learning with you all,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-879354319">Hi Rachel...I&#39;m Wendy, mommy to Lucas (5) and Ethan (2)and we live in <br/>
Souther CA.  What is it with 5 yo boys???? If you go back a bit in <br/>
the archives (you can read them of the web page)...we&#39;ve had a little <br/>
bit of a discussion on limits and 5yo boys in general (look for posts <br/>
on &quot;limits&quot;...my post... and &quot;what to do with 5yo&quot;...Sarah&#39;s post, I <br/>
think).  I too struggle with my 5yo not being quite aware of his <br/>
actions.  I do understand that he is only 5 and he is still learning <br/>
these things.  He is very spirited and tends to be on the impulsive <br/>
side...but yes, my family and I get a little frustrated with getting <br/>
bopped and banged pretty frequently!  It has gotten better...but it&#39;s <br/>
a process.  <br/>

Hi Rachel!<br/>
<br/>
My kids, esp. the 3.5 y o boy, need physical play to maintain sanity <br/>
(theirs and mine). For us, it doesn&#39;t have to be wrestling, tho&#39; we <br/>
do plenty of that, but running, walking, jumping (a trampoline or <br/>
mini-tramp. would be great), etc. This winter, while sick, I <br/>
developed several games that involved me sitting on the couch not <br/>
moving: Hallway Opposites, where Mikey would run down the hall and <br/>
back first slow, then fast, standing up tall, then down low, loud <br/>
then soft...hide and seek where he runs and hides and I send my 1.5 y <br/>
o to find him! Oh, we made obstacle courses with toys and balance <br/>
beams with books on the floor. Dragged all the pillows in the house <br/>
to the living room and built forts, had pillow fights, hid.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on, but the point is that I find something even if we <br/>
don&#39;t leave the living room!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452181458">My daughter is also 9 1/2. She&#39;s a good reader. How did she learn to read? Not like her brother, of course -- that would have been too easy. :) <br/>
<br/>
First, she lives in a house with lots of books. And magazines. Etc. Bought and ordered specifically for her. She has chosen mostly nature/animal themed mags so far. <br/>
<br/>
And she got a library card. Long before she could actually read. I wonder if the way we go to the library is how other people do it. We walk in and I go to my section (murder mysteries :) ) and DD browses in the kids&#39; section until she finds what she wants. Yesterday it was a DVD. Last time it was a book and a DVD. The time before just a book. She is reading the Animal Ark series and enjoying it a lot. <br/>
<br/>
My job at the library is to have the library card ready when she is ready to check out. To notice what she selected and admire it and then get in the car and drive us home.<br/>
<br/>
Now, at one point (she was 6) she specifically said &quot;everyone but me knows how to read&quot; and demanded to be taught using some sort of organized plan. Together we chose the 100 Easy Lessons book and she did about the middle third of it and that solidified her reading enough that she then went to picking out her own books, etc. <br/>
<br/>
She learned to spell south yesterday. We just switched to bellsouth. :) Spelling things correctly is helpful when you are trying to do anything -- like Google a question or find a book in the library or solve a puzzle -- last week one of her mags had a puzzle that involved alphabetizing some animals to solve it -- the punchline was so corny it was a real groaner -- but she amazed me that she even knew HOW to alphabetize a long list of things :). But, really, when you thnk about it, the idea is pretty obvious -- she just hadn&#39;t had it put in front of her as a &quot;worksheet&quot; -- it was something she wanted to play with.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my long ramble is just to say -- it&#39;s OK. Relax. Maybe my DS won&#39;t win any spelling bees. But she reads a lot. Maybe she&#39;s not reading what all the other 9 year old girls are reading in our county. But that&#39;s OK. It&#39;s not a race. It&#39;s not a competition. <br/>
<br/>
I could have worried a lot about her not reading early -- that was the example I had in her brother. But I had started to try to relax about all this stuff by then and she got it when she was ready. And continues to grab a book as a way to relax.<br/>
<br/>
We may have to dash down to babysit her 2-year-old cousin when my SIL has the new baby. So what did we make sure we had packed in our &quot;maybe we&#39;ll have to stay overnight&quot; bag -- a book for each of us of course! That&#39;s what you do when you have free time -- you read something for fun. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more a lifestyle thing than a &quot;what grade level are you on, are you keeping up&quot; thing. <br/>
<br/>
Now, take her brother -- the early reader. You won&#39;t catch him with a book, no sir! Not fiction anyway. He just doesn&#39;t get into it. Now, give him a good logic puzzle book and he&#39;ll be happy. Should I get upset that he isn&#39;t immersed in whatever 11 yo boy popular fiction is these days? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so. Not when you see them. I shouldn&#39;t be upset that they aren&#39;t &quot;on grade level&quot; in any way. Yesterday included an outing to help DS&#39;s Tae Kwon Do teacher lay some tile in his new school. (DH is a tile/marble guy.) In the background, my two kids were running and box balling and having fun with the other kids and what more can I really want? They are just clearly so happy! <br/>
<br/>
Then the lady who is a black belt and an artist came up and we talked and she asked about the hsing, how it works, etc. &quot;No, we don&#39;t test, don&#39;t use a curric, what we do is called unschooling. We learn as things come up and as we become interested. Etc.&quot; (You&#39;ll develop you&#39;re own spiel as you unschool. :) ) The lady explained that if she ever has children she wouldn&#39;t want to send them to school. She was bullied in school (artistic type even then :) ) and thinks it sounds great to hs but thought it was much more regulated, etc. She was happily surprised. But she knows my son. She&#39;s seen him and talked with him for years. And she knows he&#39;s a great kid. She really got how this relaxed sort of lifestyle is working for him! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is all just to say my family may not be anything like yours. But that&#39;s OK. Even within our family there are big differences in interests and rates of learning and what age people do what -- and it&#39;s all OK. We don&#39;t measure ourselves by what the Florida Sunshine State Standards say the kids should be doing (although I did at one time!). We don&#39;t compare our kids to yours or the neighbor&#39;s. We try to avoid comparing them even to each other -- even when they do, we point out that it&#39;s not a real thing -- to compare one person&#39;s interest/ability in one area to another person&#39;s passion. It doesn&#39;t make sense. To say she draws better and he&#39;s quick on a math joke -- it just doesn&#39;t bear comparison. So why would a comparison to some list put out in our state&#39;s capitol make any sense? :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gone on too long but I know this is all difficult and it is hard to relax and just know that something like reading can&#39;t be forced. When you just know it is such an important tool in the world. But it will come. It will. When it is needed. And if your DD can ask you for help when she needs to, so much the better. Rather than shutting down because she feels a particular book or whatever is being forced on her -- if it&#39;s her own curiosity about something that leads her to need to be able to read about it -- what a lovely thing to discover and own! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been interrupted a bunch of times here and it probably shows in my long ramble -- but you get the idea. :)<br/>

<br/>
============================================================<br/>
My biggest concern with a less <br/>
structured approach to <br/>
homeschooling is that she&#39;ll never learn to read or spell.  There are <br/>
so many ways to avoid <br/>
those things -- books on tape, TV/videos, etc. that she could be very <br/>
functional for a long <br/>
time without &quot;needing&quot; to read. <br/>
<br/>
Any feedback would be appreciated.  If this topic of &quot;how to be sure <br/>
your child will learn <br/>
what s/he needs to learn&quot; has been discussed recently, just point me to <br/>
the archives.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622997865">Hello,<br/>
     I have been homeschooling my 8 year old girl (2nd grade ish) for 3 <br/>
years<br/>
now.   We are unschooling little by little as I learn about it and try to<br/>
incorporate it into our days.  Our homeschooling up to this point has been <br/>
mostly reading to her and reading to her and reading to her, and following <br/>
her interests as far as she wants to take them.  I have learned (the hard <br/>
way) that she will learn what she wants, when she wants, and as deep as she <br/>
wants and I just need to help her when she wants help and not &quot;teach&quot; her. <br/>
My 3 year old son is following the same pattern of being his own person and <br/>
not so much doing what I say, but taking what I say as advice and doing what <br/>
he thinks is right.  I was just like this as a child (still am) so of course <br/>
my mom is just laughing and laughing at my trials.  I think that the kids <br/>
insistence on being treated with respect and not talked down to or ordered <br/>
about is pretty neat and it&#39;s teaching me to be a better person and to treat <br/>
my kids like the real people that they are.<br/>
      My question has to do with Natalie cleaning her room.  I used to ask <br/>
her to do chores in the morning.  She had one chore a day, and on Mondays <br/>
and Fridays her chore was to straighten out her room. I have since stopped <br/>
trying to schedule her to do chores, and just ask her to help out when I <br/>
need some help.  I told her that she was in charge of her room and that I <br/>
would not be asking her to clean it 2 days a week anymore.  If she wanted it <br/>
clean, she could clean it and if she didn&#39;t want it clean she did not have <br/>
to clean it.  That was about a month ago.  Her room is now<br/>
shin deep in clothes, toys, scraps of paper, tape, etc...I have no problem <br/>
with this.  She has been having fun creating stuff and playing in there. The <br/>
problem is that now she doesn&#39;t like playing in there anymore because there <br/>
is so much stuff on the floor she can&#39;t move.  She came up to me and asked <br/>
me to help her clean her room.  In the past this has not worked for us.  It <br/>
starts with her helping (picking up the clothes while I pick up the books) <br/>
and devolves into her playing while I do all the work.  I end up getting <br/>
angry about the huge mess, her lack of help and just sending her out of the <br/>
room so I can finish it quicker.  How can I change this to better reflect an <br/>
unschooling attitude?  I don&#39;t want to shield her from the consequences of <br/>
her actions, but I also hate to see her faced with this mountainous task.  I <br/>
was thinking that maybe I could help her clean as long as she was cleaning <br/>
also (and not playing).  That means I end up watching her while I&#39;m cleaning <br/>
and judging her cleaning to see if it&#39;s up to my standards or if I need to <br/>
stop helping because she is no longer cleaning like I think she should be <br/>
cleaning.  Yuck.  So far I have been too busy to do anything about her room. <br/>
Natalie has asked me several times when we can clean it and I have told her <br/>
I&#39;m not sure.  When she comes up to me asking for something to do because <br/>
she is bored I tell her she can pick up the clothes in her room.  This <br/>
usually sets off a pouting spree about how hard it is and how she does not <br/>
want to and I tell not to do it if she does not want to.  Any ideas would be <br/>
greatly appreciated.<br/>
Thank you<br/>

Now Julie, don&#39;t you really mean it has not worked for *you*? ;)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  This usually sets off a pouting spree about how hard it is and how she<br/>
does not want to and I tell not to do it if she does not want to.  Any ideas<br/>
would be greatly appreciated.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OK, here are my thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
Firstly if it such a horrible big job for you, no wonder it is overwhelming<br/>
for her. I think you are kinda abandoning her to a task that is too big for<br/>
her - maybe always was too big. She needs help. Try to let go of your &quot;teach<br/>
her responsibility&quot; agenda.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I do with Jayn&#39;s small playroom - which can get absolutely full<br/>
and unusable very quickly. I ask her if she is done with the game (usually<br/>
Barbie&#39;s), so that I can put it away. Then I put it away in the very<br/>
organized system of canvas boxes that I have created to facilitate the clean<br/>
ups and storage. <br/>
<br/>
I do the same with the games that Jayn spreads out in the living room, and<br/>
in the bedroom. I do the same when her art table becomes overrun with<br/>
partially completed projects and tools. I put away the clothes that she<br/>
tends to dump on the floor in her quest to get at her clothes in her drawers<br/>
immediately after. (This latter I sometime grumble a bit about - although I<br/>
do the same for my dh&#39;s clothes and laundry - and part of the problem is<br/>
poor drawer organization. She wouldn&#39;t need to drop stuff if she could see<br/>
her stuff more easily)<br/>
<br/>
These swift clean ups are my gift to Jayn - the gift of a clean slate. I do<br/>
them often so that they are not too time consuming for me. <br/>
<br/>
For some reason, of being busy with other stuff, her room had been left for<br/>
a long time last week, and the same phenomenon of not playing in there had<br/>
occurred. I just bit the bullet and took the extra time to tidy it and she<br/>
was really grateful. I also took the opportunity to move Jayn&#39;s art table<br/>
out of her room and back to the living room - the reverse placement was an<br/>
experiment that failed to make her life easier. The result has been non-stop<br/>
art creation for the two days that it has been back accessible.<br/>
<br/>
Recently she has started spontaneously putting some things away by herself.<br/>
She has also started helping me with the clean ups, especially when things<br/>
have gotten out of hand in the living room. Other times she continues to<br/>
play while I tidy up - we are still spending time together both being happy.<br/>
<br/>
I have posted before about the lovely moments when Jayn has given us the<br/>
sweet gift of a surprise bed make or grocery bag empty or jumped up to take<br/>
my plate to the kitchen. Yesterday she got out a fresh toilet roll on her<br/>
own recognizance. <br/>
<br/>
There was a problem with bits of small plastic that hold the straws onto<br/>
juice boxes. I was forever finding them on the floor all over the house. I<br/>
told Jayn that it was hard for me to be bending and asked for her<br/>
suggestions. She said that she would bring them to me, and now she does -<br/>
almost always. One less little bit of mess to worry about. <br/>
<br/>
The other thing is that if I truly don&#39;t want to do a big clean up, I give<br/>
myself permission not to at that time, and do it when I feel energetic.<br/>
<br/>
My advice therefore is to cheerfully clean up her room before it gets out of<br/>
hand. Enjoy her being in there keeping you company. If it continues to bug<br/>
you that you are working while she plays, then do it while she is busy<br/>
elsewhere. (I wonder if there is a parallel here to how our dh&#39;s may<br/>
sometimes feel off working while we play). <br/>
<br/>
Know that she will eventually spontaneously enjoy helping you with household<br/>
stuff and even start giving you gifts of unlooked for help. Take the<br/>
opportunity to examine the land use aspect of her room and storage systems<br/>
to update it for ease of use and clean up.<br/>

<br/>
Stop getting angry. It&#39;s all about attitude. I will help  Casey clean her room when she asks. Quite often I&#39;ll end up doing a larger share of the task. That&#39;s okay. We&#39;re spending time together and I don&#39;t mind the physical act of putting things away and sorting and tidying. We&#39;re also talking and laughing and discovering bits and pieces of new connections. I actually like when she finds something wonderful in her room to play with again.<br/>
<br/>
Some days, if her room is really bothering me, I&#39;ll go in and clean it all by myself while listening to music or a book on tape. Casey is always delighted and truly appreciative of my help. She repays me with other kindnesses more suited to her own temperament and personality.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Natalie has asked me several times when we can clean it and I have told her I&#39;m not sure.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Next time she asks, try setting a timer for 15 or 30 minutes and clean for only that long. Quit when the timer  goes off, done or  not. Just like in unschooling, everything counts in cleaning. Keep at it in little spurts like this and the job will get done eventually.<br/>
<br/>

I always HATED hearing stuff like this from my mom. Here I was I was asking for inspiration and she was giving me Puritan work ethic.&lt;g&gt;  I&#39;ve been known to spout the same suggestion at my kids from time to time. It&#39;s not a great one. I have to consciously remind myself to remember what&#39;s important in *their* world and work from that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778614033">Our living room/dining room is also our play area and the space where  <br/>
toys are stored, in a very handy set of dishpans on shelves. But  <br/>
sometimes if the kids have been busy and there are toys, pieces of  <br/>
paper, all kind of stuff strewn everywhere it feels overwhelming to  <br/>
me to try to pick it all up and sort it into its proper bins. What I  <br/>
do then is get an empty laundry basket, and start at one end, working  <br/>
my way to the other end and just tossing everything into the laundry  <br/>
basket. That gets the floor picked up and helps me feel a bit more  <br/>
&quot;whelmed.&quot; Later, I set a timer for five minutes and work on sorting  <br/>
the contents of the laundry basket into their appropriate dishpans. I  <br/>
do little five-minute spurts off and on until it&#39;s put away.<br/>
<br/>
My 4 yo finds it too much to try to pick up and sort things into  <br/>
various bins. The laundry basket approach works well for him, too,  <br/>
because it&#39;s simple: if something is on the floor, it goes in the  <br/>
basket. The baby can help, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481664803">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I hear you want to help her, so how do you go about helping her clean her room without getting angry?<br/>
<br/>
I suggest you give her the gift of a clean room. Maybe even do it when she is at a friends house. All the way to having flowers on her desk, just because you love her.<br/>
<br/>
Or while she plays happily with whatever you turn up from the depths of her mess, talk to her about where she wants to put things, get her opinion on what you are throwing away. You can be engaged with her while doing all the physical stuff. The mental stuff is hard work too, figuring out where to hang the pictures, or if she wants to save her friends broken bracelet.<br/>
<br/>
Once I stopped mentally insisting my dd help clean her room, I found joy in the process. I try to always help her when she asks me, if it is reasonable. And if I am too busy with something, I tell her when  I will be available.<br/>
<br/>
My dd keeps a messy room and about 1 time a month I go and clean it up while she is away and she so loves it, to come home to clean sheets and a made bed with the pillows just perfect and the floor vacuumed. Once clean it stays cleans until a gaggle of girls turn it into a fashion design studio. She has cleaned it her self, but she enjoys my company and I am happy to be there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906623998">My 11 yo dd has a messy room(not mounds of stuff, but messy) and bath, <br/>
but she doesn&#39;t want me to clean it anymore.  I often cleaned her room <br/>

months ago that she will take care of it.<br/>
<br/>
This coincided with her starting her period, so, I&#39;m wondering if it <br/>
is a private issue now.  On laundry day she brings me the laundry and <br/>
on trash day she insist on emptying her own trash.  I was willing to <br/>
continue, are their any other tween moms that this happen to?<br/>

&gt; A number of people posted about the healthy snacks their kids choose <br/>
&gt; throughout the day. What about sit down meals? It&#39;s vital to me to <br/>
&gt; eat breakfast and it sure helps my ds&#39; (3.5) mood if he eats fairly <br/>
&gt; soon after waking up. Small meals and snacks throughout the day are <br/>
&gt; fine with me, but I sure like the idea of a sit down dinner for the <br/>
&gt; family. So I&#39;m curious what unschooling families do--skip big sit <br/>
&gt; down big meals, have them completely optional, etc. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dinner is prepared as a sit down meal (pasta and sauce, stir fry, <br/>
chicken and veggies, the typical type stuff). DH and I sit down to the <br/>
table to eat - I&#39;m just getting home from work at that time so we use <br/>
the time to connect and sort out the evening&#39;s activities and whatnot. <br/>
DS can choose to sit at the table, take his plate to the living room <br/>
and finish watching whatever he&#39;s into at the time, finish doing <br/>
something and come in to the table, even choose to skip it and eat <br/>
later on (although that&#39;s a rarity since he&#39;s a 7 1/2 yr old all <br/>
energy, all the time, growing, hungry boy - one time he was hitting a <br/>
growing spot and was eating 3 egg omelettes as &#39;snacks&#39; along with a <br/>
regular breakfast, lunch, dinner and other in-betweens).<br/>
<br/>
I too just have to eat upon rising (I get up, shower, then eat after <br/>
that the rest of the day can start). DH and DS however tend to prefer <br/>
to wait a short while (anywhere from 15 minutes to an hourish) before <br/>
eating. Don&#39;t know exactly why but that&#39;s what works best for them. <br/>
<br/>
I think if the evening meal is made inviting and non-mandatory you&#39;re <br/>
more likely to have a pleasant meal (which I think is what most folks <br/>
want - rarely do they want a &#39;sit down because I said so I don&#39;t care <br/>
how you feel&#39; time). Sometimes DS will take his plate to the living <br/>
room then bring it back again after whatever is over (unless he just <br/>
postpones starting which is also okay) to sit with us. And, sometimes, <br/>
when he brings his plate back (yup he brings his plate, utensils, etc <br/>
back to the kitchen without being asked), if we&#39;re still sitting <br/>
there, he&#39;ll sit with us and chat.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s helpful to realize that kids can create far bigger messes than  <br/>
they can master ;-)<br/>
<br/>
They often seem as competent as adults but they&#39;re still just kids.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, after working on National Novel Writing Month with my  <br/>
daughter where everything but the basic necessities (food and clean  <br/>
dishes) were attended to, the house is still pretty much trashed.  <br/>
Looking at it is overwhelming. I don&#39;t know where to begin. I know  <br/>
that even if I give it an hour it&#39;s still going to look trashed.  <br/>
(From past experience I know a 3 day blitz will get it back into  <br/>
shape -- which I&#39;ll have to do since my in-laws are coming for  <br/>
Christmas ;-) -- but it&#39;s a huge commitment of time and energy -- and  <br/>
putting aside of more fun things!)<br/>
<br/>
*That&#39;s* how a messy room can look to a child. In fact that&#39;s how a  <br/>
pile of toys in the living room can look to a younger child. It&#39;s  <br/>
huge and overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
When parents can&#39;t understand why a child isn&#39;t doing something on  <br/>
their own, multiply it by tenfold and see how it looks to you. :-)<br/>

Some  days, if her room is really bothering me, I&#39;ll go in and clean it all <br/>
by  myself while listening to music or a book on tape. Casey is always <br/>
delighted  and truly appreciative of my help. She repays me with other kindnesses more <br/>
 suited to her own temperament and personality.<br/>

This is my kids, as I have noticed. Don&#39;t like picking up their clothes and  <br/>
toys, but, they think the Dust Buster and dusting mitts are toys. LOL... As <br/>
I&#39;m  beginning to see their likes and dislikes more, I will gladly let them use <br/>
those  to their hearts&#39; content and I will straighten their rooms out. I <br/>
dislike  dusting, so more power to them LOL  <br/>
