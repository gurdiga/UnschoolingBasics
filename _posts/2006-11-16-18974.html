<div id="ygrps-yiv-624216582">We just finished watching our DVD Muzzy spanish video and my 12-YO son <br/>
is enjoying learning spanish but wants something with a storyline for <br/>
older kids.  Anybody know of anything?  I am not sure exactly what he <br/>
is looking for.  I asked him if he wanted to see more girls, dating and <br/>
such, and he laughed and said &quot;not really&quot;.   Someone should come up <br/>
with a DVD movie in Spanish (with English subtitles) that is like Lord <br/>
of the Rings--that&#39;s what my son wants.  I checked at the library for <br/>
Spanish movies that would have English subtitles, but couldn&#39;t find any~<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Beth</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778658644">Beth, maybe you could try Netflix?  In highschool our teacher got a few movies for us to watch in Spanish, including Raiders of the Lost Ark. :o)<br/>

Harry Potter I think does (or the box might mean Spanish subtitles.)<br/>
<br/>
Check the backs of the DVDs. French is a pretty common dub but lots  <br/>
of them include Spanish too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-351735652">Sounds silly, but if you have telemundo on your cable or satellite system, <br/>
the kids can watch SOME shows on there - some are inappropriate and awful. <br/>
My kids have gotten some great things from there.  Plus, even sillier, they <br/>
now understand much of what Ricky says to Lucy on I Love Lucy reruns, and <br/>
LOVE when Judge Milian speaks Spanish on the People&#39;s Court.<br/>

Hey, you get your education in some odd places, no?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Quite a few popular movies have a Spanish track.  You just have to go<br/>
into the set up menu for the dvd and select Spanish.  We watched<br/>
Princess Bride in Spanish the other day.  It&#39;s fun to do when you<br/>
already know the track well enough to follow the story.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle - whose favorite Spanish language film is Like Water for<br/>
Chocolate, but I think it may not be what a tween would want to watch<br/>
LOL!</div>

 </span></blockquote>My kids have been watching Pink Panther. Not the Peter<br/>
Sellers movies, but the animated short films. They<br/>
have no dialogs. But they have a lot of signs. Lately,<br/>
they&#39;ve started pausing when s sign comes up. My 7 yo<br/>
tries to read it and asks me what it is if she can&#39;t.<br/>
My 5 yo simply asks. The interesting thing is they<br/>
remember what it says when they&#39;re watching it another<br/>
day. I wonder if people will believe me if I tell them<br/>
that my kids learned to read from watching Pink<br/>
Panther!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198843926">Our television has a language option.  I think the DVD player itself <br/>
does as well.  We do that sometimes just for fun.<br/>
