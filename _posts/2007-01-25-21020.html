<div id="ygrps-yiv-192151181">For those of you that don&#39;t know our family&#39;s background here&#39;s a <br/>
quick run down.  We have seven children and three grandchildren.  We <br/>
graduated four out of our local high school.  Our youngest, almost <br/>
13, has been home most of the time.  The next two oldest, 15 and <br/>
almost 17, just came home within the last year.  <br/>
<br/>
The 17 year old is our youngest daughter.  She was in the  local <br/>
charter school when we were finally able to bring her home.  It was <br/>
just a year in December.  During that time a lot happened.  We had <br/>
three grandchildren.  I helped with two of them full-time.  I just <br/>
stopped in January.  <br/>
<br/>
During this year we have done some interesting things, but time was <br/>
limited due to caring for new babies.  The kids have done a lot of <br/>
deschooling.  I was excited about this month and being able to <br/>
dedicate my time 100 percent to my children.  I spent the first two <br/>
weeks sick.  So, we&#39;re just getting on with our life this week.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the wee hours of the morning and I am typing this email because <br/>
I got up for the early morning &quot;potty run&quot; and discovered a letter <br/>
taped to my door knob from our 17 year old daughter.  She wants to go <br/>
back to school.<br/>
<br/>
In the letter she is stating social reasons of why she wanted to come <br/>
home to begin with.  There are many reasons I know of why she should <br/>
not return to school.  Unschooling is about freedom, and I don&#39;t want <br/>
to force her to do anything.  BUT, I would like her to continue in <br/>
freedom and am going to need to be on my toes.  My husband is still <br/>
warming to the kids&#39; new lifestyle.  We are just starting to get into <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
When she was in PS she should have been going into 11th grade.  She <br/>
would have failed and stayed in 10th.  Really it was 9th/10th.  If <br/>
she were to go back to school she would only be in 9th grade at <br/>
almost 18.  It&#39;s just not practical.  In her letter she states that <br/>
she doesn&#39;t feel that she can learn what she needs to know at home.  <br/>
She certainly won&#39;t learn it at PS.<br/>
<br/>
I tried reading the Teenage Liberation Handbook with her.  She wasn&#39;t <br/>
into it.  Honestly, her friends all go to PS.  She has NO HS <br/>
friends.  In my mind this was the year of opportunity for her.  I&#39;ve <br/>
offered community ed classes in things she&#39;s interested in.  She <br/>
turned it down.  She really has not set or achieved any goals since <br/>
she&#39;s been home.  I&#39;ve not seen a dedication to anything.  No <br/>
passion.  It&#39;s been concerning to me, but I was looking to provide a <br/>
lot of opportunity this year.  By this I don&#39;t mean educational <br/>
looking things.  I mean real life opportunities.  <br/>
<br/>
In my mind we were just getting ready to get on with life.  Any <br/>
suggestions as to the direction to go here.  What would you do if it <br/>
were your child?  I know going back to traditional PS is not really a <br/>
viable option.  There are so many more options available to her.  She <br/>
could go to college if she wanted.  <br/>
<br/>
ALL input welcome and desired.  I need a strong back bone here <br/>
supported with wisdom.  You are all the best back support there is.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She wants to go back right now or at the start of the next school <br/>
year? If its *right now* I&#39;d call the school and find out how that <br/>
would work - would they have to test her to find out what classes <br/>
she could be in? How long would that take? Is she going to have <br/>
to &quot;catch up&quot; in those classes? I&#39;d also find out what the school <br/>
policy is wrt homework. More and more schools are starting to impose <br/>
penalties beyond lowered grades for missed homework, so I&#39;d want to <br/>
look into that. Its not a decision that should be made either way <br/>
without some research.<br/>
<br/>
What happens - this is another thing to look into - when she does <br/>
turn 18? You said she&#39;s almost 17, so there&#39;s one more year of <br/>
compulsory education. What then? Does she just want to &quot;do her time&quot; <br/>
and then stop? What&#39;s the school&#39;s policy on this? Can she start a <br/>
new school year if she&#39;s Already 18, 18.5, 19? Or does she have to <br/>
switch to a different school at that point?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does she know this? is she okay with it? What would that look like, <br/>
really? She&#39;ll be in mixed age classes for electives, anyway. Do <br/>
they have specific &quot;remedial&quot; classes? If so, those are probably <br/>
mixed-age or mostly older kids. More questions to ask the school.<br/>
<br/>
Not practical in what way? I can see having one kid in school and <br/>
the rest not as being disruptive - we dealt with that for almost a <br/>
month when my stepson first moved in with us. Dealing with clothes <br/>
and homework and getting to and from school etc was a big hassle for <br/>
us and definately impacted our whole family. That being said, this <br/>
girl may not be feeling all warm-fuzzy about y&#39;alls family right <br/>
now, if she feels her needs have been taking a backseat. Obviously <br/>
she doesn&#39;t feel as though she can communicate with you directly, so <br/>
I wonder what else she&#39;s feeling constrained about. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In my mind this was the year of opportunity for her.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds as though in *her* mind she&#39;s had a year of being stuck <br/>
with no-one to hang out with in a family focussed on the needs of <br/>
infants, not teens. She&#39;s not in a position to trust that &quot;this <br/>
year&quot; will be any better than the last. Show her you&#39;re taking her <br/>
seriously by finding out what she needs to know about going back to <br/>
school. Not in a &quot;look how hard this will be&quot; sort of way!!! If she <br/>
feels like she&#39;s been sidelined so you can deal with two babies, <br/>
she&#39;s only going to feel *less* valued if you turn around and <br/>
say &quot;No, that&#39;s too much trouble&quot; when she wants something. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535130059">If I were you I would immediately look into some community college classes  <br/>
for her. She could select a class of interest to her without the overwhelming  <br/>
social pressure of high school.  I graduated from a community college with  an <br/>
associates degree at age 18 so she is definitely not too young. <br/>

she afraid that you&#39;ll be sucked into the grandmothering thing again? I<br/>
mean, you might have told her that you&#39;ll have time now, but does she<br/>
trust you on that one?<br/>
<br/>
What *exactly* does she think she&#39;ll get out of school? Would doing<br/>
school-at-home make her happier than unschooling? Why does she not want<br/>
to take some classes at a community college? Is she afraid they&#39;ll be<br/>
too difficult, or that she&#39;ll be too young, or...? You could ask her<br/>
whether she wants to try the GED. If she flunks it, it doesn&#39;t matter,<br/>
and you&#39;d know what her weak points are as far as getting into college<br/>
are concerned, and if she doesn&#39;t flunk it, it might give her more<br/>
confidence and encourage her to try some college courses. They offer<br/>
the GED more or less year round, iirc... I took it almost two years ago<br/>
in March. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180805617">Meredith,<br/>
I was going to say the exact same thing about the family focus. What I was going to <br/>
suggest however, was apologizing for the past year, and asking her if &quot;we&quot; the family <br/>
could work on making sure HER needs were met. If you can show her you mean it for six <br/>
months, then maybe she&#39;d have some more trust going into this. Let her know that you <br/>
understand how serious she is, and that things ARE going to change.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go, speaking of needs being met<br/>
