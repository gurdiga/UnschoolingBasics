 </span></blockquote>If you can find it, look for &quot;More Bugs in Boxes&quot; or maybe it is &quot;Bugs in<br/>
Boxes.&quot;  It&#39;s sort of hard to find and we ended up ordering it from some<br/>
obscure place online.  It is a FUN and funny program that most toddlers can<br/>
do easily.  there is matching and song making and other games that are just<br/>
really fun to do.  This was Mary Elayne and Keon&#39;s favorite game to play for<br/>
the longest time.  Emily even enjoyed it when we first got it.  When it died<br/>
and we had hunt for the second one, Dan made a copy of it and we kept the<br/>
original safe up on a shelf.  It&#39;s a fun and not nearly as annoying game as<br/>
some other games meant for toddlers.  And the bugs are all cute and funny,<br/>
not realistic.  The weird thing is that the kids haven&#39;t played it in a long<br/>
time but I can still remember some of the songs.  :)<br/>

**We were just singing one today - How many, how many, how many bugs in a<br/>
box? &lt;G&gt;  We like the first one (Bugs in a Box) better than the second (More<br/>
Bugs in a Box).  ~Rue<br/>
