<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053992658">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping that some of you out there might be able to help me<br/>
complile some quotes or links to articles to share with my in-laws<br/>
about what my hopes are in educating my son the unschooly way. It<br/>
would be helpful to me to better know what I am doing as well. :)<br/>
<br/>
I live about 500 ft. from their door and my son wishes he could go<br/>
there all hours of the day. I don&#39;t expect them to be able to<br/>
accomplish a radical unschooling environment, but I do want to at<br/>
least share with them some of my wishes.<br/>
<br/>
My mother-in-law has decided that my son needs discipline, so she has<br/>
been making up all of these rules, like, &quot;in grandma&#39;s house we...&quot;<br/>
and she teaches him things that include quizing kinds of questions. It<br/>
makes me uncomfortable, but she is so sick of me being particular<br/>
about everything she does with him that I want to present the<br/>
information instead of saying, &quot;Don&#39;t do this. Don&#39;t do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

her own relationship with your son. If she has different rules, so  <br/>
what? There are different rules in stores than homes and we manage to  <br/>
accept that. If she imposes so many rules and spends so much time  <br/>
quizzing him that he doesn&#39;t want to go, then that&#39;s his choice --  <br/>
and her choice.<br/>
<br/>
*If* he starts balking at going you might want to point out that  <br/>
every moment she spends with him she&#39;s creating memories and right  <br/>
now she&#39;s creating memories of a person that her grandson doesn&#39;t  <br/>
want to spend time with.<br/>
<br/>
You can still offer information about unschooling but I wouldn&#39;t do  <br/>
it with the purpose of changing her. Do it because you think she  <br/>
might be interested.<br/>

I totally agree.<br/>
If a family member is actually toxic and not safe with a child, then<br/>
contact should be very limited and parents need to be present. BUT, if<br/>
you&#39;re talking about rules and limitations that vary from home to<br/>
home, that&#39;s real life. Kids are smart. They learn that their<br/>
relatinship with Grandma is different from their relationship with Mom<br/>
or Dad. That&#39;s ok. <br/>
<br/>
I think telling other people how to respect our radical unschooling<br/>
preferences is disrespectful! Let your child own their relationship<br/>
with the Grandparent and unless it&#39;s truly harmful, give it some<br/>
space. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s doing kids any favors to make them think<br/>
that other households need to honor OUR way of doing things.<br/>
<br/>
Our home is different, they understand that. So far, it hasn&#39;t been a<br/>
big issue to adjust to different homes and spaces and the rules or<br/>
limitations therein.<br/>
