<div id="ygrps-yiv-283484792">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a newbie here and I need help responding to my sister.  She has an <br/>
11yo step-son (living with her and DH), a 6yo dd and a 3mo ds.  She is <br/>
younger than me.  Both of her kids are attending a private Christian <br/>
school.  Her 6yo dd is finishing up K-5.  My sister called me the other <br/>
day on her way to pick up the kids from school and asked me if I&#39;d tutor <br/>
her daughter some this summer in reading and math.  Seems that my niece <br/>
is just testing at &quot;average&quot; and the teacher is recommending that my <br/>
niece do some work over the summer.  My sister has already signed her up <br/>
for 4wks of tutoring at school (sounds kind of like summer school <br/>
because it&#39;s not individual tutoring and I think it&#39;s just an hour or <br/>
two each week).  My mom offered me up to my sister, probably because I <br/>
have told them that I will be homeschooling my 5yo ds (I haven&#39;t <br/>
mentioned unschooling to them, they&#39;re not ready for that).<br/>
<br/>
So, in our less than 5 minute conversation, my sister told me that my <br/>
niece is resisting her bedtime reading assignments (they have to read <br/>
something before they go to bed ~ suggested by the teacher).  I <br/>
suggested that my sister not struggle with her on this.  I suggested <br/>
that my sister, her husband or her older son could read the stories <br/>
while my niece looked on.  She&#39;ll still get the story, she&#39;ll still be <br/>
&quot;learning,&quot; etc.  I also suggested that she not make this an issue with <br/>
my niece, especially at this young age.  I reminded my sister how much <br/>
she hates to read, and we don&#39;t want that to happen with my niece.  I <br/>
told my sister that my niece could come a long way on her own this <br/>
summer, without all the tutoring and workbooks, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I would love for my sister to read John Holt&#39;s &quot;Learning All the Time.&quot;  <br/>
My local library has it on hold for someone, so I don&#39;t know when it <br/>
will be available.  I know my sister hates to read, but at least this <br/>
book is an easy read and may help her understand a little more.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of ironic, my niece begs my sister to homeschool her because <br/>
she hates getting up in the morning to go to school.  She is at the <br/>
prime time to be unschooled.  My niece is extremely verbal, was talking <br/>
in complete sentences by age 1.  I think unschooling would be so freeing <br/>
for her (and her brother too).  My sister&#39;s husband would flip his lid <br/>
over it though.  I know he probably thinks I&#39;m a lunatic for co-sleeping <br/>
and extended nursing, but he is softening up to it some in his older age <br/>
and especially because they have a newborn in the house.<br/>
<br/>
So, what suggestions do you wise women and men have for me?  I really <br/>
don&#39;t want to do &quot;school&quot; with her over the summer.  My son would love <br/>
to have her over just to play.<br/>
<br/>
TIA!<br/>

average be ok?  Why do kids feel the need to be &quot;above average?&quot;  By sending<br/>
a child to summer school and with labelling the child &quot;average&quot; (like it&#39;s a<br/>
bad thing) the message this child is going to get is &quot;I&#39;m not good enough&quot;<br/>
and the child will learn to hate learning.  I would be sympathetic that your<br/>
sister is feeling stressed about this, but I don&#39;t see why you should tutor<br/>
your niece when you wouldn&#39;t &quot;tutor&quot; your own child.  Invite them over for<br/>
playdates with your son or something.  Also, half.com is an excellent<br/>
resource for inexpensive books.  I&#39;m constantly paying more in shipping than<br/>
I am for books LOL!  You may find a few books on there that you could<br/>
purchase for your own library and to share with your sister.  Holt&#39;s How<br/>
Children Learn is also an excellent book!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-630084890">I agree, it&#39;s ridiculous, especially at six, to worry about reading.  <br/>
That is the focus, though, in public schools. From what I&#39;m  <br/>
understanding, the sister who doesn&#39;t like to read has  a daughter  <br/>
who&#39;s resisting reading. I&#39;m visualizing (and correct me if I&#39;m  <br/>
wrong) that the mom only reads when she *has* to, and it&#39;s only the  <br/>
one book they do at bedtime? She probably never sits and reads,  <br/>
setting an example of loving to read, and she doesn&#39;t take her  <br/>
daughter to the library to find fun books that the child would be  <br/>
interested in.<br/>
<br/>
I would say that sure, you&#39;ll tutor, drop the niece off twice a week  <br/>
(or as often as you can). And when she&#39;s there do no teaching. Spend  <br/>
a while relaxing and letting her do what she likes with her cousin.  <br/>
Tell your sister that you&#39;re building trust first. Before she comes,  <br/>
plan stuff with your son of fun stuff they can do....mixing edible  <br/>
playdough, playing dinosaurs, whatever they like. Then you can  <br/>
introduce things slowly, while they&#39;re mixing, say &quot;Wow, we put in  <br/>
one cup of peanut butter, one cup of honey, one cup of oatmeal, and  <br/>
one of powdered milk. I wonder how many cups of playdough we have?&quot;  <br/>
We double our recipe when friends come over, so how many cups of milk  <br/>
should we put in? When they are transitioning in play, ask if they  <br/>
would like a story, or be willing to sit in the corner of the room  <br/>
reading your own book. Set lots of good instances of reading. &quot;WOW!  <br/>
I&#39;m reading this book and it says that snakes usually lay eggs, but  <br/>
some species have LIVE BABIES! Can you believe it?&quot; See if there is a  <br/>
summer reading program, and sign the kids up. Offer to take the kids  <br/>
on that day so you can take her to a great resource.<br/>
<br/>
And hey, she hasn&#39;t specified HOW to tutor, just that she wants you  <br/>
to. I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;re in a rough spot, but I would definitely  <br/>
take the child JUST so you can ensure she gets a break and is in an  <br/>
environment where learning is fun. And just so you know, the new  <br/>
summer programs are a lot more fun than what we saw as summer school.  <br/>
Josh signed up for it just to go two summers in a row (and he is way  <br/>
above grade level in all topics)...and actually is going this year as  <br/>
a peer mentor even though we&#39;re unschooling and not even part of the  <br/>
district. LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-405331222">Seriously! So kids with learning disabilities need extra help to get <br/>
them &quot;up to par&quot; and the gifted kids need extra work to challenge them <br/>
so they won&#39;t be bored. Now the average kids need extra help and work <br/>
too?<br/>

Where does it end?<br/>

Labels, labels, labels. (Shaking my head in disbelief.) Why can&#39;t we <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s just what I would suggest. I&#39;d tell your sister that you&#39;d love to have her daughter over to play. Tell her that you don&#39;t plan on doing any formal curriculum with your son this summer as you believe a natural, life learning approach will best suit his needs right now. I&#39;d send her links to webpages a little at a time and see if she responds positively to any of it. I definitely wouldn&#39;t take on the task of tutoring her child when it&#39;s not something you believe in.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Reading requirements and reading incentive programs had the reverse <br/>
effect on my son.  He learned to read before he ever went to school -<br/>
- and the combined effect of requirements and incentives killed his <br/>
love of reading.  It took YEARS to counter the effects, and even <br/>
still, he reads in spurts, and very specific, narrow interest, in <br/>
general.  (Mind you, he has always been &quot;ahead of grade level&quot; -- <br/>
but the interest has to be there.)<br/>
<br/>
When I read Alfie Kohn&#39;s Punished By Rewards, I suddenly understood <br/>
it a lot more.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, one thing I did sometimes when my son was little, (he&#39;s 14 now, <br/>
and the prebed storytime seems to have evaporated somewhere along <br/>
the line, though I still read aloud sometimes to him, and we have <br/>
fun discussing it), is read to him, until my voice got tired, then <br/>
he would take a turn.  The important part is to get them involved in <br/>
what they are hearing -- if it is uninteresting, why would they want <br/>
to read it?  (Heck, if it is boring, why would I want to read it?)<br/>
<br/>
So often, assigned reading tends to be what some adult deemed <br/>
appropriate or interesting to kids that age -- when some kids that <br/>
age would find it totally uninteresting.  Blah.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oooh, so you just have to convince your sister to homeschool.  <br/>
Remind her that, um, really, she is with all the extras the teachers <br/>
are throwing at her to do at home anyway.  And she is getting the <br/>
worst of both worlds, too -- she has to do all that assigned yucky <br/>
stuff when her daughter is at her tired worst!  Not very efficient!  <br/>
<br/>
Remind her, too, how much is learned through play.  In fact, ask her <br/>
to think back to her own schooling, and what she really learned, <br/>
still remembers, and how she learned it.  It might be very revealing <br/>
to her.<br/>
