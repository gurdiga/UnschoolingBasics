<div id="ygrps-yiv-686720036">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
without wanting to discuss whether or not vaccination is ok or not –  <br/>
I wonder if you know what I could do: My daughter had a vaccination  <br/>
months ago. She didn&#39;t want it (and I wasn&#39;t unschooling at the  <br/>
time), but she was kind of ok with it, but as the needle went in, she  <br/>
moved away, but they forced the needle in. Months later she still  <br/>
complains that it hurts where she had the vaccination. One cannot see  <br/>
anything, but I believe her and I think it must have been because she  <br/>
moved and the needle hurt more than it should have (sidewise inside  <br/>
the arm?). She never had that with other vaccinations. Do you know  <br/>
anything about this, that it can happen, because of the needle or the  <br/>
medication? I imagine there must be a lot of people here who are  <br/>
against vacc. so maybe you know exactly if this kind of side effect  <br/>
can occur and maybe what one could do. I image that our doctor will  <br/>
just say that she cannot see anything and that she is making it up or  <br/>
something. German doctors don&#39;t believe their patients anyway ;-)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294589425">I don&#39;t vaccinate my children for many reasons, one of the foremost<br/>
being that I don&#39;t trust what is IN those damn things. If my children<br/>
really want to be vaccinated one day, they will still have that<br/>
option. I refuse to put toxic ingredients into their small bodies<br/>
without their knowledgable consent.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a tough issue, with no clear answers but if you want a non-vacc<br/>
pov, there&#39;s plenty of good reading out there. I don&#39;t know about the<br/>
pain she&#39;s experiencing but it could be mental thing as well as<br/>
physical. Can you claim religous exemption in Germany?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-288790841">I think we can actually choose to not vaccinate, but they wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
take the children in Kindergarten or such (school? lol maybe that  <br/>
would be a way to keep them at home ;-) no, I don&#39;t think so). I  <br/>
never question vaccination (well yes I did but I came to the  <br/>
conclusion they were good ;-) I know there are many arguments against  <br/>
it, and the biggest argument against it *today* for *me* would be, if  <br/>
my children don&#39;t want it – but that is now. Half a year ago I just  <br/>
didn&#39;t know this existed at all, so I just did it. I haven&#39;t found  <br/>
any information on the kind of pain my daughter is experiencing...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459249227">This kind of reaction not only can occur, it&#39;s common and in the box  <br/>
insert that came with the vaccination. If it&#39;s not a mechanical  <br/>
reaction or muscle damage, it&#39;s possible that she reacted to that  <br/>
particular virus, or if she was otherwise stressed (illness, tired,  <br/>
received multiple virus) she may just have reacted to the chemicals  <br/>
in the shots.<br/>
<br/>
I have two kids with vaccine damage, so count yourself lucky it&#39;s  <br/>
only soreness! if it makes you feel any better, most drs don&#39;t  <br/>
believe their patients, they are indoctrinated (get it, eh?lol! in  <br/>
&#39;doct&#39; rinated) anyway, can you tell all my big kids are gone, and  <br/>
most of the little ones are napping? wow, I hardly know what to do  <br/>
with my time. I always feel like there&#39;s not enough time to do what I  <br/>
want anyway, read some of my book, play video games, surf the net,  <br/>
watch a movie, cross stitch, ATC&#39;s, knit.....ack!!! how do people  <br/>
choose one thing to do? (please note that cleaning was NOT on my list)<br/>
