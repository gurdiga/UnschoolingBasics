Homeschoolers&#39; setback sends shock waves through state<br/>
by Bob Egelko, Jill Tucker, Chronicle Staff Writers<br/>
<br/>
Friday, March 7, 2008<br/>
(03-07) 04:00 PST LOS ANGELES --<br/>
<br/>
A California appeals court ruling clamping down on homeschooling<br/>
by parents without teaching credentials sent shock waves across the<br/>
state this week, leaving an estimated 166,000 children as possible<br/>
truants and their parents at risk of prosecution.<br/>
<br/>
The homeschooling movement never saw the case coming.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At first, there was a sense of, &#39;No way,&#39; &quot; said homeschool parent<br/>
Loren Mavromati, a resident of Redondo Beach (Los Angeles County) who<br/>
is active with a homeschool association. &quot;Then there was a little bit<br/>
of fear. I think it has moved now into indignation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The ruling arose from a child welfare dispute between the Los<br/>
Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services and Philip<br/>
and Mary Long of Lynwood, who have been homeschooling their eight<br/>
children. Mary Long is their teacher, but holds no teaching credential.<br/>
<br/>
The parents said they also enrolled their children in Sunland<br/>
Christian School, a private religious academy in Sylmar (Los Angeles<br/>
County), which considers the Long children part of its independent<br/>
study program and visits the home about four times a year.<br/>
<br/>
The Second District Court of Appeal ruled that California law<br/>
requires parents to send their children to full-time public or private<br/>
schools or have them taught by credentialed tutors at home.<br/>
<br/>
Some homeschoolers are affiliated with private or charter schools,<br/>
like the Longs, but others fly under the radar completely. Many<br/>
homeschooling families avoid truancy laws by registering with the state<br/>
as a private school and then enroll only their own children.<br/>
<br/>
Yet the appeals court said state law has been clear since at least<br/>
1953, when another appellate court rejected a challenge by<br/>
homeschooling parents to California&#39;s compulsory education statutes.<br/>
Those statutes require children ages 6 to 18 to attend a full-time day<br/>
school, either public or private, or to be instructed by a tutor who<br/>
holds a state credential for the child&#39;s grade level.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;California courts have held that ... parents do not have a<br/>
constitutional right to homeschool their children,&quot; Justice H. Walter<br/>
Croskey said in the 3-0 ruling issued on Feb. 28. &quot;Parents have a legal<br/>
duty to see to their children&#39;s schooling under the provisions of these<br/>
laws.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Parents can be criminally prosecuted for failing to comply, Croskey said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A primary purpose of the educational system is to train school<br/>
children in good citizenship, patriotism and loyalty to the state and<br/>
the nation as a means of protecting the public welfare,&quot; the judge<br/>
wrote, quoting from a 1961 case on a similar issue.<br/>
<br/>
Union pleased with ruling<br/>
The ruling was applauded by a director for the state&#39;s largest teachers union.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re happy,&quot; said Lloyd Porter, who is on the California Teachers<br/>
Association board of directors. &quot;We always think students should be<br/>
taught by credentialed teachers, no matter what the setting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A spokesman for the state Department of Education said the agency<br/>
is reviewing the decision to determine its impact on current policies<br/>
and procedures. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack<br/>
O&#39;Connell issued a statement saying he supports &quot;parental choice when<br/>
it comes to homeschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Brad Dacus, president of the Pacific Justice Institute, which agreed<br/>
earlier this week to represent Sunland Christian School and legally<br/>
advise the Long family on a likely appeal to the state Supreme Court,<br/>
said the appellate court ruling has set a precedent that can now be<br/>
used to go after homeschoolers. &quot;With this case law, anyone in<br/>
California who is homeschooling without a teaching credential is<br/>
subject to prosecution for truancy violation, which could require<br/>
community service, heavy fines and possibly removal of their children<br/>
under allegations of educational neglect,&quot; Dacus said.<br/>
<br/>
Parents say they choose homeschooling for a variety of reasons,<br/>
from religious beliefs to disillusionment with the local public schools.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling parent Debbie Schwarzer of Los Altos said she&#39;s ready for a fight.<br/>
<br/>
Schwarzer runs Oak Hill Academy out of her Santa Clara County home.<br/>
It is a state-registered private school with two students, she said,<br/>
noting they are her own children, ages 10 and 12. She does not have a<br/>
teaching credential, but she does have a law degree.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m kind of hoping some truancy officer shows up on my doorstep,&quot; she<br/>
said. &quot;I&#39;m ready. I have damn good arguments.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She opted to teach her children at home to better meet their needs.<br/>
<br/>
The ruling, Schwarzer said, &quot;stinks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Began as child welfare case<br/>
The Long family legal battle didn&#39;t start out as a test case on the<br/>
validity of homeschooling. It was a child welfare case.<br/>
<br/>
A juvenile court judge looking into one child&#39;s complaint of<br/>
mistreatment by Philip Long found that the children were being poorly<br/>
educated but refused to order two of the children, ages 7 and 9, to be<br/>
enrolled in a full-time school. He said parents in California have a<br/>
right to educate their children at home.<br/>
<br/>
The appeals court told the juvenile court judge to require the<br/>
parents to comply with the law by enrolling their children in a school,<br/>
but excluded the Sunland Christian School from enrolling the children<br/>
because that institution &quot;was willing to participate in the deprivation<br/>
of the children&#39;s right to a legal education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The decision could also affect other kinds of homeschooled children,<br/>
including those enrolled in independent study or distance learning<br/>
through public charter schools - a setup similar to the one the Longs<br/>
have, Dacus said.<br/>
<br/>
Charter school advocates disagreed, saying Thursday that charter<br/>
schools are public and are required to employ only credentialed<br/>
teachers to supervise students - whether in class or through<br/>
independent study.<br/>
<br/>
Ruling will apply statewide<br/>
Michael Smith, president of the Home School Legal Defense<br/>
Association, said the ruling would effectively ban homeschooling in the<br/>
state.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;California is now on the path to being the only state to deny the<br/>
vast majority of homeschooling parents their fundamental right to teach<br/>
their own children at home,&quot; he said in a statement.<br/>
<br/>
But Leslie Heimov, executive director of the Children&#39;s Law Center<br/>
of Los Angeles, which represented the Longs&#39; two children in the case,<br/>
said the ruling did not change the law.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They just affirmed that the current California law, which has been<br/>
unchanged since the last time it was ruled on in the 1950s, is that<br/>
children have to be educated in a public school, an accredited private<br/>
school, or with an accredited tutor,&quot; she said. &quot;If they want to send<br/>
them to a private Christian school, they can, but they have to actually<br/>
go to the school and be taught by teachers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heimov said her organization&#39;s chief concern was not the quality of<br/>
the children&#39;s education, but their &quot;being in a place daily where they<br/>
would be observed by people who had a duty to ensure their ongoing<br/>
safety.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507312301">First, to quote Debbie Schwarzer, HSC Legal Team Co-chair:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do we get rid of this case?<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of paths. One is seeking actual review by the<br/>
Supreme Court. HSC and at least several of the other major groups&#39;<br/>
legal teams aren&#39;t in favor of that. Even if you could get the court<br/>
to accept your petition (they only take 3-5% of cases), the chances<br/>
that it will be decided the way you want aren&#39;t real good. It&#39;s a very<br/>
dangerous road to take, because if the Supreme Court were to affirm<br/>
the appellate court ruling on either of the main points<br/>
(constitutional or statutory), there aren&#39;t many options left. The<br/>
constitutional argument, of course, could be appealed to the US<br/>
Supreme Court, but the statutory case about the proper interpretation<br/>
of the California Education Code could not. California Supreme Court<br/>
is the last stop on that road. If that happens, then you have two bad<br/>
choices that I&#39;ll discuss below.<br/>
<br/>
There is another much easier choice, and it&#39;s the one we want, as well<br/>
as the one being trumpeted in the HSLDA petition. You ask the<br/>
California Supreme Court to depublish the opinion, or, in other words,<br/>
have them say that while this might have been the right result in this<br/>
particular case involving this particular set of facts, the court<br/>
finds that the reach of the opinion is overbroad and should not become<br/>
law for the entire state. That is the choice we all (meaning HSC and,<br/>
I believe, the other groups) want.<br/>
<br/>
You get this by filing a letter with the Supreme Court in compliance<br/>
with the applicable rules of court. While anyone can file one by<br/>
stating their interest, we DO NOT think it is an appropriate use of<br/>
grassroots activism. We DO NOT want every HSC member or HSLDA member<br/>
or grandmother or irate citizen dashing off their letters to the<br/>
Supreme Court. There are sober, measured, legal arguments to make<br/>
about why depublication is appropriate, and those arguments are made<br/>
after researching the applicable standards, etc. The Supreme Court<br/>
will not be swayed positively by public outcry. In fact, it could<br/>
backfire, and backfire badly.<br/>
<br/>
If the Supreme Court affirms on the statutory points, then the two bad<br/>
choices are to either seek legislation or to do nothing and hope that<br/>
a further case is brought that can involve a better set of facts and<br/>
better explanation of the issues (and reaching a better result). Both<br/>
are very dangerous. Legislation isn&#39;t the answer because of the<br/>
extraordinary strength of the teachers&#39; union. It is unlikely we will<br/>
see any legislation ultimately pass that gives us the freedom we have<br/>
today. And the second choice is dangerous. I know lots of families<br/>
that would make terrific test case defendants -- they&#39;re<br/>
conscientious, they actually get their kids educated, they follow the<br/>
laws. But we don&#39;t get to pick who the family is. As a friend of mine<br/>
said, we couldn&#39;t have gotten a worse set of facts for this case if we<br/>
had a contest.<br/>
<br/>
We are trying to get one or more of the fanciest law firms in the<br/>
state to help us on taking the fangs out of this case. We know what<br/>
we&#39;re doing. Please let us do our jobs.<br/>
<br/>
I would be personally, professionally, and, as a representative of<br/>
HSC, globally grateful if everyone on this list would calm down and<br/>
ask others to calm down. Specifically, I would ask people:<br/>
<br/>
a. Not to write to the Supreme Court or any court.<br/>
<br/>
b. Not to talk to their legislators or make any public statements<br/>
about a need for legislation.<br/>
<br/>
c. Tell their neighbors, friends, lists, groups both of the above and<br/>
to educate them about the choices available and about how panic isn&#39;t<br/>
necessary, marches on Sacramento aren&#39;t necessary, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I wish this were the type of situation where we could put the fury,<br/>
passion and energy of the members of this list to good use. Trust me,<br/>
if we end up having to go the legislative route, we will have that<br/>
situation at some points. But this isn&#39;t that type of situation, and<br/>
too many folks stirring things up hurts instead of helps.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>

<br/>
We are extremely likely to end up with a homeschooling law that  <br/>
requires annual standardized testing and oversight by local school  <br/>
district officials. That is what the state DOE is going to push for  <br/>
and it is a popular position here.<br/>
We&#39;re WAY better off if we can go back to the status quo before this  <br/>
court decision. No homeschool law, we are private schoolers and  <br/>
private school is unregulated.<br/>

If we end up stuck fighting a legislative battle, we&#39;re ready and  <br/>
willing to fight it. But going for depublishing the recent decision  <br/>
isn&#39;t because it is the easy way out, it is the superior way in that  <br/>
it leaves us with more freedom.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s exactly why I get so frustrated with HSLDA and their tactics.<br/>
They&#39;ve done so much harm with their &quot;sky-is-falling&quot; crap.<br/>
<br/>
I had a chance to hang out with Mary Griffith this weekend at the<br/>
InHome conference. She&#39;d been part of HSC for many years and is very<br/>
aware of the background on some of the reasons this case exploded the<br/>
way it did. Very enlightening. A lot of it has to do with some guy who<br/>
wanted to be the next Michael Farris and promote his own organization<br/>
to &quot;help&quot; homeschool families.<br/>
<br/>
I think people who start big organizations in order to represent such<br/>
diverse groups like home/unschoolers end up causing more harm than<br/>
good much of the time. The essence of the unschooling movement is<br/>
about personal responsibility and doing it for yourself. Anytime<br/>
someone comes in wanting to &quot;certify leaders&quot; or have people pay a<br/>
yearly membership for some organization, I think you should question<br/>
their motives deeply. Their are some good advocacy groups out there,<br/>
like NHEN. But when the organization is largely about promoting a<br/>
certain individual as a &quot;leader&quot;, that&#39;s when my eyebrows go up.<br/>

So her stance is that strangers have a greater &quot;duty&quot; to ensure <br/>

-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The abusers tend to have a huge legal team on their side, defending <br/>
their rights to treat and educate their children as they see fit. <br/>
*THEY* see my choice to *unschool* and give my children choices as <br/>
abusive and neglectful.<br/>
<br/>
The general public views unschooling as neglectful because we&#39;re not <br/>
requiring that the kids do seatwork and chores.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Abuse&quot; is illegal in each state, but corporal punishment is NOT. Where <br/>
do you draw the line? The courts give it a LOT of leeway.<br/>
<br/>

Personally I would think that requiring<br/>

<br/>
And this is something that you feel should be required? Assigned? <br/>
Regulated?<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s a HORRIBLE idea.<br/>
<br/>
Plus---do you think people wouldn&#39;t find ways around this? Or ways to <br/>
hide abuse? Parents with things to hide would figure out how to hide <br/>
evidence or miss appointments. Doctors don&#39;t even catch all the abuse <br/>
that passes before them already!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The fact that people think like this scares the crap out of me! Yeah,<br/>
have more governmental interference in our freedom of choice, THAT<br/>
always fixes everything right? Hell NO!<br/>
<br/>
Some of us have a big enough uphill battle to fight in giving our<br/>
children freedom of choice over their bodies by not vaccinating. Can<br/>
you imagine what would happen if the above were made legal. How easy<br/>
it would be for government to make homeschooling illegal?<br/>
<br/>
Freedom of choice means that some people will choose badly. It doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean the entire population should have government regulations shoved<br/>
down their throat in order to reign in the abusers. It wouldn&#39;t work<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Also, some of us choose not to use modern medicine as our first line<br/>
of defense. Should my choice for an alternative practitioner be<br/>
ignored? Heck, we haven&#39;t even done yearly teeth cleanings! The<br/>
implications of the above statement are fairly creepy to me.<br/>
Especially if you consider how much our country has happily given up<br/>
freedoms under the Patriot Act. Yuck, ptooey, gag...that&#39;s what I say.<br/>

wrong. Adding to the vaccinations choices, just think of the false<br/>
implications of neglect and abuse that would come up.  Could you<br/>
imagine having your child&#39;s every cut, bruise, and lack of academics<br/>
scrutinized?!?!!?  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s bad enough in my state, that enrolling to homeschool requires<br/>
that we prove our children NOT disabled, instead of proving they are.  <br/>
<br/>
Scary thing is, too many people think like this.</div>

This is exactly how HSLDA has screwed up so many state laws! They love<br/>
to make claims about how they helped make homeschooling legal in every<br/>
state. Whoop-te-doo! They encouraged laws where there were NONE. Being<br/>
non-regulated is the best option for homeschoolers. Read the law in<br/>
Alaska. It states all the compulsory schooling laws and at the very<br/>
end it basically says &quot;unless the child is homeschooled&quot; thereby<br/>
making homeschoolers UNregulated. There is NO law for them. Good.<br/>
<br/>
We are such a law-driven country. People forget that no law means no<br/>
oversight and the freedom to pursue homeschooling in their own way.<br/>

Can the majority of CA schooled children pass a standardized test? With <br/>

But the statement made by Leslie Heimov here, if taken seriously, would<br/>
imply that we cannot afford to leave children alone with their parents<br/>
(!):<br/>
&lt;&quot;But Leslie Heimov, executive director of the Children&#39;s Law Center<br/>
of Los Angeles,(...) said her organization&#39;s chief concern was not the<br/>
quality of the children&#39;s education, but their &quot;being in a place daily<br/>
where they would be observed by people who had a duty to ensure their<br/>
ongoing safety.&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So her stance is that strangers have a greater &quot;duty&quot; to ensure <br/>
children&#39;s safety than parents.<br/>
<br/>
This statement ALONE should send up zillions of red flags.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What to do about the possibility that some parents might use<br/>
homeschooling to isolate and abuse their children in privacy is a<br/>
difficult question that it seems to me the homeschooling community has<br/>
not been willing to address.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The abusers tend to have a huge legal team on their side, defending <br/>
their rights to treat and educate their children as they see fit. <br/>
*THEY* see my choice to *unschool* and give my children choices as <br/>
abusive and neglectful.<br/>
<br/>
The general public views unschooling as neglectful because we&#39;re not <br/>
requiring that the kids do seatwork and chores.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Abuse&quot; is illegal in each state, but corporal punishment is NOT. Where <br/>
do you draw the line? The courts give it a LOT of leeway.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Personally I would think that requiring<br/>
*all* children to have yearly doctor exams, partly to detect signs of<br/>

<br/>
The fact that people think like this scares the crap out of me! Yeah,<br/>
have more governmental interference in our freedom of choice, THAT<br/>
always fixes everything right? Hell NO!<br/>
<br/>
Some of us have a big enough uphill battle to fight in giving our<br/>
children freedom of choice over their bodies by not vaccinating. Can<br/>
you imagine what would happen if the above were made legal. How easy<br/>
it would be for government to make homeschooling illegal?<br/>
<br/>
Freedom of choice means that some people will choose badly. It doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean the entire population should have government regulations shoved<br/>
down their throat in order to reign in the abusers. It wouldn&#39;t work<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Also, some of us choose not to use modern medicine as our first line<br/>
of defense. Should my choice for an alternative practitioner be<br/>
ignored? Heck, we haven&#39;t even done yearly teeth cleanings! The<br/>
implications of the above statement are fairly creepy to me.<br/>
Especially if you consider how much our country has happily given up<br/>
freedoms under the Patriot Act. Yuck, ptooey, gag...that&#39;s what I say.<br/>

<br/>
Why would that be considered &quot;noble&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
How would such a ruling work? Only homeschooled students must see a <br/>
doctor? Why not schooled kids? Why not ALL kids? Until what age?<br/>
<br/>
Who pays for the office visit? The state? What about poor kids? Do you <br/>
get the same exam at a free clinic, or is it &quot;safer&quot;  to go to a <br/>
private practice doc or the hospital or a Doc-in-the-Box? OH! Maybe <br/>
they could put a doc in the *school* and I&#39;d have to go *there*!<br/>
<br/>
Once a year? Twice a year? Monthly?<br/>
<br/>
If I regularly beat my child and avoided bruises (there are books and <br/>
websites that tell you how to do that!), would I *really* get caught? <br/>
What if I just avoided beating him in April &#39;cause his yearly check-up <br/>
was in May?<br/>
<br/>
I could threaten to withhold the X-box if he even attempted to say <br/>
something to the doc about the daily abuses hurled at him.<br/>
<br/>
What if my child is afraid of doctors?<br/>
<br/>
What if they required that I immunize? What if they threatened to call <br/>
that neglect/abuse?<br/>
<br/>
Oh! My dad&#39;s a doctor---could I ask him to do the exam? What about all <br/>
the spankings he gave me---with a belt. Naw---he wouldn&#39;t consider that <br/>
abuse...or would he?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bringing the medical profession into an educational issue is the <br/>
problem. It&#39;s a problem in the FIRST place with the CA family. Was it a <br/>
homeschool problem or an abuse problem? The only way they are related <br/>
is that a homeschool family *can* hide abuse.<br/>
<br/>
And families of schooled kids can&#39;t. &lt;snort&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone needs to be &quot;noble.&quot; I think people need to be <br/>
realistic. Address the *individual* problem and don&#39;t make problems <br/>
where there aren&#39;t any.<br/>
<br/>
California will figure it out. They have really, really smart people <br/>
working on it. It most likely won&#39;t be the status quo, but they will <br/>
deal with it.<br/>

<br/>
   I would wonder whether Mark is familiar with an exam designed to rule out sexual abuse, and how a child experiences that exam?  Of course, it is traumatic. I wonder if he realizes that the vast majority of physical and sexual abuse is undetectable on physical exam, even by experienced experts (which most doctors aren&#39;t).   I wonder if he knows that most abused children are actually in school and have interfaced with doctors for years before the abuse is detected?  I would wonder if he has ever been involved with referring cases to social services?  Most teachers, nurses and doctors with a few years&#39; experience have stories about the horrors of the system, frequently resulting in kids being left in unsafe environments, and sometimes removed traumatically from safe environments.  And the staff of social services may or may not have good training, or resources, or compassion. Ditto anyone else assigned to these proposed compulsory exams, doctors and<br/>
 nurses included.  There is no evidence that homeschooling is associated with increased rates of child maltreatment.  So we would subject *all* kids to an invasive, assaultive yearly exam in order to involve them and their fates in an acutely flawed system?  Why not just snatch all the kids from their parents at birth, then.  This idea is the proverbial &#39;going after a housefly with a bomb&#39; but can gain momentum if not carefully examined.  Whew!

Thank goodness for the snort above. To re-iterate, the vast majority of truly abused kids attend schools and doctors appointments for years before anything is detected. Often, it&#39;s never detected, by the report of abused adults.  So schools and doctors offer NO protection. Cameron <br/>

Not to mention that 1.) absue does occur before school age so when do<br/>
you start these? and 2.) this requires that you tell your kid what the<br/>
exam is for and why regardless of their emotional readiness.  My boys<br/>
are 11 and 9 and I don&#39;t know that they know some parents have sex<br/>
with their own kids.  I certainly haven&#39;t told them that.  They know<br/>
there is abuse but I&#39;m pretty sure they think it&#39;s limited to beatings<br/>
etc...and that sex doesn&#39;t enter into it.  I CERTAINLY wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
wanted to have to sit with a 7 yr old and explain it to them.  And as<br/>
a parent I should decide when my children are emotionally ready for<br/>
really horrific stuff not the state.<br/>

We are Jewish and my boys only know the most general facts about the<br/>
Holocaust.  I can&#39;t even begin to imagine the pain learning about Dr<br/>
Mengele would bring.  John may be able to process it, but Liam would<br/>

information if at all, and how, with my children in the lead not<br/>
because the state thinks I need to.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They WILL go there. That&#39;s almost a foregone conclusion. Every kid in  <br/>
public school has to take the standardized tests every year. They are  <br/>
used to determine which schools are failing and the schools can be  <br/>
taken over by the state if they keep on failing. School funding  <br/>
partially depends on improvements in test scores, too.<br/>
<br/>
But, anyway, test test test test - that&#39;s really a huge focus and it  <br/>
is what the anti-homeschooling public school types repeatedly call for  <br/>
- they want homeschoolers to have to take the same tests as &quot;everybody  <br/>
else.&quot; (Private schoolers are not required to test, but the public  <br/>
school apologists usually don&#39;t seem to remember that.)<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes - that is the first thing they&#39;ll introduce - annual  <br/>
standardized testing - for sure.<br/>
<br/>
The question then will be - what will they want DONE with the test  <br/>
scores - are they going to just say, &quot;You have to test?&quot; No, they&#39;re  <br/>
going to want &quot;accountability.&quot; The BIG word these days. So they&#39;ll  <br/>
come up with some way that local school districts review our kids&#39;  <br/>
test scores and probably some stupid arrangement where kids with low  <br/>
scores will get &quot;help&quot; from the school district (whether we want it or  <br/>
not).<br/>
<br/>
And, what will they test? Probably exactly what the public school kids  <br/>
are being tested on - the state mandated standardized tests, not tests  <br/>
of our own choice. These include subject-specific tests AND probably  <br/>
the CAHSEE - the High School Exit Exam which every student must pass  <br/>
in order to get a high school diploma.<br/>
<br/>
Here in California, our state legislature is very much influenced (to  <br/>
say the least) by the teachers&#39; unions. Very very much.<br/>
<br/>
Anything we can do to avoid the legislature even thinking about new  <br/>
laws is worth trying and I hope we&#39;ll get a good outcome in court! I&#39;m  <br/>
just saying that the legislature is almost certainly going to require  <br/>
standardized testing IF the legislature does end up involved. We need  <br/>
to be prepared to respond to that possibility.<br/>

<br/>
It might not come to that. But, I think we have to think about all the  <br/>
possibilities and examine them - if it does come down to a legislative  <br/>
battle, not all homeschoolers are going to be on the same page. There  <br/>
will be plenty of homeschoolers who think an annual standardized test  <br/>
is just fine and dandy.  I&#39;d rather send in some proof that my kid had  <br/>
some sort of medical contact sometime during the year - pick your own  <br/>
doctor, include the option for various alternative types of medical  <br/>
practitioners - we could get that written into the law.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m not really for this - heck, it isn&#39;t like we even go to the  <br/>
doctor much - Rosie is 17 and told me she&#39;s only ever MET our doctor  <br/>
once that she can remember.) But, I think it is worthwhile to consider  <br/>
all the trade-offs. Realistically, a doctor visit would be a WHOLE lot  <br/>
less intrusive in our lives than mandatory standardized testing would  <br/>
be.<br/>

<br/>
But, my point is that mandatory standardized testing is a HUGE  <br/>
intrusion - enough that, for MY family, at least, a doctor visit would  <br/>
be just way way way less of a problem.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure why you think we&#39;ll get reasonable laws - we&#39;re the state<br/>
that LOVES to regulate everything. We&#39;re not a particularly &quot;freedom-<br/>
loving&quot; state - not at all.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, but you&#39;re not in the Bible Belt either!<br/>
<br/>
Here, I think we&#39;re allowed to homeschool *because* of the religious <br/>
right. That won&#39;t be any help to you! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think your laws will be reasonable because of you and those you have <br/>
working with you to help make the laws. Your legislature won&#39;t be going <br/>
in blind. They will be *very* informed. Unfortunately, the teachers&#39; <br/>
union will also have input, but they can&#39;t make it illegal.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It might not come to that. But, I think we have to think about all the<br/>
possibilities and examine them - if it does come down to a legislative<br/>
battle, not all homeschoolers are going to be on the same page. There<br/>
will be plenty of homeschoolers who think an annual standardized test<br/>
is just fine and dandy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty who would give *everything* away just to be able to <br/>
homeschool---including mandatory doctor&#39;s exams and testing out the <br/>
wazoo. Those folks are dangerous because they *are* willing to give <br/>
away their rights to many things in order to keep one right.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather send in some proof that my kid had<br/>
some sort of medical contact sometime during the year - pick your own<br/>
doctor, include the option for various alternative types of medical<br/>
practitioners - we could get that written into the law.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s dangerous. That&#39;s asking for trouble.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m not really for this - heck, it isn&#39;t like we even go to the<br/>
doctor much - Rosie is 17 and told me she&#39;s only ever MET our doctor<br/>
once that she can remember.) But, I think it is worthwhile to consider<br/>
all the trade-offs. Realistically, a doctor visit would be a WHOLE lot<br/>
less intrusive in our lives than mandatory standardized testing would<br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know I feel the same way about testing as you do. But there are <br/>
several states (NC and GA for example) which require testing for <br/>
homeschoolers, and it&#39;s as painless as it can be.<br/>
<br/>
A whole lot less painful than doctors and DSS.<br/>

&gt; I would wonder whether Mark is familiar with an exam designed to rule out<br/>
&gt; sexual abuse, and how a child experiences that exam? Of course, it is<br/>

************************************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention that 1.) absue does occur before school age so when do<br/>
you start these? and 2.) this requires that you tell your kid what the<br/>
exam is for and why regardless of their emotional readiness. My boys<br/>
are 11 and 9 and I don&#39;t know that they know some parents have sex<br/>
with their own kids. I certainly haven&#39;t told them that. They know<br/>
there is abuse but I&#39;m pretty sure they think it&#39;s limited to beatings<br/>
etc...and that sex doesn&#39;t enter into it. I CERTAINLY wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
wanted to have to sit with a 7 yr old and explain it to them. And as<br/>
a parent I should decide when my children are emotionally ready for<br/>
really horrific stuff not the state.<br/>
<br/>
We are Jewish and my boys only know the most general facts about the<br/>
Holocaust. I can&#39;t even begin to imagine the pain learning about Dr<br/>
Mengele would bring. John may be able to process it, but Liam would<br/>
be devastated. It&#39;s for ME to decide when to offer traumatic<br/>
information if at all, and how, with my children in the lead not<br/>
because the state thinks I need to.<br/>
