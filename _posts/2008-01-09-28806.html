been lurking, so I thought now would be a good time to post an intro. <br/>
My name is Mandi and I have 2 little girls, ages 2 and 5. We are just <br/>
beginning our unschooling journey, so I am really excited about finding <br/>
this group to help us along. I look forward to talking with you all!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-274489724">Welcome Mandi~<br/>
<br/>
We also have 2 girls aged 5 (and a half) and 2 (and a quarter)...one<br/>
of the reasons we decided to not do the school route was when we<br/>
realized that they would never be in school together until one year of<br/>
HS (we have K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12 public schools here)...I love that<br/>
they are getting to spend more time together than just the rushed<br/>
moments after school, between homework, and before bed.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your journey!<br/>
