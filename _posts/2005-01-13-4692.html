<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012525936">My ds loves to visit pet shops.  At our fave one, he can handle the bunnies; there are myriad fish and birds, snakes, reptiles, rodents....and the folks there are glad to answer his questions and will get things out and let him touch.  <br/>
 <br/>
You can visit the shelter, or horse, or chicken or dairy farms.  All the farmers we have visited have been real cool to let us get our hands on and full of interesting information.<br/>
 <br/>
We visit a nursing home that has bunnies, birds, aquariums, dogs and cats indoors, and a pig in the courtyard.<br/>
 <br/>
And we watch the squirrels and the bugs and spiders and birds in our yard.  DS uses binoculars and magnifying lenses and we even have a telescope on our front porch that we use for looking at birds across the river.  We also made a big brush pile after Hurricane Ivan that we have left standing, because it is a habitat; we have seen various tracks and other signs, and quick glimpses of critters crawling within or darting home...not to mention frequent eyes in the dark.<br/>
 <br/>
We watch the neighborhood dogs and our cat.<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes geese come and hang out.<br/>
 <br/>
We visit all our regional zoos and (and we have definite favorites).  Anytime we are travelling we stop at the zoos, as well as travelling to zoos.  <br/>
Also visit aquariums.<br/>
 <br/>
Will also loves reading about animals and in particular loves a really heavy, fat Animals of the World, which includes broadly all animals.  He also always enjoys field guides.  We look up the tracks that we find in the mammal book.  He always has many questions and these books provide immediate answers.<br/>
 <br/>
Animal Planet, Discovery, PBS  (Zoobomafoo is amazing), and videos from the library provide lots of exposure to animals, if only in the imagination.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, we have frequently hung out with wild animals: a turtle we saved from the road (Henry stayed with us for months); a tree frog we caught in Will&#39;s room; lizards who lived on our porch (friends who we have always returned to their natural homes).<br/>
 <br/>
Our life is filled with animals, though we only have one dog and one cat.  <br/>
<br/>
HTH,<br/>

(also still waiting to adopt a puppy).<br/>

 <br/>
We HAVE a Dog with a Job----or at least a *future* job. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re raising a guide dog puppy with Southeastern Guide Dogs. If you&#39;re an  <br/>
Animal Planet devotee---you might see some of the pups in the prison system <br/>
with  the inmates? Little royal blue jackets?<br/>

puppies?  You keep bees?  You plan conferences?  I  could never keep up with <br/>
you Kelly!  LOL<br/>

Well, we have our own. He&#39;s not in the prison system! &lt;G&gt; But we get  our <br/>
dogs from the same folks (SEGDI) and give them back to train as guide  dogs. He&#39;s <br/>
a vizsla named Ryan.<br/>

 <br/>
&lt;G&gt; I have a *really* high energy level and can be a bit manic at  times. <br/>
Seems the more I *do*, the more I *can* do! &lt;g&gt; The less I do, the  less I *want* <br/>
to do, which can lead to depression! :-( <br/>
 <br/>
 Better to be manic! LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-210879411">Millie, thank you for all the ideas! The web sites of the farms <br/>
around here are rather intimidating--they seem to be about Structured <br/>
Educational Programs for School Kids, but maybe if we just show up in <br/>
winter we&#39;ll find helpful friendly people.<br/>

be fed oats and carrots, cats, etc.<br/>
