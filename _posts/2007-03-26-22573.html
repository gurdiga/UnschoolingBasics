<div id="ygrps-yiv-747703295">Hi, <br/>
I&#39;m hoping someone can recommend some good books to teach me what to do <br/>
about my dd 11 and ds 9 being so cruel to each other in their daily <br/>
conflicts. I&#39;m just learning this new parenting style, having been <br/>
raised in a strict traditional parenting style, and have raised my own <br/>
almost the same way,up until about a month ago. DH is very much the <br/>
traditional authoritarian parent still, so I also have that hurdle to <br/>
overcome. Since I started not disciplining them, they are just calling <br/>
names more, even hitting each other, and once, dd BIT ds finger! I keep <br/>
falling into my old patterns, and sometimes yell at them. DS is very <br/>
sensitive, so he ends up crying and angry. I want to buy Siblings <br/>
Without Rivalry, but would like more suggestions if you all have them.<br/>
Thanks in advance for the help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have been through similar things with my two oldest, now almost 9<br/>
and 11yo, both boys. Definitely Sibs Without Rivalry helped, also<br/>
Raising Your Spirited Child is wonderful and helped me see my children<br/>
in Entirely different light.<br/>
 My husband was brought up with extremely strict and sometimes harsh<br/>
discipline, both at home and then in boarding school from age 9 to 15<br/>
in India. At times I thought he would never embrace a gentler<br/>
approach,would not read the books no matter how much I told him it<br/>
would help. But eventually with a kind of agreement that he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
step in with harsh discipline if I used some of the other techniques<br/>
from the books he could see a change and he also began to change. Life<br/>
is much more peaceful now.<br/>
My husband just reminded me about books by Steve Bidulph, an<br/>
Australian writer. He wrote Raising Boys,excellent!! Also wrote a book<br/>
called Manhood which is wonderful. I have some friends who borrowed<br/>
the book, thought they misplaced it and then found it in her husbands<br/>
home office after he said he wouldnt read anything she suggested!!<br/>
Also Alfie Kohn wrote Unconditional Parenting and Punished By Rewards,<br/>
wonderful challenge to traditional styles of how kids are raised.<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-649836197">Another book which I actually haven&#39;t read, although I&#39;ve heard the author speak is Peaceful Parenting by Naomi Drew.  I know she talks about family meetings which may be a good venue for you to discuss with your children (and your husband;-) how you want to treat one another.  I think this is a book that will be more aimed at families with somewhat older children like yours rather than little ones.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is there a particular &quot;method&quot; you are using so far, when you <br/>
say &quot;new parenting style&quot; or is that what you are looking for? Have <br/>
you talked with the kids about what you are doing and why or just <br/>
said &quot;no more rules, no more punishment&quot;? What do they think of the <br/>
idea?<br/>
<br/>
*Siblings without Rivalry* is a good place to start. It would <br/>
probably also be a good idea to start holding the expectation that <br/>
you will be spending a LOT of time with your kids for awhile, <br/>
helping them figure out how to communicate and learn to problem <br/>
solve and resolve conflicts. At this point, they are back to having <br/>
the social skills of two year olds - you took away the &quot;rules&quot; but <br/>
they haven&#39;t had the chance to learn the kinds of skills people need <br/>
to get along with each other without those rules. No wonder they are <br/>
hitting and biting and name-calling!<br/>
<br/>
Let everything else go, if necessary, and focus on building a new <br/>
family relationship. Let the kids know that *you* are learning this <br/>
too, right along with them. Ask them if they would like to read the <br/>
book with you or read on some websites about different ways to get <br/>
along. Actually, if the kids are interested in doing some reading <br/>
(or having you read to them) I totally recommend *Parenting a Free <br/>
Child* by Rue Kream. I recommend it anyway - its a wonderful look at <br/>
how an unschooling family works. <br/>

    This is something w/ 4 children i think i know all about.I tell my <br/>
children if<br/>
they can&#39;t get along they have to ONLY play with the one that there <br/>
having<br/>
trouble with,you&#39;ll be amazed how quick they&#39;ll be nice to one another <br/>
if they<br/>
only have each other to play with.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t have children who fight or even spat. They are eight years <br/>
apart, and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a big part of it! But I DID have a brother <br/>
who is 15 months younger. I know how hard it was to deal with a mean <br/>
sibling.<br/>
<br/>
So in your scenario: if I had a spat with my brother (4-5 and more <br/>
daily), I would not be allowed to play with anyone else until we could <br/>
play nicely together? I would have to play with the mean one who just <br/>
hit me in the head with a phone---that was after he pushed me back in <br/>
the big chair which knocked all the breath out of me.<br/>
<br/>
First I&#39;d be pissed at my parents for lacking in skills to protect <br/>
*me*. I&#39;d resent that they ever thought that giving me a sibling was by <br/>
any remote stretch of the imagination was a *good* thing. I would quit <br/>
talking to that little asshole.<br/>
<br/>
These are still my reactions to having to deal with my brother when we <br/>
were little. We don&#39;t speak often. We&#39;re remote parts of each others&#39; <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
What I wish my parents had done: they should have protected me. Kept us <br/>
apart. Work on communication skills we could have employed.<br/>
<br/>
What they did was let us work it out alone a LOT. I usually received <br/>
the bigger bruises---he was MEAN! If we were really bad, we were <br/>
spanked with hairbrushes, switches, flyswatters, and belts as well as <br/>
their hands. When we got too old to be hit,  we were put in hard-back <br/>
chairs to sit until we were released. (the prototype of the <br/>
time-out---waaay before it&#39;s time.) Sooo as punishment for hitting and <br/>
being mean....ummmm we were hit and were ignored. Go figure!<br/>
<br/>
What we NEEDED were strategies and comfort and time aWAY from the <br/>
meanie.<br/>
<br/>
Because of my lousy relatonship with my brother, I didn&#39;t want Cameron <br/>
to have siblings. That&#39;s almost what I got with eight years <br/>
in-between---gentle, kind, respectful bothers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-278556505">I agree with Kelly and Ren on this one (and pretty much everything else, lol)<br/>
   <br/>
  I had an older brother who was just plain violent.  If my mom would have forced<br/>
  us to &quot;play&quot; with each other exclusively, I&#39;d be dead.  Sad part is that&#39;s not<br/>
  an exaggeration.  Plus, he would have attacked her which he finally did when he <br/>
  was 17yo, after attacking me.  He had one weakness; a sensitive scalp.  Somehow<br/>
  I had managed to pin him by holding his hair at the back of his head, and holding his<br/>
  head down to his knees so he couldn&#39;t hit me.  We danced like that till my mom <br/>
  finally got home and opened the front door.  I yelled for them to leave the door open and move.   I shoved him and ran so fast out the door and kept right on running.  I told her<br/>
  I would never come back as long as he lived there.  She kicked him out then blamed it on me.  The truth was, that when he lost me as his target, he attacked her, and she had finally<br/>
  felt the abuse first hand.<br/>
   <br/>
  This shaped the way I raised my kids.  I don&#39;t believe in hitting my kids and I have never allowed them to hit each other.  This doesn&#39;t mean it has never happened, but it&#39;s been rare.<br/>
  I think groups like this and the books you all have mentioned are very needed in this world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472571572">~~I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU PEOPLE,IF YOU TURN AWAY AND LET CHILDREN KNOW<br/>
IT DOESN&#39;T BOTHER YOU in my EXPERIENCE that&#39;ll make them stop,there<br/>
only doing it in m EXPERIENCE to get attention and there again my<br/>
CHILDREN ARE 2,3 AND 4.~~<br/>
<br/>
This really bothers me on so many levels.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, ignoring my children is not a tool I employ. I assume<br/>
that if they&#39;re doing something to get attention, then I should have<br/>
been giving them attention long before they had to pull out a really<br/>
poor tool to get what they need! If 2,3 and 4 year old children are<br/>
using poor behavior to get attention, why on earth weren&#39;t they<br/>
getting that attention WAY before that? THey&#39;re little. They NEED a<br/>
lot of attention and parental involvement. <br/>
<br/>
Fighting is a sign for more attention, true. But not because they just<br/>
want you to notice them, they need better tools for solving problems<br/>
with each other and they can&#39;t possibly have them at those young<br/>
ages!! So basically, you&#39;re saying the biggest, strongest, meanest<br/>
sibling gets their way? That is horrible.<br/>
<br/>
This list does not promote ignoring children, parents being the<br/>
&quot;queen&quot; of their household (we prefer using methods that are<br/>
consensual and honor every person regardless of age) or any other<br/>
punitive or disrespectful methods.<br/>
<br/>
Those kind of behaviors (on the parents part) really get in the way of<br/>
unschooling. The trust factor needs to be very high for unschooling to<br/>
unfold in the best possible manner.<br/>
<br/>
Kids need to trust that you&#39;ll protect them (even from each other),<br/>
that you see and hear them, that you light up when they come into the<br/>
room and that their needs/wishes/desires will be taken seriously.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend you read the book &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; as soon<br/>
as possible. Your babies need you to be there for them, not ignore<br/>
their most difficult moments. If Mom doesn&#39;t know what to do when they<br/>
fight, how on earth are wee children going to know what to do ? <br/>

fighting is the need for more equitable attention or involvement from me and <br/>

ourselves.  If we are not communicating successfully or respectfully you can <br/>
bet the kids will reflect it right back at us with their interactions.<br/>

it transfers right down the line and will end up directed at my youngest.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids are not getting along i look at what i might be doing <br/>
differently before expecting them to do differently.  Not to say their <br/>
feelings or behavior are *always* my responsibility or i have control over <br/>
them - but most of the time i can make a huge difference to how they feel or <br/>
interact with one another.  Certainly how i respond to their conflict will <br/>
have a postive or negative affect on their ability to resolve it honestly.<br/>

I think your attitude is coming through quite clearly here. I&#39;m sure<br/>
your children pick up on it daily. It&#39;s rough.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re at really good ages for you to make changes before they get<br/>
old enough to turn around and treat you the same way. You&#39;re planting<br/>
seeds for tomorrow. These little people are just adults you get to<br/>
have before they&#39;re adults.:) They&#39;ll remember these interactions and<br/>
when they&#39;re powerful enough to tell you off or move out, they just might.<br/>
<br/>
In my house, we all decide issues. If someone doesn&#39;t like it we<br/>
discuss other options. I have children that get along really well and<br/>
help out very sweetly. We&#39;re all  very close and I know that a big<br/>
part of our relationship hinges on the way their parents treat them.<br/>

CHILDREN ARE 2,3 AND 4.~~<br/>
<br/>
This really bothers me on so many levels.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, ignoring my children is not a tool I employ. I assume<br/>
that if they&#39;re doing something to get attention, then I should have<br/>
been giving them attention long before they had to pull out a really<br/>
poor tool to get what they need! If 2,3 and 4 year old children are<br/>
using poor behavior to get attention, why on earth weren&#39;t they<br/>
getting that attention WAY before that? THey&#39;re little. They NEED a<br/>
lot of attention and parental involvement. <br/>
<br/>
Fighting is a sign for more attention, true. But not because they just<br/>
want you to notice them, they need better tools for solving problems<br/>
with each other and they can&#39;t possibly have them at those young<br/>
ages!! So basically, you&#39;re saying the biggest, strongest, meanest<br/>
sibling gets their way? That is horrible.<br/>
<br/>
This list does not promote ignoring children, parents being the<br/>
&quot;queen&quot; of their household (we prefer using methods that are<br/>
consensual and honor every person regardless of age) or any other<br/>
punitive or disrespectful methods.<br/>
<br/>
Those kind of behaviors (on the parents part) really get in the way of<br/>
unschooling. The trust factor needs to be very high for unschooling to<br/>
unfold in the best possible manner.<br/>
<br/>
Kids need to trust that you&#39;ll protect them (even from each other),<br/>
that you see and hear them, that you light up when they come into the<br/>
room and that their needs/wishes/desires will be taken seriously.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend you read the book &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; as soon<br/>
as possible. Your babies need you to be there for them, not ignore<br/>
their most difficult moments. If Mom doesn&#39;t know what to do when they<br/>
fight, how on earth are wee children going to know what to do ? <br/>

I had an older brother who was just plain violent. If my mom would have forced<br/>
us to &quot;play&quot; with each other exclusively, I&#39;d be dead. Sad part is that&#39;s not<br/>
an exaggeration. Plus, he would have attacked her which he finally did when he <br/>
was 17yo, after attacking me. He had one weakness; a sensitive scalp. Somehow<br/>
I had managed to pin him by holding his hair at the back of his head, and holding his<br/>
head down to his knees so he couldn&#39;t hit me. We danced like that till my mom <br/>
finally got home and opened the front door. I yelled for them to leave the door open and move. I shoved him and ran so fast out the door and kept right on running. I told her<br/>
I would never come back as long as he lived there. She kicked him out then blamed it on me. The truth was, that when he lost me as his target, he attacked her, and she had finally<br/>
felt the abuse first hand.<br/>
<br/>
This shaped the way I raised my kids. I don&#39;t believe in hitting my kids and I have never allowed them to hit each other. This doesn&#39;t mean it has never happened, but it&#39;s been rare.<br/>
I think groups like this and the books you all have mentioned are very needed in this world.<br/>

And so when your children are 17, 16, and 14, do you believe this will <br/>

There are three ways we teach our children:<br/>
<br/>
1) modelling<br/>
<br/>
2) modelling<br/>
<br/>
3) modelling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you think this is the best way to deal with children, just think how <br/>
you will feel when they model that behavior right back to you.<br/>
<br/>
We could all ignore this horrible advice you&#39;re spouting here at <br/>
UnschoolingBasics. We could let you know it doesn&#39;t bother us. What <br/>
would *you* then think? That your advice was acceptable? Probably.<br/>
<br/>
Your children are CRYING---SCREAMING for help. You&#39;re walking away as <br/>
if they are the least important turds in your home. How do you think <br/>
they feel?<br/>
<br/>
When they become teenagers, where do you think they&#39;ll go for solace? <br/>
advice? help? You can be damned sure it won&#39;t be their queenbee mother.<br/>

When they become teenagers, where do you think they&#39;ll go for solace? <br/>
advice? help? You can be damned sure it won&#39;t be their queenbee mother.<br/>

    I don&#39;t know how you were raised but i raise MY children with <br/>
christian morals<br/>
and respect.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Christian morals, but I don&#39;t see that you treat your children <br/>
with any respect.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I teach them that if they can&#39;t handle there own problems and<br/>
various situations than how will they handle the real world.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
ANd yet *YOU* are handling the problems in the household. You&#39;re <br/>
closing your eyes and walking away.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes,they are required to only pla with one another,but if not they to <br/>
me aren&#39;t learning to<br/>
1. get along with All of God&#39;s people and 2. that mommy loves them but <br/>
until<br/>
they as a team can work it out<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They will learn 1) to ignore others&#39; pain and 2) that might is <br/>
right---the bigger, meaner person wins.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
DON&#39;T  bring it to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your job is to protect your children. You&#39;re not doing that.<br/>

Gosh and your kids are what ages?  All under 5years old?  You expect them to <br/>
know how to gracefully work out solutions when most adults don&#39;t seem to <br/>
really know how to respectfully get along with one another very well at all.<br/>

Yes, it&#39;s a touchy subject.<br/>

You&#39;re advocating ignoring children. Not only that, but ignoring htem <br/>
when they need you most.<br/>

that you need to be the QUEEN.<br/>
<br/>
how can you teach your children to look at and change their own behaviour if <br/>
you are not looking at your own attitude and behavior and questioning if <br/>
perhaps its not serving anyone but your own royal highness.<br/>

    Look i don&#39;t judge you don&#39;t know me so don&#39;t judge.I AM <br/>
BIPOLAR,MAM&#39; WHATS YOUR<br/>
EXCUSE?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You chose to post here.<br/>
<br/>
Blaming bi-polar for bad parenting now? I&#39;m bi-polar. But I don&#39;t <br/>
ignore my children. I treat them with respect and trust and I try <br/>
really hard to help them navigate their worlds.<br/>
<br/>
Excuses don&#39;t excuse behavior. We choose how we will react each and <br/>
every moment. We can choose to be mean or igmore our kids. Or we can <br/>
choose to help them through tough times.<br/>

I&#39;m betting your children will quickly tire of being your servants and <br/>
move out of your queendom the SECOND they can get out.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t expect yours to be a long relationship with your kids.<br/>
<br/>
Why should they stay? What would be the benefit of that?<br/>

We don&#39;t know everything. We do know you consider yourself the QUEEN. <br/>
That, if they won&#39;t follow your rules, they can move out. That they <br/>
need to work out their problems with NO skills. That many adults don&#39;t <br/>
have those skills (and where do you think those adults didn&#39;t learn <br/>
them?). We know that you think children of 2,4,& 5 should be able to <br/>
make very difficult decisions already. We know you use a &quot;naughty <br/>
chair.&quot; We know that you believe in Jesus---but I don&#39;t think you <br/>
understood his message to help small children.<br/>
<br/>
Judgment is a GOOD thing. We look at everything in our lives and <br/>
decide---JUDGE---whether it&#39;s good or bad. Whether it&#39;s right or wrong. <br/>
Whether it helps or harms.<br/>
