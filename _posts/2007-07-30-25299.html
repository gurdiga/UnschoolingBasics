<div id="ygrps-yiv-701045571">Hey,<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have the time to read all of your posts about &quot;Why it is  <br/>
positive (or not) not to have a TV&quot; (and I&#39;m ashamed to say that I  <br/>
only read the first of them). I just want to tell you our latest  <br/>
experiences with non-restriction on TV: Our daughter (8) is not  <br/>
watching any TV at all! Only videos she chooses, which we have on DVD  <br/>
or which we rent from the video store. It took 11 months of patience,  <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
It all started almost a year ago, august 2007, when we let go of all  <br/>
restrictions regarding TV (and just about everything). The first  <br/>
months she (7 at the time) would watch TV practically all day (except  <br/>
in the mornings, because of school – some of you know, I&#39;m from  <br/>
Germany and it&#39;s illegal to fully unschool, so she&#39;s there in the  <br/>
mornings, though now in a &quot;free&quot; school with an unschooling  <br/>
approach). She didn&#39;t want to do anything with us of the things we  <br/>
offered, she always chose TV. She sent her friends away who wanted to  <br/>
play with her, because she wanted to watch TV and not miss anything.  <br/>
It was very hard to watch but also showed me, how big the damage  <br/>
already was that I had done! This &quot;addiction&quot; was something *I* had  <br/>
created!<br/>
<br/>
Then we went over a period where she started watching less, but still  <br/>
3-4 hours a day. But she didn&#39;t send her friends away anymore, and  <br/>
everything else but TV was welcome. TV was only to pass the time in  <br/>
between things or when she was bored. But she started to make her own  <br/>
steps towards other activites she could pursue. Also, activities that  <br/>
we offered were welcome again. We experience(d) complaints about her  <br/>
friends coming over and only wanting to watch TV instead of playing  <br/>
with her, because at home they aren&#39;t allowed to watch TV (same with  <br/>
sweets ;-)).<br/>
<br/>
But still, she was &quot;restricted&quot; to the times of the programme. She  <br/>
felt attached to the times her series were shown and couldn&#39;t let it go.<br/>
<br/>
Full freedom came only when we finally followed the advice of so many  <br/>
unschoolers here. We don&#39;t have such a service as TiVo, but we found  <br/>
a TV-&quot;Stick&quot; for the Computer (for Apple computers, called &quot;The  <br/>
Tube&quot;). With this, she could record  and watch later, and also record  <br/>
and start watching just a bit later (time delayed), but still  <br/>
recording in the background. Unfortunately, the programme isn&#39;t able  <br/>
(yet?) to program a recording for later, so one always has to be  <br/>
there to start the recording. But still - these two features alone  <br/>
helped her to get absolutely independent from TV. Our TV is now  <br/>
collecting dust in the cellar!<br/>
<br/>
Now she doesn&#39;t even record anything (I had thought that she would  <br/>
record a lot of things and then see that she couldn&#39;t watch so many  <br/>
things and so on). She doesn&#39;t watch either, maybe once a week. Just  <br/>
to *know* that she will never miss anything anymore gave her the  <br/>
freedom to *choose* not to! Which she may have wanted all the time  <br/>
anyway!<br/>
<br/>
Today she watches 1-1,5 h a day, only videos *she* chooses at the  <br/>
time *she wants*. Even if she went back to watch 5 hours a day, I&#39;m  <br/>
so relieved because now I know, it will then be *her choice* – not  <br/>
the effects of having restricted it before, not because she is  <br/>
dependet from the programme-makers  – just because *she* freely  <br/>
*chose it.<br/>
<br/>
:-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for sparking my background thoughts on this!<br/>
I suspect that folks&#39; opposition to television may, in part, be the<br/>
scheduling idea. I remember having to leave the park to get home in time for<br/>
X to begin, or the kids asking to be awakened for X and if they overslept,<br/>
they were inconsolable after missing their planned show. The VCR helped fill<br/>
the gap at that time.<br/>
My perspective had to change, too, though. When I began seeing their shows<br/>
as important as a playdate, for example, it increased my acceptance. Monday<br/>
nights (8-9pm, january thru may) were once known as &quot;Mommy&#39;s date with<br/>
Kiefer&quot; (actually, we still use that to describe 24!) which was held as a<br/>
sacred time for me to hang out with my favorite TV characters; I&#39;d mommy<br/>
during commercials. Seeing SpongeBob/Simpsons/Family Guy through the same<br/>
lens made it so much easier for me to see their joy and participate in it.<br/>
I&#39;d only talk to them during commercials, too, giving the same respect they<br/>
so happily gave to me.<br/>
Nowadays, however, with the DVR-type technology, cable channels on-demand,<br/>
and full episodes available on the internet -- it&#39;s a moot point. We&#39;re no<br/>
longer a &quot;slave&quot; to the television schedule as it happens. I can pause and<br/>
parent and come right back to my date :D We&#39;ve got a multitude of shows<br/>
awaiting to be seen at the exact moment we&#39;re in the mood. The fast<br/>
forwarding of commercials (or the absence of them, as on the internet) has<br/>
also eliminated the complaints against advert manipulation.<br/>
