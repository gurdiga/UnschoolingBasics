<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019811354">Seth, 11, is going hiking with his Dad for a few days in a couple of weeks. He&#39;s nervous about going - he&#39;s always declined before, when his Dad offered, but this time he said he wants to go. He&#39;s asked his Dad a couple of times if he&#39;s absolutely miserable, if they can leave. His Dad has assured him that, of course they&#39;ll leave, no problem.<br/>
<br/>
I woke in the middle of the night the other night with a fear popping up. His Dad has asthma, and he&#39;s had it well under control for years. It used to be a lot worse when I first met him. He told me of a time that he had gone hiking before we met when he had a terrible asthma attack, and very nearly died. He ended up in the hospital for close to a week. I don&#39;t remember the details - did he drive himself to the hospital? Was he hiking with someone else? I guess that&#39;s not important now. Anyway - my fear is that he will somehow get sick on this hike, and it will be just him & Seth. They&#39;re going to be out of cellphone range for a large part of the hike.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wanting to give Seth information about what to do if something does happen to his Dad, but I don&#39;t want to freak him out! I can&#39;t think of how to bring it up. I realize I don&#39;t need to tell him about the other time his Dad got sick (just realized that in writing this, boy it helps to write stuff out!) and I can just present it as information. &quot;Hey, since you&#39;re going hiking, here&#39;s information you need.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That feels so unnatural when I write it out! &quot;Present information&quot;, etc. I guess my fear is getting in the way of our flow! A healthy friend recently died suddenly with a stroke; I think that&#39;s got my awareness on &quot;Anything can happen!&quot; His Dad is mostly healthy - but so was my friend. He had recently run the Boston Marathon!<br/>
<br/>
All right, so in the flow of our conversation, I can bring it up - not even specifically about his Dad, just &quot;stuff you need to know when you go hiking&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve mostly worked it out in this post, so thanks for being here! If you have additional thoughts or insights, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762849618">Exactly (what you worked out as you wrote it out). Both DH and I have<br/>
health issues. I work fulltime so DS (12) is home with DH while I&#39;m at<br/>
work. In addition to health issues (pre-existing stuff) there&#39;s all<br/>
sorts of accidents that can happen - DH gets hurt mowing the lawn, for<br/>
example. We have explained, over time, in developmentally appropriate<br/>
ways, how to help should it be needed, where the first aid stuff is, how<br/>
to contact first responders and me. For example, DS knows that if my<br/>
blood sugar goes low, I need something quick sugary and he knows where<br/>
the glucose tablets are and what they look like (I always carry some<br/>
within reach). There have been a couple times when I&#39;ve been home and<br/>
tested (felt weird) and said &quot;My blood sugar is low&quot; and DS went and<br/>
mixed up a quick half glass of chocolate milk (which is actually a good<br/>
option). It was something he could do right then, without hunting for<br/>
anything, just react. Knowing both sides of things: what the issues are<br/>
AND what to do about them is important. Without the latter, the former<br/>
is likely to be more scary.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing what to do, having information built in so that there&#39;s not even<br/>
any thinking involved so much as reacting, has really helped DS (and all<br/>
of us) to not be afraid. It&#39;s kind of the same way my mom instilled<br/>
defensive driving tactics in us as we learned to drive. It wasn&#39;t a<br/>
lecture or &#39;scary&#39; thing - just tidbits as she was driving about how she<br/>
kept her eyes out for &#39;what if&#39; situations so she could be ready. Came<br/>
in handy too: I was driving on a two lane back road when the vehicle in<br/>
front of me slipped on ice and spun into an oncoming vehicle. My car<br/>
started to slip and I automatically reacted, bringing my vehicle to a<br/>
safe stop without hitting anything. Can&#39;t say that I consciously<br/>
remember what all I did, I just went into &#39;auto pilot&#39;. (I also sent my<br/>
mom a bouquet of flowers that day as a thank you) Both DH and I have<br/>
CPR/AED training and once DS is physically big enough to handle the<br/>
physical aspects of it, he&#39;ll have the opportunity to take the same<br/>
training as well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure that his dad, if he&#39;s an experienced hiker, has a properly<br/>
stocked first aid kit in his gear. That might be another touch point to<br/>
include - have him show Sean where the first aid kit is and how it&#39;s<br/>
laid out (band aids here, bug bite stuff here, and so on) and that would<br/>
be a perfect time for him to mention where he keeps his asthma meds as<br/>
well. That would be a good addendum to whatever information you provide<br/>
for him, kind of building a coherent whole of the information.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959139908">Oh BTW we&#39;ve also had lots of discussions of &#39;scary&#39; stuff for other<br/>
reasons too: FIL was very sick for several months before he passed away<br/>
a couple years ago (including kidney dialysis - we went to visit when he<br/>
was hooked up to the dialysis machine and the nurse on duty was glad to<br/>
show us a cut away model of the filter and explain all the tubes and<br/>
equipment); my dad had a heart attack and bypass surgery a few years<br/>
ago; my mom had yet another heart surgery last year; DH was hospitalized<br/>
with what they said was a TIA (mini stroke) a couple of years ago.<br/>
Through all of it, we made sure to take quiet times together to talk and<br/>
ask/answer questions, pull out the human body books and look up stuff,<br/>
and so on. Funny: prior to my mom&#39;s surgery, they needed to do a cardiac<br/>
catheterization. So, I was explaining that to DS and he said &quot;Oh yeah, I<br/>
saw that on &#39;House&#39; one time...&quot; That made it much easier to explain -<br/>
he already knew what it looked like, being able to picture it took away<br/>
a lot of the scary unknown. <br/>
<br/>
Information at a level that is appropriate and lots of space to be and<br/>
think and talk and ask.<br/>
