. . . Homeschooling?<br/>
There is a particular philosophy of homeschooling, often referred to <br/>
as &quot;unschooling,&quot; which shares many similarities with the Sudbury <br/>
model. John Holt was its best known proponent, and his writings have <br/>
been invaluable to us in helping to explain just how learning can <br/>
happen without teaching, and why on earth a child might choose to <br/>
learn arithmetic or some other supposedly dreadful subject.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers believe, as we do, that children are born curious about <br/>
the world and eager to succeed in life and that kids learn best <br/>
through experience and experimentation rather than by being told how <br/>
and what to think. In the words of John Holt: &quot;Real learning is a <br/>
process of discovery, and if we want it to happen, we must create <br/>
the kinds of conditions in which discoveries are made. . . They <br/>
include time, freedom, and a lack of pressure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But unschoolers, for the most part, see the family environment as <br/>
the best place for children to grow, while the Sudbury model <br/>
believes that, as the African proverb states, &quot;It takes a village to <br/>
raise a child.&quot; Children and parents have complex relationships and <br/>
interdependencies which make it harder for children to discover true <br/>
independence within the family. In the environment of a Sudbury <br/>
school, children face direct personal responsibility for their <br/>
actions, without the emotional baggage that family-based <br/>
accountability can sometimes carry. In addition, children are more <br/>
able to develop some important social skills in a democratic school <br/>
the ability to tolerate diversity of opinion, to speak out against <br/>
inappropriate behavior, and to develop and carry out group projects, <br/>
for example. In most homeschooling families, the parent sees him or <br/>
herself as ultimately responsible for the child&#39;s education, while <br/>
at Sudbury schools, that responsibility rests squarely with the <br/>
child.</div>

 <br/>
I got a chuckle from this because I don&#39;t live in a village I trust  with my <br/>
child!<br/>
 <br/>
And the vast, vast majority of us do not access to a Sudbury-like school  and <br/>
if we did, we couldn&#39;t afford it!  :)<br/>
 <br/>
On the &quot;village&quot; note, I saw Charleton Heston on Oprah once.  He was  going <br/>
on and on and on about what a great granddad he was and that he drove the  kid <br/>
to preschool and took him to the park.  Then he said nastily &quot;so Hilary  <br/>
Clinton, it does not talk a village to raise a child, it takes a family that  <br/>
cares!&quot;  I wanted to ring his neck, because for the rest of the world that  doesn&#39;t <br/>
have movie stars for grandparents, we don&#39;t have the luxury of leisurely  <br/>
family hanging around to take care of our kids!  <br/>
 <br/>
Sorry I hijacked that....I have just never gotten over that!   LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-459408900">I don&#39;t know about Sudbury schools per se, but I read A. S. Neil&#39;s  <br/>
book about Summerhill in England, which is the same educational model  <br/>
(am I right in thinking the Sudbury schools are modeled on  <br/>
Summerhill? I seem to think I know that from somewhere). I was  <br/>
actually pretty appalled by the book--Neil admits that the freedom  <br/>
kids have at Summerhill had repeatedly led to ongoing abuse and  <br/>
bullying, that kids who were acting out or getting needs met in  <br/>
dysfunctional ways (like stealing) sometimes made life miserable for  <br/>
the other kids. It seemed to me like too much freedom without engaged  <br/>
adult presence.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Neil also said that the school was always getting older  <br/>
kids who had &quot;washed out&quot; of other schools. He said he liked to  <br/>
imagine how different the school could have been if all the kids had  <br/>
come there first, without having to go through any other schooling.  <br/>
That so many showed up at his door damaged by their school  <br/>
experiences diminished the school experience for everyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422860562">The affordability of the school differs from school to school - I have seen<br/>
as high as 11,000 a year to as low as 2,000 a year with payment plans and<br/>
financial assistance. The students and teachers make that decision in daily<br/>
meetings that happen. Everyone who goes to the school - teacher or student -<br/>
get an equal vote in every decision. Each person from age three or four to<br/>
the oldest teacher there is equal.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how every school is ran but most have requirements when you<br/>
must get up (no bed sleeping after a certain time) and there is group meal<br/>
prep but no one is required to eat at a specific time.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to show up for class great but if not there is lots of other<br/>
things to do - reading and computer rooms, walking in the woods, playing a<br/>
game, watching tv, etc.<br/>

I think that it is a great concept - is it perfect, by no means but it is<br/>
made what they want it to be by a collective Democratic manor.<br/>

mentions the destructive behavior but also goes on to clarify that this<br/>
behavior does not last. These are children who come from other schools -<br/>
acting out, don&#39;t know what to do with their free time - they do get it or<br/>
they will get voted out of the school.<br/>

Most schools have a long admission process for that reason. A visit,<br/>

Ah.  Now, I was taking their self-description at face value. <br/>
Obviously, if this is the case, that makes it not such a good choice.<br/>

&gt; bullying, that kids who were acting out or getting needs met in<br/>
&gt; dysfunctional ways (like stealing) sometimes made life miserable for<br/>

with who is running them and location, than with philosophy or methods.<br/>

if only we got the kids earlier, before they&#39;d even been to another  <br/>

<br/>
The Summerhill school didn&#39;t strike me as an especially great place  <br/>
to send a kid. Better than public school? Probably. Better than home?  <br/>
Not by a long shot, at least by my view.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about this since this thread started, and  <br/>
wondering whether if there were a Sudbury-style school around here  <br/>
I&#39;d think of sending my kids. The answer is no. It&#39;s still an  <br/>
institution, and every institution carries the potential for problems  <br/>
with group dynamics. I&#39;ve lived as an adult in intentional  <br/>
communities, and it&#39;s challenging! There are always people who take  <br/>
advantage of the freedoms, people who carry into the group their  <br/>
damage from other settings, people who want to live effectively in  <br/>
community but lack the skills. It&#39;s great if a community responds  <br/>
effectively to such problems (and communities don&#39;t always), but why  <br/>
put my kid through dealing with the problem in the first place? I  <br/>
didn&#39;t put my kids into public school and say, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll pull them  <br/>
out if there&#39;s a problem.&quot; I chose to ensure that they wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
experience that particular set of problems at all.<br/>
<br/>
By the same token, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d put my kid in a Sudbury-style  <br/>
school, thinking, &quot;well, if he gets bullied or abused, or his stuff  <br/>
gets stolen or trashed, the community will respond to that and deal  <br/>
with the trouble-maker.&quot; Why put him there in the first place? Why  <br/>
put him through that if it&#39;s not necessary, if there&#39;s a better  <br/>
alternative readily available? Why expose him to the risk at all?<br/>
<br/>
Even if he&#39;s not a direct victim, one reason I chose not to send my  <br/>
kids to public school is that, even if they aren&#39;t directly involved  <br/>
in bullying, taunting, shunning, they&#39;re going to see it happening.  <br/>
Why make him a witness to something ugly?<br/>
<br/>
Heck, why make him even suffer through the kind of interminable  <br/>
community meetings I&#39;ve wasted so much of my life in &lt;g&gt;?<br/>
<br/>
My own history of living and working in alternative, intentional  <br/>
settings based on ideals certainly colors my reaction to this, but  <br/>
I&#39;ve been there! I&#39;ve thrown my whole self into alternative  <br/>
communities with great ideals, and I have seen and suffered through  <br/>
the ugly reality that often lurks underneath. There are reasons I no  <br/>
longer live in intentional communities, but in my own little house.<br/>
<br/>
Without any direct experience of Sudbury schools, I&#39;m skeptical that  <br/>
they can live up to their propaganda. I disagree with the original  <br/>
blurb, that suggested there are power dynamics in families that make  <br/>
it hard for kids to be independent and self-sufficient, and that  <br/>
Sudbury can do a better job of that. As a PP said, they&#39;re not  <br/>
talking about radical unschooling. Radical unschooling is far and  <br/>
away the best choice for children, in my view. Nothing else could  <br/>
come close.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I also have a whole set of objections to &quot;democracy&quot; as a  <br/>
decision-making model... so clearly I am not the target audience for  <br/>
the Sudbury folks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Su, I agree with you completely. But there is a<br/>
Sudbury school near us - (the original Sudbury Valley<br/>
school) and I&#39;ve thought that if something was to<br/>
happen to one of us, making it difficult to<br/>
unschool/homeschool our kids could go there. It is the<br/>
closest thing to unschooling.<br/>
