<div id="ygrps-yiv-579812879">&quot;I&#39;ve only been deschooling for a few months .....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Its taken me all of the past year and alittle more to stop the worry! <br/>
(and honestly, sometimes &quot;schooling&quot; still creeps back in!)  So give <br/>
yourself more time to deschool.  LOTS more time!  It WILL happen!<br/>
  What helped me, was the threat from the schools to keep records.  <br/>
So I did.  And in doing so, I watched my boys everyday in everything <br/>
they did, and found learning in all of it.  Some things I still can&#39;t <br/>
get into the language of teachers, but I can find learning in most <br/>
everything! (still have to keep records so thats why I mention  the <br/>
language of the teachers). <br/>
  If you haven&#39;t done so already, look up educationese or eduspeak.  <br/>
It can be very very enlightening!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-110668605">We&#39;ve been &quot;deschooling&quot; for 10 months now.  I&#39;m just getting to <br/>
where I&#39;m comfortable with everything.  And, even still, every so <br/>
often things will creep in.  I just continue to remind myself that <br/>
it&#39;s all a normal part of the process.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to add that it is wonderful to see my son becoming his <br/>
true self.  He used to be so shut up and closed off.  He is an <br/>
introvert by nature, but you just wouldn&#39;t believe how much he talks <br/>
now.  It reminds me of how people say about little ones when they <br/>
finally learn to talk.  He talks constantly about everything and <br/>
knows so much.  He&#39;s become VERY opinionated.  :)  I&#39;m still getting <br/>
used to the &quot;new&quot; him.<br/>
<br/>
Sit back, relax, find something YOU like to do.  Everything just <br/>
falls into place.  It&#39;s a beautiful thing!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939928059">Thanks, Tracy!  It still is very strange for me.  He&#39;s gone from one <br/>
extreme to the other.  It&#39;s fun, and uncomfortable at times, to <br/>
watch.  Changes do take time to make and adjust to.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504532581">OH yes I would, I&#39;ve seen the same exact thing in both my boys!<br/>
  My oldest DH had all KINDS of things going on, but he&#39;s done a <br/>
complete turn around being home.  My youngest DH never talked, he&#39;d <br/>
only been to preschool, but I believe it had the same effect that <br/>
school does, he now talks and talks and talks!  ABSOLUTLY refused to <br/>
do any type of &quot;school&quot; work, which is finally ok with me.  Seeing <br/>
them so happy and outgoing and able to go out into the world with me <br/>
and actually speak to other people without lurking behind me wanting <br/>
ME to ask or talk to someone is amazing (something they never would <br/>
have done before). <br/>

But to there surprise we aren&#39;t gonig to pass out the books <br/>
we are however going to graphed out our floor plans for the house to <br/>
help dad make the repairs to our house after the hurricanes.  And <br/>
when that is done we are going to work on hotbeds in the garden and <br/>
compare the bugs that we find with the bug cards that we have oh and <br/>
eat gummy worms at the same time.  Oh and for math we did make a <br/>
special cookie dough that you can sculpture in shapes and bake and <br/>
then eat.  <br/>
Wait! You graph out the floor plans, let them join you if they want. If not, <br/>
that&#39;s ok.<br/>
Try not to think, &quot;for MATH...&quot; just make the cookies for FUN! You compare <br/>
the bug cards, out loud with joy and interest. They&#39;ll hear you (If they are <br/>
outside with you, what if they want to stay inside and do something else?) But <br/>
don&#39;t make it schooly. let these things happen naturally. when something is <br/>
interesting to you, share that interest. Just like you would for a friend or <br/>
spouse, or family member. Avoid looking for &quot;teachable moments&quot; and just LIVE.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908426462">&quot;florida,a stones throw from Ren...i was just curious as i know some <br/>
families<br/>
do the evaluation route,also,,,&gt;&gt;june&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I recommend the umbrella school option...no worries about <br/>
any of that.<br/>
If a family really wants to do the evaluation, I say they aren&#39;t the <br/>
kind of families that are really trusting yet. If you trust your <br/>
children will learn, why do you need an evaluator to tell  you <br/>
they&#39;re ok?<br/>
If the evaluation is simply the choice for that family because it <br/>
makes sense for them, I would tell them to document with photos and <br/>
make a memory book...then take it to an evaluator that understands <br/>
unschooling fairly well. Even during the &quot;deschooling&quot; phase, it&#39;s <br/>
pretty easy to find lots of cool things to take photos of.<br/>
If not, just tell the evaluator that you took it as your vacation. <br/>
No one can tell you which days are &quot;education&quot; days and which <br/>
are &quot;vacation&quot;.<br/>
