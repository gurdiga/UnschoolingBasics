<br/>
It can be chilly in the &quot;outside&quot; pool, where the mainstreamers swim but<br/>
the inside pool (of unschoolers) is big and deep and warm.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***He said that unschooling prepares kids for unliving...&quot; ***<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s saying life is just like school.   It&#39;s not.  School is compulsory,<br/>
kids don&#39;t have a choice about being there.  Jobs are not compulsory.  <br/>
You can choose the kind of work you want to do.  If school is terrible,<br/>
depressing, draining, emotionally hurtful, kids can&#39;t leave.  If a job is<br/>
any of those things we can either ask for a raise to make it worth our<br/>
while to stay, or we can go.  If kids are being hurt or tormented by<br/>
someone at school adults tell them &quot;everyone goes through it&quot;, or &quot;just<br/>
try to stay away from him&quot;.   If someone is tormenting us at work we can<br/>
quit, if they&#39;re hurting us we can have them arrested.  <br/>
<br/>
***kids will have trouble when they want to &quot;go back to the REAL world&quot;.<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
No part of my life since leaving school has been like Algebra class, or<br/>
Geography class.  Not once.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
School isn&#39;t &quot;the real world&quot;.   The real world is this one my son is in<br/>
every day because he never left it to go to school.  The real world is<br/>
where he shops for food at the grocery store, chooses movies at the video<br/>
store, talks to the vet when the cat&#39;s getting a shot, holds the<br/>
Cockatiel at the flower shop when we stop to get something to cheer up a<br/>
friend.  The real world is the world he&#39;s out in hiking and climbing and<br/>
bird watching and fossil hunting.   In his real world he has a job and<br/>
money to spend and places to go and things to do and all kinds of people<br/>
to talk with.   <br/>
<br/>
Some people really believe learning to suffer is good and prepares you<br/>
for all the suffering in life. <br/>
I think being happy is good and our best hope for always being able to<br/>
find happiness. <br/>

I agree.  We also kissed hitting hands or said &quot;ouch&quot; in a gentle  way.   <br/>
Holding the hand and distracting them is good, too.  I try  to give words to it <br/>
sometimes, like &quot;oh, it seems like you are angry because I  did....&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Every one year old I know does this, if it makes you feel better.   Most <br/>
people want to &quot;fix&quot; this behavior, but in my experience &quot;what you   resist <br/>
persists&quot; and he&#39;ll grow out of it (not necessarily overnight!).<br/>
 <br/>
By the way, from his perspective, it is funny to make mommy mad and what a  <br/>
powerful feeling for someone with such limited power!  Around here we call  it <br/>
drunk with power.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-865034934">&quot;***kids will have trouble when they want to &quot;go back to the REAL <br/>
world&quot;.***<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm...my kids have always been part of the REAL world. They&#39;ve <br/>
never been locked up in some stuffy classroom learning about the <br/>
&quot;real world&quot; from a book, instead they&#39;re IN the world learning.<br/>
They aren&#39;t shut away from other ages for most of the day, so <br/>
they&#39;re learning from a variety of people.<br/>
<br/>
I would seriously question your friends dh about how he expects his <br/>
kids to do ok when they drop into the &quot;real world&quot; from the bizarre, <br/>
unnatural world of school:<br/>
 How are they going to deal with a variety of ages in the work place <br/>
when they have been shut up with mostly age peers all day? <br/>
How are they going to know how to do math in their heads when <br/>
they&#39;ve done it on paper for so many years? <br/>
How will they multiply larger numbers when they&#39;ve been forced to <br/>
memorized up to 12x over and over? <br/>
How will they be able to creatively problem solve when they&#39;ve been <br/>
taught there&#39;s one right way to do everything?<br/>
How will they be in touch with their passions and interests when <br/>
they&#39;ve been told to ignore them over and over?<br/>
How will they know when it&#39;s ok to say NO to someone when they&#39;ve <br/>
been taught to obey authority for so many years?<br/>
How will they be prepared for technology when they use so little of <br/>
it in the classroom (no video games!!)?<br/>
How will they have the confidence to be themselves after years of <br/>
labeling, categorizing and comparing them to each other?<br/>
<br/>
I worry about these schooled kids. Your friend ought to worry about <br/>
that rather than your free thinking, joyful learners that are going <br/>
to pounce on life and never look back.:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**My kids aren&#39;t in preparation for anything.  They&#39;re living their lives<br/>
right now.<br/>
<br/>
School kids spend their days in an artificial environment (usually inside<br/>
one building) with the same group of people all the time, doing what they<br/>
are told to do.  Unschooled kids interact with a huge variety of people in<br/>
different situations and locations, and choose for themselves how they want<br/>
to spend their time.  It seems pretty obvious to me which kids are<br/>
&#39;unliving&#39;.  ~Rue<br/>

<br/>
Is it happening because he frustrated and if so, why?  What can you do to<br/>
prevent the frustration.  What other physical thing can he do that will<br/>
expend some energy, can he run in the yard, can he splash in the bathtub?<br/>
<br/>
It will take time.  Be gentle, don&#39;t get mad, hold his little hand and<br/>
say something sweet about being loving to each other.  <br/>
I used to tell Dylan we weren&#39;t the hitting family we were the<br/>
lovey-dovey family.   But then you can&#39;t swat at the dog or playfully hit<br/>
your partner either.  When he sees people swat or hit each other on TV it<br/>
would help to say something like &quot;oh, she hit him, that&#39;s not nice&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Be patient.  He&#39;s little.  Lot&#39;s of big people still don&#39;t know how to be<br/>
gentle with each other.  If you&#39;re consistently gentle with him, he will<br/>
want to be that way with you, too. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I think we assume they understand that hitting is offensive or<br/>
hurtful and I don&#39;t think they&#39;re intending that.  They can thump on<br/>
furniture and toys and the bed and other things around the house and I<br/>
think it takes a lot of experimentation before they understand thumping<br/>
on people and critters is hurtful.  It feels kind of good to hit things,<br/>
soft things like the bed and firm things like the coffee table - it&#39;s<br/>
kind of tingly and different and interesting.  So if you can look at<br/>
hitting as one of the many things he&#39;s learning about and not like he&#39;s<br/>
deliberately being mean to you, that might help you be more patient with<br/>
him. <br/>

My daughter was in ps for 2 years and  she is still<br/>
de-schooling (not to mention me!)...I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
what 12 years could do to the spirit of a child....<br/>
Thanks for your posts...they have been very helpful<br/>
and encouraging as we begin our unschooling journey ;)<br/>
Peace, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556875493">&lt;&lt;&lt;I am so glad <br/>
I went to the conference because I just tell them about Valerie&#39;s <br/>
daughter and her incredible success, Phd, etc. Not necessary, I <br/>
know, but shuts &#39;em up pretty quick. Comments?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Any time an Unschooler, or homeschooler for that matter (remember that<br/>
family where all the boys got scholarships to Harvard) have some kind of<br/>
academic &quot;success&quot; measured in schoolish terms (Oh yeah - spelling bees),<br/>
then the story is grabbed like a talisman. These stories are great to get<br/>
doubting family or friends off your back, especially people who don&#39;t<br/>
*really* want to learn how it works, but feel obliged to share their<br/>
uninformed opinions anyway. <br/>
<br/>
However on this Unschooling list, I think it is important for the sake of<br/>
newbies to reiterate the idea that success for Unschoolers is not defined in<br/>
terms of &quot;getting into college&quot; or &quot;getting good grades&quot; - or to set up any<br/>
expectation that you start unschooling in your home and your child will<br/>
spontaneously start writing book reports, dividing their day into work on<br/>
certain subjects, and doing an hour of math drill college prep on a daily<br/>
basis. This *might* happen, but it is not the goal of Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If parents are constantly focusing on the future, and examining everything<br/>
for signs indicating incipient academia, sometimes the wonders of the<br/>
present are being overlooked. Also I think it is a mistake to assume that<br/>
the possibly temporary interest of a youngster will necessarily become their<br/>
life&#39;s vocation. It seems silly to want to remind people of this, but<br/>
recently one of the school-at-homers in my local support group mentioned<br/>
that her son expressed an interest in Anthropology and Archeology and she<br/>
was detailing her breathless seeming search for colleges that accept h/s&#39;ers<br/>
and was worried about tailoring his curriculum to the college entrance exams<br/>
for this area. The boy is eight.<br/>
<br/>
According to Valerie&#39;s book, Laurie chose an academic life for her own<br/>
reasons, not because it was socially expected, she was unmotivated in her<br/>
life, or she perceived it as her only option. I suspect that most<br/>
Unschoolers attending college do so for purposes of furthering their passion<br/>
or career, and for community of interest (finding like-minded people).<br/>
Probably there is curiosity too.<br/>
<br/>
Success for Unschoolers is often defined in terms of joyous family life and<br/>
close, trusting relationships within the family. When Unschooling is working<br/>
the children are seen to be authentically engaging in their own interests,<br/>
and with any luck so are the parents. <br/>
<br/>
One of the facets of this seems to be a greater respect for privacy. For<br/>
example children are not &quot;required&quot; to share the stories they write with<br/>
their parents or any one else who might want to read them, although they<br/>
often choose to do so. Compare this to the schoolish phenomenon of a teacher<br/>
intercepting a passed note and reading it out to the class, or setting the<br/>
assignment of keeping a journal. :/<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m trying so fuzzily to get at is the idea that the success of<br/>
Unschoolers can be greatest in private arenas. We members of our on-line<br/>
forums where we share daily successes and challenges are few in number<br/>
compared to greater society. It is possible that many of our children will<br/>
end up receiving public accolades for successes in their chosen fields. They<br/>
will be taking the habit of confidently enjoying their activities with them<br/>
into their professional lives. But maybe they will just continue to quietly<br/>
live adult lives as wellsprings of joy enriching only their immediate family<br/>
and acquaintances. Which ain&#39;t too bad either.<br/>

they want is to get into balance again. Being in balance is knowing you are<br/>
OK no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
How about a hug and an &quot;I love you&quot; and an &quot;It&#39;s ok to feel grumpy now.&quot; And<br/>
anything to soothe them back into balance?<br/>

Sometimes I cringe when I hear of homeschoolers winning some big award, or how great they do on tests. Why do homeschoolers (of any kind?) have to be BRILLIANT in order for people to accept it as valid? Why can&#39;t these children be &quot;average&quot; (I hate that word, but for lack of anything better, I&#39;ll use it), just be who they are today, without all these expectations of what society envisions as success?<br/>
ARGH.<br/>
Pet peeve of mine. If they&#39;re happy, connected to themselves and family, and enjoy whatever they&#39;re doing, that&#39;s enough for me.<br/>

unschoolers to share with some people.<br/>
 <br/>
My grandparents are wonderful, sweet people but if I were to say &quot;my kids  <br/>
are happy and connected to themselves and that&#39;s enough&quot; they would immediately  <br/>
think CULT!!!  LOL!  They live far away, we rarely see them and it  raises <br/>
their comfort level to tell them lots of wonderful things that I know to  be <br/>
true about unschooling and then say that I know of kids with PhD&#39;s and go to  <br/>
Harvard.  Harvard they get, and they quit worrying.  I don&#39;t feel the  need to <br/>
convert them.  Homeschooling is hard enough for them to  understand.<br/>
 <br/>
With people who I might actually have a small chance of opening their minds  <br/>
a bit, I focus much more on joyful living and not needing to succeed in the <br/>
eyes  of society to be a successful person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849736599">Right. It&#39;s like beginning and advanced homeschooling explanations. <br/>
At the moment, it&#39;s darn nice that Mikey&#39;s verbal and social skills <br/>
are frightenly good, because it makes it easy for people who don&#39;t <br/>
know anything about homeschooling to see that I haven&#39;t ruined him <br/>
yet by keeping him out of preschool. That&#39;s good for neighbors and <br/>
some family for now. Other people, who can handle the concept of <br/>
homeschooling (including the fact that they aren&#39;t all like the <br/>
Smiths down the street who never come out of their house), might hear <br/>
about unschooling from me and not testing, the bizzare idea of <br/>
helping kids to be happy, etc. if they seem interested.<br/>

That&#39;s a good question. I think it was to contrast with working class or<br/>
broad rural accents also called &quot;strine&quot; (think &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;). Pretty<br/>
stupid really. I remember erudite Prime Ministers whose accents were so<br/>
broad they would have needed subtitles to be understood here, and posh<br/>
sounding socialites who were dingbats.<br/>

No - in my case I would just get stupid(er). I haven&#39;t had a drink for 8 1/2<br/>

<br/>
Well now that little hat has a story behind it. Jayn designed and we made<br/>
that hat together a while ago. She sewed the little doo-dad on the side and<br/>
I sewed on the pearls under her instructions. Then she cut the &quot;ruffles&quot;<br/>
(slits) all around. She was so proud, so I had to wear it. I&#39;m afraid it<br/>
turned out to be a bit distracting in Anne&#39;s keynote-redux. Sorry about<br/>
that.<br/>

about how difficult grad school is, I said, &quot;Well, you know you can <br/>

decided to get a PhD because YOU wanted it, not because you feel <br/>
others want you to get it. If you start feeling that you don&#39;t want <br/>
it anymore, why keep working for it?&quot; She thanked me for reminding <br/>
her about why she&#39;s there. She told me today on the phone that she&#39;s <br/>
remembering better each day that learning is a joy in her life and <br/>
she refuses to turn each assignment into a battle. She said (with <br/>
confidence) &quot;I&#39;ll give it the old college try for at least a <br/>
semester, then reexamine what I&#39;m getting from it all.&quot; <br/>

If she&#39;s not happy with her choice, I&#39;m going to be the LAST person <br/>
to suggest she stick it out. I quit quite a few things in my life, <br/>
and everytime someone scorned my decision, it took me even longer to <br/>
find what I wanted to try next. <br/>
