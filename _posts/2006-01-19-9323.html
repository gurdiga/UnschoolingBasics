<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449861636">Thanks for all the feedback about TV and sugar. I can see that sugar is in a<br/>
different category. It makes total sense to me that a child will begin to<br/>
feel unhealthy after eating too much sugar and will work to balance his/her<br/>
body with better food.<br/>
<br/>
TV, though, still seems like an entirely different beast. My objection to<br/>
watching isn&#39;t that I necessarily think it isn&#39;t &quot;educational&quot;, if I may be<br/>
forgiven for using that word. I still tend to think that it is, in fact,<br/>
somewhat addictive (not like cocaine, but perhaps like marijuana...which<br/>
hasn&#39;t had any studies that unarguably demonstrate it is harmful either and<br/>
certainly it isn&#39;t incredibly addictive) so that it isn&#39;t quite a matter of<br/>
trusting my child to turn it off...I think that perhaps some kids might need<br/>
HELP in turning it off (once it is on in the first place).<br/>
<br/>
And besides the addictive part, I really don&#39;t like that advertisers and TV<br/>
professionals are being allowed into my home freely to seek out my children<br/>
and get them to want things...things that they would not have wanted or<br/>
known about if they had never watched TV in the first place. Not just<br/>
things, either, but ways of talking and acting. Unfriendly, whiney ways of<br/>
acting and talking. Stereotypical ways of acting, like coming to assume that<br/>
little sisters are &quot;a pain and annoying&quot; because that is what is portrayed<br/>
on TV.<br/>
<br/>
So do your kids never ask for things that they have seen on TV? And do you<br/>
really not see any behavior changes that you attribute to characters on TV<br/>
shows? I am asking because I see those things in my kids and the idea of<br/>
letting them watch unlimited TV is difficult for me to imagine. I truly feel<br/>
like I am letting them wander into a forest alone....or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - I won&#39;t post anymore about this topic, but I am interested in<br/>
people&#39;s experience on this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-625879327">I wanted to say something in regards to the topic that your children  <br/>
being exposed to advertising being a bad thing. I think it&#39;s good.  <br/>
It&#39;s good for them to be exposed and want stuff now while the  <br/>
personal cost is low. What&#39;s going to happen if and when they move  <br/>
out? What if they&#39;re twenty, living on their own and discover the  <br/>
HSN? Having never been exposed to that kind of marketing without the  <br/>
loving support of family, what will their response be? My brother was  <br/>
24 when he got ripped off by one of those tv commercials and it cost  <br/>
him lots.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids ask for things they see on tv, we talk about it. I ask  <br/>
why it&#39;s appealing. I ask how they plan on getting it. I offer  <br/>
alternatives, like similar products at local stores. I share  <br/>
experiences I have had with ordering stuff. I sometimes offer  <br/>
comments and experiences when I see ads on tv. Just a few days ago,  <br/>
we saw a cakepan set commercial for a product that I&#39;d been wanting  <br/>
and found at walmart. The girls (ages seven and five) remarked how  <br/>
lucky we were we had bought it there, because not only did it cost  <br/>
more on tv, there was a remarkably high s&h. Josh (ten) bought some  <br/>
set online, and when he got it was grossly disappointed by the  <br/>
quality and how difficult it was to put together. He&#39;s learned a  <br/>
valuable lesson in marketing.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes I just say &quot;why not?&quot; and we look into buying it. I  <br/>
don&#39;t have to lecture about value or cost or saving money. They see  <br/>
for themselves and they are much more cautious next time.<br/>
<br/>
As for attitudes. My kids have experimented with attitudes that they  <br/>
see on TV. It&#39;s a role they try on. If I really feel I can&#39;t tolerate  <br/>
it, then I&#39;ll tell them that the way they are acting hurts me or  <br/>
bothers me because &lt;reason&gt;. The best way is to playact with them,  <br/>
it&#39;s fun, they&#39;ve tried the role on, and it&#39;s no longer appealing  <br/>
(sometimes, the girls are really stuck on British accents right now,  <br/>
with snoots in the air and tail feathers awaving!) And it&#39;s not all  <br/>
bad, the girls have seen a lot of compassion and love and solving  <br/>
problems. They aren&#39;t watching it alone either, and usually when  <br/>
we&#39;re watching someone will make a comment about how so and so was  <br/>
mean, or such and so was a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this will help, we just started the unlimited tv  <br/>
ourselves, maybe a few weeks ago, but we&#39;re seeing changes. Our tv is  <br/>
in a game room that we LOCKED for crying out loud, to keep them from  <br/>
watching tv when we didn&#39;t approve.<br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s such a natural part of development..to mimic. Children<br/>
mimic the adults in their lives, they mimic friends, they try out<br/>
accents and phrases and all sorts of things.<br/>
It&#39;s part of learning and developing their own personality. <br/>
Kinda like trying on different clothes.:)<br/>
<br/>
Eventually they go through that stage and the mimicking wanes....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296000992">This is my experience with the TV advertising.  I do cringe a bit  because my <br/>
oldest is not strong on communication skills so I don&#39;t have the  ability to <br/>
really discuss things with him like other unschoolers might.   But on his own <br/>
as he matures (he is nine now), he seems less and less impressed  with the <br/>
latest newest thing.<br/>
 <br/>
When we first moved to this house about 18 months ago, we got DirecTV for  <br/>
the first time.  My kids were glued to PBSKids, which is a 24 hour station  <br/>
playing nothing but PBS shows and no real commercials.  I noticed a  dramatic <br/>
reduction in the stuff they asked for.  Then when they got bored  of that, they <br/>
started watching the channels with commercials and they did start  to ask for <br/>
this fantastic toy or that one.  We went through a phase of them  desperately <br/>
wanting to go to the store every day for this or that.  We  had a loose <br/>
allowance plan for them and we refined it at that point.   They had a certain amount <br/>
of money to spend (enough for them to get a decent toy  about every week and a <br/>
better toy every two weeks).  Then that phase waned  as they got used to the <br/>
commercials again.<br/>
 <br/>
Sometime in October I saw another huge shift in the asking for this or  that. <br/>
 I remarked to a friend that Christmas must  be coming.....the advertising <br/>
was kicked up a notch!  My kids talked  of fantastic toys that do fantastic <br/>
things constantly.  Christmas came and  they got a good balance of what they <br/>
wanted, some things they didn&#39;t know about  and their own shopping money to get <br/>
what they didn&#39;t get for Christmas.  I  haven&#39;t heard much since then (I know it <br/>
is only Jan. 20th!  but that&#39;s a  long time in kid-years!).<br/>
 <br/>
I grew up in a household where &quot;wanting&quot; and &quot;getting&quot; were loaded  subjects. <br/>
 It wasn&#39;t really considered a bad thing to want something, and  we had huge <br/>
generous birthdays and Christmases.  But, my mom would always  hear that voice <br/>
she grew up with and say &quot;you always get too much, you don&#39;t  need that <br/>
much&quot;.  In her childhood, frugalness was (and still is to much of  my family) the <br/>
ultimate virtue.  Even if someone has plenty of money,  it is frowned upon to <br/>
spend in any sort of flashy way.  Some don&#39;t own pets  as that is considered a <br/>
waste of money.<br/>
 <br/>
I feel like most of us grew up with some level of these ideals and ever  <br/>
since technology met advertising, the allure has increased a thousand fold on  our <br/>
poor children.  That is scary and uncomfortable for most of us...I  don&#39;t <br/>
think we&#39;ve really resolved the frugal vs. abundance thing in our  heads, or in <br/>
our culture.   So are we reacting with a real  concern for our children or <br/>
those familial/cultural voices in our heads?   (By the way, I can&#39;t answer that <br/>
question  :)  )<br/>
 <br/>
I think our kids are going to have to be prepared for a future of  <br/>
advertising even more expanded than we have now.  When we eventually get  Tivo or DVR, I <br/>
will happy to reduce the amount of advertising they are exposed  to, but I <br/>
think it is a mistake to try to act like it isn&#39;t there.  My  kids are learning <br/>
about the power of advertising by seeing that Floam  doesn&#39;t work as <br/>
advertised, not by buying a ton of worthless junk on a maxed out  first credit card.<br/>
 <br/>
I think my kids are going to learn that it is OK to want something, how to  <br/>
budget and save, how it feels to spend your money on something that doesn&#39;t  <br/>
deliver and how it feels to spend your money on something that does!<br/>
 <br/>
My friend with an older girl watches a lot of craft shows with her daughter  <br/>
and they started Tivo&#39;ing them because she was uncomfortable about the sheer  <br/>
number of weight loss/perfect body commercials.  It was at this age that  she <br/>
started her own food/body issues and she is so uncomfortable with the  <br/>
commercials that it made her not want to watch the shows.  She feels she  can manage <br/>
the subject on a smaller level, but the shows geared at women had a  constant <br/>
attack!  The Tivo has been the perfect solution and they have a  great time <br/>
together without the added stress it causes her.<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry so long!  Feeling chatty, I guess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802274610">I was just thinking about this earlier today, mostly because the <br/>
girls have so much stuff right now that I just have trouble managing <br/>
it. What I&#39;ve always heard is that the more you have, the less you <br/>
care or appreciate any of it. For example, if you have twenty <br/>
stuffed animals you might not even notice if you lose one, but if <br/>
you have one or two, you will cherish them and they&#39;ll be very <br/>
special to you.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve ever read The Tightwad Gazette (a very interesting <br/>
compilation of newsletters), the author shares a story about going <br/>
to a garage sale and a boy was selling a TON of GI Joe stuff and <br/>
almost seemed to have a certain disdain for them. She also talks <br/>
about how her kids really appreciate going out for ice cream since <br/>
they do it very rarely. <br/>
<br/>
The idea seems to be that children (and people in general) will <br/>
enjoy life more if &quot;fun things&quot; are doled out in very small amounts. <br/>
<br/>
The other (similar) idea I always hear is that kids will take better <br/>
care of their things and not lose them easily and stuff if they have <br/>
less.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve found this to be true with my kids. They don&#39;t <br/>
seem to have disdain for their toys or life in general. They don&#39;t <br/>
seem jaded or having no appreciation. They have more stuffed animals <br/>
than we know what to do with, but each has about two Very Special <br/>
Friends. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway ... I was just wondering if anyone had any comments on these <br/>
VERY common ideas. Have you seen it in action? Any reason why it&#39;s <br/>
so popular? Any truth to it at all?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564369002">I&#39;ll apply it to chocolate chip cookies (a fav at our house). When I <br/>
make them rarely, because it&#39;s a hot sticky summer or whatever, when <br/>
I do make them, DS is delighted. AND he eats them as fast as he can <br/>
and pines for them when they&#39;re gone. When I make them every week <br/>
(or even twice a week), he still hops all around the kitchen <br/>
grinning gleefully because he knows there are cookies coming BUT he <br/>
can take his time eating them and not be sorrowful when they&#39;re gone <br/>
because he knows there will be more. He operates out of a sense of <br/>
abundance rather than a sense of scarcity/hoarding.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, we were doing some rearranging in his room and suggested <br/>
that maybe he could pick out some stuffed animals of his pile (it&#39;s <br/>
about 3&#39;x3&#39;x3&#39; of stuffed critters of all shapes and sizes and <br/>
colors and textures) that could be donated or given to his toddler <br/>
cousin. He looked the pile over carefully and found -one- that he <br/>
was willing to give to his cousin. Each one is special in some way - <br/>
he won it at a carnival or got it as a gift or whatever. We have a 3 <br/>
ft tall Tigger body pillow like critter that we got him when he <br/>
broke his wrist as a toddler - we&#39;d stretch that along the side of <br/>
his crib so that his cast wouldn&#39;t get caught and he could sleep <br/>
more comfortably. Then there&#39;s Purple Bear - DH won it for me on our <br/>
first &#39;official&#39; date (which was a couple months after we started <br/>
dating lol). It is the holder of hugs and kisses from me to DS when <br/>
I go to work (because it is the color of my &#39;purple part&#39; - the part <br/>
of a mommy&#39;s brain that spends 24/7 thinking about that child - <br/>
every mommy has one or more depending on number of children and each <br/>
one is a different color, mine just happens to be purple). And so <br/>
on. It&#39;s not because he has too few so he must hold them tightly. <br/>
It&#39;s not because he has so many that he&#39;s being acquisitive. It&#39;s <br/>
because they represent his full, rich, loving life and he can&#39;t bear <br/>
to part with the memories.<br/>
<br/>
I think the ideas you mention are so popular because they harken <br/>
back to our Puritan ancestors and the idea that &#39;fun&#39; is &#39;bad&#39;.<br/>
<br/>

PS Pets can actually save money in some ways - they&#39;ve been shown to <br/>
help people stay healthier in many ways (lower blood pressure, lower <br/>
incidence of depression, get people up and moving, etc) and that <br/>
ends up saving money in the long run.</div>

 <br/>
Jenny, my thoughts on this are that these things might have some truth to  <br/>
them, but you can&#39;t force it on someone else.<br/>
 <br/>
My grandmother gave away nearly everything she owned and loved having that  <br/>
freedom.  The problem was she assumed everyone needed or wanted that same  kind <br/>
of freedom.  I would laugh at her and say &quot;it IS useful to me to own  more <br/>
than two pairs of underwear....I don&#39;t do laundry that often and I have no  <br/>
inclination to rinse them in the sink as you do!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
What I do (or try to do) with my children is allow them the freedom to  own <br/>
as much as they would like, within the boundaries of &quot;what makes sense&quot; and  <br/>
budget.  Then lots of discussion about my own spending habits.  The  other day, <br/>
I made an impulse buy that turned out to be a dud.  When a  natural <br/>
opportunity presented itself, I talked about my mistake and that next  time I&#39;ll try to <br/>
think twice about doing it again.<br/>
 <br/>
I recently packed up a bunch of my unused clothing for charity.  My  daughter <br/>
was very upset.  I had to explain to her several times, but she  finally got <br/>
it.  I said &quot;I&#39;m sad to give these things away that I once  loved, but they <br/>
don&#39;t fit me or I don&#39;t love them as much as I used to.   I&#39;m going to give them <br/>
to someone that will be able to love them now.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
My children have a lot of toys and love every single one.  My problem  is we <br/>
have no place to put them all and as a military family, we&#39;ll have to move  <br/>
again before too long.  I&#39;m hoping by then (and with lots of doing this  myself) <br/>
that they will be able to release some of their things.  If not,  we&#39;ll <br/>
figure out a way to manage while still giving them a choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-81362728">Interesting topic.  <br/>
My feeling is that it has much to do with the person themselves and <br/>
how they are being/were raised. <br/>
<br/>
Before I adopted my children, they spent 4 years in the foster care <br/>
system and were given loads and loads of stuff over the <br/>
years...trips, computers, playstations...I&#39;m not just talking about <br/>
inexpensive items. They had more toys and games than any child I had <br/>
known. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not so much different than how we live now...we go places, we <br/>
have video games, we have three computers. <br/>
But the BIG difference is their lifestyle is different now. <br/>
<br/>
Before, they were given stuff to replace love, attention, security...<br/>
They have love, attention & security now and are at different levels <br/>
in allowing themselves to accept it into their lives. <br/>
<br/>
Before, they were never given an opportunity to show appreciation or <br/>
gratitude. They were expected to fill the hole in their heart with a <br/>
trip to Disney...given to them by a faceless company wanting to help <br/>
foster kids.   <br/>
Now, we plan our trips as a family and we talk about how we <br/>
appreciate it and all the fun were going to have. <br/>
<br/>
When my three moved in, they were in the mindset of &quot;getting <br/>
whatever they could&quot;. They only cared about what &quot;we could do/buy <br/>
for them&quot;. Years of foster care had done that to them. <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not all at the same healing level yet so we do deal with <br/>
some of that still...mostly with just Cimion now but at one time it <br/>
was all three. <br/>
<br/>
My point is that it depends on how a child lives...the stuff itself <br/>
is not the problem. It&#39;s how it&#39;s given and why it&#39;s given. At least <br/>
that what I&#39;ve seen with my three. <br/>
<br/>
One of the things that really helped us, was something I did called <br/>
our &quot;Grateful Wall&quot;. I have an small, empty wall space near the <br/>
entrance to our family room. I covered it in card stock and <br/>
wrote, &quot;I AM GRATEFUL...&quot; in big letters along the top. I them <br/>
invited my family to write and add to it whenever they wanted. There <br/>
are about 65 entries on it and they&#39;re so good for the soul to read! <br/>
(Especially when they&#39;re about me! It just makes my day) :-)<br/>
<br/>
Oh by the way...we&#39;re quite frugal. We&#39;re five people and two pets <br/>
on one salary. It&#39;s more than just cutting back though-it&#39;s more of <br/>
a mindset for me. I like to save money and comparision shop and look <br/>
for creative ways to stretch our money. My kids actually think it&#39;s <br/>
smart and it has led to interesting conversations about money <br/>
management. <br/>

My point is that it depends on how a child lives...the stuff itself  <br/>
is not the problem. It&#39;s how it&#39;s given and why it&#39;s given. At least  <br/>
that what I&#39;ve seen with my three. *****************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes!  I agree.  Excellent point.<br/>
 <br/>
But many kids still like to get stuff.  I don&#39;t think it is an  either/or <br/>
type of thing.<br/>
 <br/>
I love your &quot;grateful wall&quot; idea!  Very nice.<br/>
 <br/>
********Oh by the way...we&#39;re quite frugal. We&#39;re five people and two  pets <br/>
on one salary. It&#39;s more than just cutting back though-it&#39;s more of  <br/>
a mindset for me. I like to save money and comparision shop and look  <br/>
for creative ways to stretch our money. My kids actually think it&#39;s  <br/>
smart and it has led to interesting conversations about money  <br/>
management. *************<br/>
 <br/>
I hope you didn&#39;t take my using frugal as a negative thing.  I meant  <br/>
frugality as a virtue.....there are those in my family that think themselves  <br/>
superior because they live this value and judge others that don&#39;t.  My  husband grew <br/>
up in Greece and experienced a culture based more on  abundance.  They throw <br/>
big parties and spend lavishly on their  friends.  There is no such thing as <br/>
&quot;splitting the check&quot; where he grew  up, that was an insult.  I realized after I <br/>
married him that although  there is lots of room for common sense frugality, <br/>
it didn&#39;t mean it was  &quot;right&quot; as a lifestyle above others.  I had just never <br/>
known another  way.<br/>
 <br/>
It has been good for me, because my knee-jerk reaction is often different  <br/>
from his.  It has given me a reason to examine my &quot;knee-jerks&quot; to see if  they <br/>
are based on truth and common sense or to my own conditioning.<br/>

<br/>
TV, though, still seems like an entirely different beast. My objection to<br/>
watching isn&#39;t that I necessarily think it isn&#39;t &quot;educational&quot;, if I may be<br/>
forgiven for using that word. I still tend to think that it is, in fact,<br/>
somewhat addictive (not like cocaine, but perhaps like marijuana...which<br/>
hasn&#39;t had any studies that unarguably demonstrate it is harmful either and<br/>
certainly it isn&#39;t incredibly addictive) so that it isn&#39;t quite a matter of<br/>
trusting my child to turn it off...I think that perhaps some kids might need<br/>
HELP in turning it off (once it is on in the first place).<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Then how do you explain that all our kids aren&#39;t &quot;addicted&quot; to TV? How do you explain that<br/>
our kids CAN turn it off even when it&#39;s on in the first place?<br/>
 <br/>
Trust.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And besides the addictive part, I really don&#39;t like that advertisers and TV<br/>
professionals are being allowed into my home freely to seek out my children<br/>
and get them to want things...things that they would not have wanted or<br/>
known about if they had never watched TV in the first place. Not just<br/>
things, either, but ways of talking and acting. Unfriendly, whiney ways of<br/>
acting and talking. Stereotypical ways of acting, like coming to assume that<br/>
little sisters are &quot;a pain and annoying&quot; because that is what is portrayed<br/>
on TV.<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
The advertising: I&#39;d rather my son make a bad $10 decision NOW than a bad $10,000 decision later. I&#39;d rather that he learn HOW advertising works NOW.<br/>
 <br/>
Talking and acting: I want my children&#39;s worlds BIGGER than what&#39;s at home. We talk about Ed, Edd, and Eddy and Angelica and Red and why they act the way they do---AND that they&#39;re ACTORS playing parts. Usually stereotypes. <br/>
 <br/>
Plus, children go through phases of trying on different personae. Both of mine have been dogs and superheroes for extended periods. Cameron imitated Bevis and Butthead for months (ugh!)---but it&#39;s a phase. Duncan does Family Guy&#39;s Peter occasionally. Hardly role models! &lt;g&gt; But they KNOW they&#39;re not! They&#39;re just playing. Good thing Tom Hanks&#39; and Sean Connery&#39;s moms didn&#39;t discourage THEM! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=- <br/>
<br/>
So do your kids never ask for things that they have seen on TV? And do you<br/>
really not see any behavior changes that you attribute to characters on TV<br/>
shows? I am asking because I see those things in my kids and the idea of<br/>
letting them watch unlimited TV is difficult for me to imagine. I truly feel<br/>
like I am letting them wander into a forest alone....or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Both. But neither lasts. They learn. They grow. And they were never all alone. I was always right there, talking about the chrarcter or the products. We&#39;re NOT hands-OFF; we&#39;re hands-ON!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508064501">I completely disagree with that idea in my experience. My son is only 3 and half and has more than 50 Thomas The Thank Engine &quot;engines/car sets&quot;. He loves every single one of them. We have at least 6 or 7 Thomas and he knows minimal diferrences between them.<br/>
He cherishes every single one he has. Of course he likes some more than others. Actually he is pretty much like that with all his toys, games, puzzles, books... and he has tons of it.<br/>

  I was just thinking about this earlier today, mostly because the <br/>
  girls have so much stuff right now that I just have trouble managing <br/>
  it. What I&#39;ve always heard is that the more you have, the less you <br/>
  care or appreciate any of it. For example, if you have twenty <br/>
  stuffed animals you might not even notice if you lose one, but if <br/>
  you have one or two, you will cherish them and they&#39;ll be very <br/>
  special to you.<br/>

why and work to solve the problem.<br/>
<br/>
When a parent is a roadblock in order to create a frugal environment  <br/>
and teach a lesson, it&#39;s a very different situation. The children  <br/>
know the parents are deliberately limiting them and their reactions  <br/>
to the roadblock is often argument, anger, sneaking, resentfulness  <br/>
and, well, basically nothing positive!<br/>
