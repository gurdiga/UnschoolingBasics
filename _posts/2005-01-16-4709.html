<div id="ygrps-yiv-157719832">I don&#39;t want to sound harsh, because you will get a lot of good <br/>
ideas here, but your dilmemna is not an unschooling one, it&#39;s a <br/>
school one.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We will not be able to afford our new<br/>
house. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would seriously never buy a house that would force me to work. I <br/>
love the peace I have in knowing that I could quit my job at any <br/>
time and we would be fine. It doesn&#39;t leave you much flexibility in <br/>
the homeschooling options department if you MUST work, unless you <br/>
can find different work that gives you some new options.<br/>
Is it too late?<br/>
Can you buy a different house?<br/>
Or stay put?<br/>
My child&#39;s peace, safety and love of learning are FAR more important <br/>
than having a bigger or better house. Only you know the answer to <br/>
this one though.<br/>
<br/>
My first thought was to let your child quit school and be with you <br/>
at work. Is there a lounge or area he could be for part of the day <br/>
and then maybe spend the other part with your dh?<br/>
Can you find different work? Or work from home?<br/>
Of course you CAN, what I mean is, would you be willing to look at <br/>
those options?:)<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to get your child free of the system, then it&#39;s <br/>
going to take a big shift in lifestyle it sounds like. There isn&#39;t <br/>
that much left of this school year, if you could just take him with <br/>
you to work, it&#39;s only a few more months.<br/>
If the house is the only thing standing between your child and <br/>
peace, I think it&#39;s time to re-think priorities. That&#39;s just me <br/>
though.<br/>
