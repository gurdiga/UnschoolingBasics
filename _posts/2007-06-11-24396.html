<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068100717">there are alot of online high schools. Just google it and you will come up with tons. It depends on what kind of education you are looking for. If the girl&#39;s mother just wants a diploma, there are many to fit the bill, like Brighham young university. Clonlara offers an &quot;alternative&quot; kind of diploma, that caters to those who want an alternative education. Keystone is another one. It all depends on your objectives.<br/>

I ADORE _www.globalvillage.org_ (http://www.globalvillage.org)   It&#39;s as <br/>
close to unschooling that I have seen yet. I&#39;ve had first hand  experience so feel <br/>
free to ask me anything about it. If I can help, I will. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-485217155">It&#39;s not on-line, but Goddard College offers a low-residency program  <br/>
for homeschooled teenagers. They can earn college credit for their  <br/>
work. I have a degree from Goddard, and it is about as fabulous as  <br/>
institutional learning can get: Students attend a residency at the  <br/>
beginning of each semester (it&#39;s a weekend for the teenagers, week- <br/>
long for undergrads and grad students) at which they plan their  <br/>
semester&#39;s course of study. The residencies when I attended were like  <br/>
intense conferences at which you got to see the work people was  <br/>
doing; students and faculty present their work, offer workshops, and  <br/>
so on. Students then return home and complete their work, sending  <br/>
packets every three weeks to their advisors for review and feedback.  <br/>
There are no grades; at the end of the semester, both the student and  <br/>
advisor write thoughtful narrative evaluations about the semester&#39;s  <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to de-rail. I have just always been keeping Goddard in  <br/>
mind as a resource my kids might want to explore when they get older,  <br/>
if they&#39;re interested in something and feel they might benefit from a  <br/>
structured program with the support of a mentor. For me, I felt like  <br/>
I improved about 10 years worth&#39; as a writer during my two years in  <br/>
the MFA program there.<br/>

So, Kelly, if your unschooled 14 year old came to you and expressed<br/>
interest in going to college, and felt that she wanted to try an<br/>
on-line high school, or that she wanted to try taking some community<br/>
college courses, does your comment mean that you would tell her<br/>
&quot;Honey, we are unschoolers.  We don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; school.&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
First off, I would try to determine *why* he wanted to take a high <br/>
school course. If he thought that was the best way for him to learn, I <br/>
would certainly try to offer other ways to get what he&#39;s looking for. <br/>
We know many people in many walks of life, including academia. There <br/>
*many* other options for &quot;high school level&quot; information.<br/>
<br/>
As for college courses, we did that. Cam (at 15 or 16, I guess) sat in <br/>
on a college sociology class at the University of South Carolina. He <br/>
got what he wanted from that---and realized that the college classroom <br/>
setting was *not* what he&#39;d expected.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling means &quot;child-directed learning&quot;, and, in my eyes, that<br/>
means letting the child discover his or her path in education.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but so many children (and almost all adults!) have been damaged by <br/>
school-thinking that it clouds their judgment regarding *how* to go <br/>
about learning. Too many people believe that learning must take place <br/>
in a classroom with top-down teaching. Opening our minds to the idea <br/>
that learning takes place *inside* the learner is a large step to <br/>
understanding unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I came to this board with this question because I am sure that even<br/>
unschoolers end up sometimes &quot;doing&quot; school.  I value an unschooler&#39;s<br/>
opinion on on-line programs over a regular homeschooler&#39;s opinion on<br/>
those types of programs because I feel that an unschooler would<br/>
probably direct me more towards programs that might possible by more<br/>
&quot;child directed&quot;, rather than &quot;traditional&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What about other options? Why is that not the question here?<br/>
<br/>
I mean: I understand that we would be a better choice, but coming to an <br/>
unschooling list and asking about better ways to do school is is not <br/>
the best use of the list.<br/>
<br/>
What is the child&#39;s goal? What are her passions? We can show you how to <br/>
reach THOSE goals withOUT the online school program.<br/>
<br/>
There is NOTHING you can learn in school that you can&#39;t learn OUT of <br/>
school. We have options! And lots of ideas!<br/>

 <br/>
Unfortunately Goddard didn&#39;t get enough enrollment for the program, so it  is <br/>
not currently running. I suspect if enough people asked for it and were ready <br/>
 to commit they&#39;d be delighted to try again. A parent or other adult needed <br/>
to  attend with the kid...I wonder if they would have had more success if <br/>
they&#39;d  invited the adult to also do a part-time for credit program. That&#39;d be very <br/>
 unschooling friendly, and kind of cool.<br/>

<br/>
The person posting the question, was not talking about an unschooler<br/>
wanting to try school. She was asking how to school an already<br/>
schooled child outside of a school building, that&#39;s all. We&#39;re not<br/>
here to help people school. What anyone chooses is their business, but<br/>
we&#39;re here to help people get OUT of school and schooling.<br/>
<br/>
If an unschooler comes here wanting advice on schools for a child,<br/>
we&#39;re not here to help with that. It doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t be a great<br/>
experience for that child, because they chose it. It just means that<br/>
we exist to help people  UNschool. We can discuss many things<br/>
surrounding the ideas of schooling and unschooled children choosing<br/>
school and other issues. But we&#39;re not here to help people school.<br/>
It&#39;s that simple.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518959933">I agree with you completely, especially after being a teacher in<br/>
public schools for the past ten years.  I&#39;ve gotten to the point where<br/>
I just can&#39;t do it any more, because I am sick and tired of being<br/>
forced to work with children in ways that I know is just not good for<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, however, in order to afford to leave my job and<br/>
unschool my own children, I do have to work as a tutor.  And I am<br/>
presently tutoring a girl who is suffering her way through public<br/>
school. The mom seems willing to consider homeschooling, but is very<br/>
doubtful of herself.  To top it off, the area where we live is a very<br/>
intense, high-pressure, college oriented area.   I am impressed that<br/>
the mom is even willing to take her child out of school, because most<br/>
parents of high schoolers in this area wouldn&#39;t consider it.  Parents<br/>
of younger children will, but the parents of kids in high school<br/>
definitely feel that there kids need to be &quot;schooled&quot;, since it is so<br/>
close to college.  Although I definitely plan on recommending Grace<br/>
Llewellyn&#39;s books to the mom, she also needs the reassurance of having<br/>
a place where her daughter can take &quot;classes&quot;.  I want to be able to<br/>
give her names of places that are a little unconventional - on-line<br/>
schools that do not work in the traditional manner, but which will<br/>
provide the mom with the comfort that she needs in order to feel that<br/>
her daughter is being &quot;educated&quot;.  <br/>
