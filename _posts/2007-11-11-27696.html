<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357605394">You are invited to join a new homeschooling forum. <br/>
Please feel free to browse and join the topics or conversations.  <br/>
This homeschooling forum is not location oriented. It is worldwide. We <br/>
are not putting up a boundary, we want people from around the globe to <br/>
participate and share their knowledge. This can be a great tool for <br/>
learning cultural differences as well as every day lifestyles from <br/>
county to country to continent.<br/>
We welcome everyone and hope you will share you thoughts and ideas.<br/>

**A special note:  I,personally, would love for the members of this <br/>
group to speak and add links to blogs, websites, book recommendations, <br/>
etc, as I love what you all stand for.</div>
