all of the other seasoned folk out there) but I still am working on <br/>
releasing myself from a lot of issues. <br/>
<br/>
One issue is in regards to not censoring what children want to watch on <br/>
tv...not so much as how it affects my kids but how it affects those <br/>
around them.  (I know...I shouldn&#39;t worry about what other people <br/>
think...that&#39;s a lot of my problem)<br/>
<br/>
example:  my two oldest (ds8 and dd6) wanted to watch Austen Powers <br/>
(first one) the other night.  My husband and I watched with <br/>
them...enjoying and laughing mostly but I was cringing during several <br/>
parts only because I knew the next day my son would be telling his <br/>
friend (homeschooled 8 year old previously schooled) what he saw (fem <br/>
bots, penis enlarger, etc...)  Will the parents of their friends want to <br/>
kill me for my kids exposing their kids to what those parents might <br/>
perceive as bad or dirty?  I shouldn&#39;t tell my kids not to talk to their <br/>
friends about what we have watched, or should I?  It&#39;s no different from <br/>
them being in school and hearing older kids talking about stuff, but <br/>
isn&#39;t that one of the reasons many have for keeping their kids at <br/>
home...to try and preserve their innocence; keep them naive for as long <br/>
as possible? (for the parent&#39;s benefit, I know ;-) ).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I worded this perfectly to get my question across but if <br/>
you have any advice I would gladly read it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your right. It&#39;s your issue...get over it &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have learned from their own experiences and other peoples comments <br/>
that everything they are comfortable with others may not be.  We&#39;ve <br/>
discussed this.  They have learned through social interaction that sometimes <br/>
other people will have judgements they don&#39;t agree with...tv shows, music, <br/>
food, heck even cheerleading....through their experiences they&#39;ve learned to <br/>
respect other peoples boundarys - recognizing that in some households people <br/>
have to ask parents for permission for certain things...the know which <br/>
parents to ask if its ok for their kids to listen or watch something or eat <br/>
something that my kids are going to do...they know which homes have more <br/>
controls over what areas.  Your kids will learn these &#39;social graces.&#39;  <br/>
Discussing it when they are confused and baffled by differences, brain <br/>
storming how to handle situations, recognizing their are different times for <br/>
different responses is part of learning social respectful conventions.  And <br/>
don&#39;t be afraid to share &#39;your issues&#39; with them...its fun to laugh at <br/>
yourself with your kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582084989">Simon really enjoys the word f*ck. It doesn&#39;t bother me, but I know it <br/>
bothers other people and he knows it bothers other people. So he doesn&#39;t say <br/>
it around his grandparents or around new people or around some of his <br/>
friends parents. And that is because we&#39;ve talked about it. I&#39;ve talked <br/>
about what words and ideas some people might find offensive. And why. It is <br/>
part of being the parent, helping your child to know what the social <br/>
niceties are and what the potential consequences might be, ie, upsetting <br/>
grandma, not being invited back to a friend&#39;s, having others think badly of <br/>
you. I can&#39;t keep him from swearing or talking about Family Guy in front of <br/>
others, nor would I want to act as his censor, but I can help him to know <br/>
who is less likely to appreciate the information. That said, penis enlarges <br/>
and fembots (with their machine gun jubblies) are pretty interesting topics <br/>
of conversation. I googled fembots just now and wikipedia has an entry on <br/>
Gynoid (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynoid)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynoid)</a>, the female form of android, <br/>
which includes fembots. I had forgotten the fembots in the Bionic Women, <br/>
apparently the first, with the robotic mechanism under their faces.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you should tell your children not to talk about Austen <br/>
Powers, but you could probably talk to them about what others might feel <br/>
uncomfortable with and why.<br/>
<br/>
As a side query, why are you sure your son would be talking about the penis <br/>
enlarger or the fembots? A lot of those things aren&#39;t the things that Simon <br/>
or Linnaea are paying attention to when they watch. Yesterday they were <br/>
watching Goldmember and were talking intently about how long they&#39;ve peed <br/>
and how asparagus can make your pee smell differently. They weren&#39;t talking <br/>
about the name Dixie Normous or any of the other sex jokes in Austen Powers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719731450">Amy, come on over to my house and your kids can watch Austin Powers (and even South Park &lt;gasp!&gt;) with my kids!<br/>
I probably at one time, worried about that kind of stuff. Now, what tends to run through my head is, &quot;You restrict your kids from XYZ? Hmmm... I may not be able to hang with you&quot;<br/>
It is really important to me that parents are open and willing to being well, open and willing. They don&#39;t have to be as far down the unschooling path as me, but if they are concerned about what I do rather than thinking that some of my parenting ideas are valid, then I just don&#39;t hang out with them. <br/>
I keep writing and erasing because I don&#39;t really know what to say to help with neighborly converstations or people questioning me.  I&#39;ve gotten to this place in which other people&#39;s opinions (non-unschooling/non-mindful parenting types) really don&#39;t make much of a difference to me.<br/>
