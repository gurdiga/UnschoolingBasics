<div id="ygrps-yiv-772006722">Kendrah, <br/>
   I so understand what you are saying!  My parents aren&#39;t that old<br/>
either ... 65 and 61 but I am seeing them begin to decline... my<br/>
father has heart issues and just newly diagnosed with diabetes (try to<br/>
explain to someone this age and set in his ways why he MUST change his<br/>
diet!UGH!)  my mother has fibromyalgia and is in fairly good health<br/>
but I do see her stamina and pain levels becoming more of an issue for<br/>
her in the past year.    <br/>
<br/>
   A few suggestions for you to help this stressful period feel a<br/>
little less stressful... while I know little children prefer mommy<br/>
perhaps while you are doing chores for grandmother have her read to<br/>
them or play simple games, even sitting and coloring or talking about<br/>
when she was a little girl could be a really great time of bonding for<br/>
them.  You could also enlist their help  and involve them somehow in<br/>
the house chores for grandmother... that often gives the little ones<br/>
such a boost of feeling big!   My 6 yr old loves nothing better than<br/>
to help grandpa with a chore or even just to carry something or<br/>
retrieve something for a grandparent that they can&#39;t do for<br/>
themselves.    My mother had foot surgery last summer and Jack was<br/>
thrilled to be the one in charge of putting her pillow under her foot<br/>
each time she moved from place to place.    While I was taking care of<br/>
my mother I also tried to remember how boring it could be for him to<br/>
be stuck inside for more of the day than he was used to and made sure<br/>
to stock grandmother with supplies so we could go outside for 30<br/>
minutes here and there.   I also tried to anticipate the types of<br/>
things that might need to be done there so I didn&#39;t find myself<br/>
running back and forth unnecessarily(my parents are 1 1/2 hrs away but<br/>
my brother lives next door and is helpful but does have to work all<br/>
day).    Anyway I think that this is one of those issues that may be a<br/>
little unique to our generation... our parents waited longer to have<br/>
children than our grandparents so we now have &quot;elderly&quot; parents in our<br/>
30-40&#39;s!   <br/>
<br/>
Anyway please don&#39;t miss an opportunity to give your kids some really<br/>
great memories of their grandparents and find ways to help your<br/>
parents feel useful by helping with the kids while you do things for<br/>
them.   <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

&gt; This past year my parents health has really went on a downhill slide,  <br/>

&gt; now more than ever. They are really trying not to be a &quot;burden&quot; on  <br/>
&gt; me, but since I don&#39;t have any siblings (I have a 38 year old brother  <br/>
&gt; that can&#39;t seem to take care of himself) that can help, the care is  <br/>
&gt; falling on me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have two kiddos (4 & 21 months), and my own house to keep up with  <br/>
&gt; taking care of. It seems most days I have just enough (if even)  <br/>
&gt; energy to keep up with my kiddos. Today my mom is at her house (a 40  <br/>
&gt; minute drive away, and my son isn&#39;t fond of longer car trips right  <br/>
&gt; now) waiting for me and the kids to come by. She&#39;ll have a list of  <br/>
&gt; things she&#39;ll need done (and bless her heart she really does try to  <br/>
&gt; keep the list to a minimum). While my own home needs tending to. Dh  <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t have dd go pee before bed last night and she went in her  <br/>
&gt; sleep. The mattress pad was bunched where she was lying so it totally  <br/>
&gt; missed the pad and stained the mattress. I have that to clean. I have  <br/>
&gt; at least 2 loads of cloth diapers that need watched, kids who will  <br/>
&gt; need fed soon, trash and recycling that needs to be gathered and  <br/>
&gt; taken out because pick up is tomorrow, (among other things that  <br/>
&gt; probably should be done today). As well as two kids that  <br/>
&gt; (understandably) want to play with mommy most the day.<br/>
&gt;   Yet, my mom who is sitting at home, confined to her bed, or chair,   <br/>
&gt; has chores for me to do. She has no other choice, she recently broke  <br/>
&gt; her ankle so bad she&#39;s needed three surgeries in one month. She is in  <br/>
&gt; pain. She can&#39;t walk at all. She probably won&#39;t be able to for at  <br/>
&gt; least 4 months according to her ortho. On top of that when she was  <br/>
&gt; being pre-oped for surgery they find some heart abnormality. My dad  <br/>
&gt; has his own share of heart & lung problems and is on oxygen full  <br/>
&gt; time. He also is working full time (though he shouldn&#39;t be) because  <br/>
&gt; they have very little retirement saved.<br/>
&gt; Last week after a particularly challenging day with kids. They were  <br/>
&gt; finally winding down and I was able to grab a couple minutes to  <br/>
&gt; myself for a cup of tea. The phone rings, I don&#39;t answer. The machine  <br/>
&gt; picks up. It is my mom is tears, saying how overwhelmed she is with  <br/>
&gt; everything and that she needs to talk. I don&#39;t pick up. I try to just  <br/>
&gt; take the time to have my tea, but its too late. Hard to enjoy my tea  <br/>
&gt; when I&#39;m concerned about her. And I call her right back. And for an  <br/>
&gt; hour try to offer reassurance. She is, as always, *extremely*  <br/>
&gt; grateful to me (that is what makes me want to help her, because I  <br/>
&gt; know how much she truly appreciates me).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, Phew so that is the story currently. I think the reality of  <br/>
&gt; what is happening doesn&#39;t match what I *thought* would happen. My  <br/>
&gt; parents are still fairly young. I didn&#39;t expect to have to play such  <br/>
&gt; an active role in taking care of them...yet. I knew it would happen  <br/>
&gt; but it caught me off guard, as life always does. If my kids were  <br/>
&gt; older it probably wouldn&#39;t be such a big deal, but they are still so  <br/>
&gt; young, and need me so much right now. I also know that their are  <br/>
&gt; people who have much more demanding situations. I know I should be  <br/>
&gt; thankful that at least my parents are around to take care of. And  <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t get me wrong, I love them very much and am so grateful to have  <br/>
&gt; them. Which makes me feel guilty for being a whiner, lol!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve complained enough.:) Off to get started on getting a little play  <br/>
&gt; time in with the kids before breakfast, and all the rest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation. Being a  <br/>
&gt; parent of young children, while also having to take care of your own  <br/>
&gt; parents? Any experiences to share? Any suggestions?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m really trying to think in abundance here. I keep telling myself I  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805974179">Some thoughts that come to mind:<br/>
<br/>
First, is there anything you are able to do to reduce your own work<br/>
load?  You mention washing cloth diapers -- can you, for the time<br/>
being, use a diaper service?  How about some prepared foods for those<br/>
crazy mealtimes?  Pre-chopped veggies are healthful and easy.  There<br/>
are other ways to streamline food prep to make that a bit less time<br/>
(and energy!) consuming.<br/>
<br/>
Do your parents have neighbors you could ask for light help from? <br/>
Friends in the area, that sort of thing.  Sometimes people want to<br/>
help, but don&#39;t know what they can do.<br/>
<br/>
If your 38 yr old brother is local, he CAN help -- but he may need<br/>
very specific direction.  Can you give him specific tasks, whether<br/>
grocery shopping or some other task, to lighten your load?<br/>
<br/>
Another wild option that just occurred to me, is for  a day or two,<br/>
perhaps you could spend the night there, so you don&#39;t have to spend 80<br/>
minutes driving each day...  Don&#39;t know the situation, so it may or<br/>
may not work, but if so, might be a bit less hectic.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck dealing with this right now.  As your mom heals, she will<br/>
be able to handle a bit more, so look for that light at the end of the<br/>
(very long) tunnel!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616942942">Call for help! They both need at least part time home health aides,<br/>
which should be covered by insurance (if they&#39;ve got insurance) or by<br/>
disability or other government programs (not that I&#39;m a big fan of<br/>
government programs but here&#39;s a case where they can be useful).<br/>
<br/>
FIL has been in the hospital, from a critical care unit to ICU to his<br/>
current stay in a minimal care area, since just after Thanksgiving.<br/>
Prior to that, he was home but needed pretty much full time care. MIL<br/>
works fulltime (BTW they&#39;re similar in age to your folks - FIL is about<br/>
to turn 63 and MIL is in her mid/late 50s) to keep the insurance<br/>
coverage and income - FIL had to retire early on disability late in 2006<br/>
because he couldn&#39;t stand or drive (he stood up at work and fell down<br/>
because he was dizzy). So, family were trying to care for him, taking<br/>
turns. But DH is the only one of the siblings (he has 3 sisters) who<br/>
isn&#39;t working fulltime. It was hard to get them to understand that just<br/>
because he didn&#39;t go out to a paying job all day, that he wasn&#39;t &quot;free&quot;<br/>
to spend all day in the IL&#39;s small senior housing apartment with DS (who<br/>
is 9 1/2 and really needs a lot of space to move and make noise and play<br/>
freely). It finally got so bad that a visiting nurse (who they FINALLY<br/>
got to come in, after DH and I were on them about it for several months)<br/>
who came in to check the dressings on FIL&#39;s sores (from sitting all the<br/>
time and having legs so swollen with fluid that they oozed) noticed that<br/>
his blood pressure was dangerously low and his temp was bordering on<br/>
hypothermia (in a comfortably heated apartment with a blanket on) and so<br/>
on. That was an ambulance ride to ER and he&#39;s been in the hospital ever<br/>
since (and grumping that he doesn&#39;t get enough visitors!) And he&#39;ll be<br/>
going to a convalescent/rehab facility from the hospital and he may need<br/>
more care than home provides so may end up in a care facility<br/>
permanently.<br/>
<br/>
The upside of all this is that the hospital has social services workers<br/>
and such who are working with the ILs to arrange post-hospital care with<br/>
them - it&#39;s not just us telling them they need to get home care and<br/>
such.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-755047792">Kendrah! Lots of hugs!!! You can do this.. I have been<br/>
caring for my 85 yr old mother for so long I can&#39;t<br/>
even remember a time I wasn&#39;t. She isn&#39;t bedridden,<br/>
she&#39;s almost completely blind and has heart trouble<br/>
(and other ailments). She ensconced herself on the top<br/>
of a hill 20 miles from town and we (dh and I) are<br/>
responsible for everything. My most practical advice<br/>
is to find a friend. I have a friend, we&#39;ve been<br/>
through everything together, and now we are dealing<br/>
with our elderly parents together. I call her, she<br/>
calls me, she understands when I am ready to rip my<br/>
hair out with frustration, I can see the humor in what<br/>
is going on with her situation although others would<br/>
be horrified if they heard us laughing. Being able to<br/>
get your frustration out and sharing with someone is<br/>
honestly the best thing you can do. You can try<br/>
enlisting your brother with very specific tasks but<br/>
don&#39;t count on him. I&#39;m not an only child, I&#39;m just<br/>
the only one that makes an effort. See if you can find<br/>
a rhythm to your parent&#39;s needs and try to meet them<br/>
before they ask. My mom needs to go shopping all the<br/>
time it seems, much more often than I shop for the<br/>
four of us. I head a lot of it off by buying in bulk<br/>
and bringing it unasked for. If you can get them to<br/>
eat frozen dinners buy lots of them on sale. Better<br/>
yet, Meals on Wheels!!! Mind you my mother won&#39;t do<br/>
either of these but they would make her (and my) life<br/>
so much easier. See where errands need to be run and<br/>
try to eliminate or lessen them. Buy 100 stamps, not<br/>
10. Get drugs in the mail. Make a list of things you<br/>
are doing, it will help you see what will need to be<br/>
done. Enlist friends to stop in and just visit. One of<br/>
the best things I have is a neighbor who has a<br/>
cappuccino machine. Two, three times a week she makes<br/>
one for my mother and brings it to her in the morning.<br/>
My mother thinks she is being neighborly... she<br/>
is...but she is also doing a visual check that my mom<br/>
is okay. I call her every night after dark to check<br/>
that she&#39;s okay. Call Senior Services, they may be of<br/>
help and can tell you what services are available in<br/>
their area. Commandeer a room in their house for the<br/>
kids and introduce some toys and activities that are<br/>
for there only. Going and spending the night may be<br/>
easier too. If nothing else you can get lots done<br/>
while the kids are asleep. Enlist your 4.5 yr old to<br/>
be Grandma&#39;s assistant, let her do some simple<br/>
&quot;helping Grandma&quot; chores, get Grandma some water, give<br/>
feel better neck rubs, empty the dryer, fold, set the<br/>
table, water plants, whatever she can do. It won&#39;t be<br/>
perfect but it will help everyone on many levels. It<br/>
is a learning process, someday you will be old hand at<br/>
this, you will still want to rip your hair out but you<br/>
will mostly feel more able. And then something new<br/>
will happen, that&#39;s life! Chin up--ELISA<br/>

Where were you two years ago when my MIL had a stroke?<br/>
Excellent advise!  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s been two years now that my MIL has been living with us<br/>
and I can honestly say it hasn&#39;t all been pleasant.  Most of<br/>
it not.  Lol, it even got so bad that once or twice I threatened<br/>
my spouse it was me or her!<br/>
 <br/>
Thank goodness, she listened when he told her somethings <br/>
needed to change in reference to her behavior if she didn&#39;t<br/>
want to be put in a home.  Since then she has been better<br/>
behaved and I can truly say after two years, there is finally<br/>
peace in our small house.<br/>
 <br/>

Finding a rhythm really helps.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732370579">One thing I didn&#39;t see mentioned yet is the necessity of asking your husband <br/>
for help *before* things get to the point you&#39;re crazed with the stress. :)   <br/>
For instance, leave the diaper loads for him to run in the evenings, ask him <br/>
to do the grocery shop in the evening or on the weekend, leave some of the <br/>
regular household stuff for him that you&#39;d usually do yourself. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a tendency to not ask our partners for help when it&#39;s *our* parents <br/>
causing the extra workload, to think *we* should handle it all because s/he&#39;s <br/>
already working so hard to support us all. To feel guilty because we can&#39;t do <br/>
it all. But you&#39;ll all be happier if the increased load is spread around a <br/>
little more, if he takes some of your regular stuff so you can spend that life <br/>
energy on your other obligations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835842719">Wow!  That makes me feel a little guilty, &lt;blush&gt; In dealing with my MIL<br/>
who has been living with us for two years now till the end of her or my life<br/>
I&#39;ve left the overall handling of the situation to my spouse, her son.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to work out better for him to play her care taker as he is the only<br/>
one to get through to her.  That doesn&#39;t mean the kids and I don&#39;t help but things<br/>
are ever so much more peaceful with him dealing with her overall care.<br/>
<br/>
I pray that all of you have a much easier MIL to deal with!<br/>
V<br/>
