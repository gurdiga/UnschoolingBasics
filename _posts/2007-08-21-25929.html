<div id="ygrps-yiv-576075285">there is another family with 2 kids who consider homeschooling.  they<br/>
come to my house alot. one child is 12 year old and the other one is 5<br/>
year old.<br/>
the older child had hard time in school, being taunted by teachers and<br/>
kids. he was streotyped as the ADHD one and was forcely medicated for<br/>
4 years. Thankfully the parents took him off medications. He is NOT<br/>
ADHD. he is a bright sensitive child.<br/>
<br/>
now I see he has no idea what he likes to do. He is playing on<br/>
computer games for all day. Or reads comic books all day.<br/>
The younger brother likes to see him playing the games, as well my son<br/>
likes to try to play too.<br/>
<br/>
So the kids end up by the compupter many hours. Otherwise they jump<br/>
around on the bed or play with the cat few minutes a time. They are<br/>
doing this already for 2 months in the summer vacation... and will not<br/>
go back to school. <br/>
<br/>
Is there anything I could do to help? I know its deschooling. What<br/>
shall I expect in the deschooling? Looks like long time - 2 months.<br/>
How long is it likely for a 6th grader to deschool? will he be on the<br/>
computer forever? I wish he will start to figure out what he likes to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972431175">My ten year old took 18 months...so I&#39;d add another half year or so  <br/>
for a 12 yo to finish deschooling.<br/>
Maybe being on the computer *is* unschooling for him. My son&#39;s  <br/>
primary means of learning is online, and it is a lot of learning ;-)<br/>
I&#39;d give him a lot of space to figure out who he is, offer LOTS of  <br/>
activities, and let go of the expectations. The five year old will  <br/>
probably do a lot better. Good luck!<br/>

How long  is it likely for a 6th grader to deschool?<br/>

_______________________________________________<br/>
 <br/>
Roughly 6 months, from what I understand - and of coure, that varies from  <br/>
person t person, but the approximation has been mentioned before...somewhere,  <br/>
lol...<br/>
 <br/>
Time. Opportunity, too. That&#39;s a big one. For now, the kids, the older one  <br/>
especially, needs to get to know himself before he can find what he loves. And  <br/>
when he DOES find what he loves, he may change that up again, lol! But with <br/>
the  opportunity idea, maybe suggest ideas that you&#39;ve seen on TV, anything <br/>
from  animal shows, to science, to the weather channel to the food network (Alton <br/>
 Brown!). Maybe bake with him. Let him knead some dough, choose a flavor of <br/>
ice  cream to make. Collect bugs :) There&#39;s lots to do, but it&#39;s hard to see it <br/>
when  the idea of doing &quot;nothing&quot; is there. Nothing isn&#39;t possible, we are <br/>
always  doing something. I know it&#39;s hard to see that at first...really hard. <br/>
Oh, and  music! Find bands he likes, maybe, songs he likes and look them up on <br/>
the  computer..oh, there is a lot. And I&#39;m SURE someone else will have some <br/>
excellent  ideas and some better ideas...I&#39;m quite new at this! But making the <br/>
opportunity,  without the demands of having him do it (he still needs to decide <br/>
for himself  and no one should be hurt if he doesn&#39;t like the idea, just time <br/>
for more  creative solutions). Oh, planting flowers, veggies, stuff like that <br/>
too...<br/>
 <br/>
It will all come together, in time. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps the computer IS what he likes to do right now.  Playing on the <br/>
computer is not just one thing.  My daughter is on her computer most <br/>
of the time when we are at home, but she does a lot of different <br/>
things - plays The Sims 2 and downloads a lot of stuff for the game, <br/>
reads fanfiction and occasionally writes stories to post there, plays <br/>
dress up/makeover games while listening to music, sends messages to <br/>
family & friends, reads some favorite blogs, reads articles at <br/>
LiveScience and oh, probably lots more stuff too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895001244">Deschooling can vary, depending on the kid.  Can be about a month per year of school, but since he&#39;s probably had a hard time in school from the get-go, maybe a lot more.<br/>
<br/>
I think he actually does have an idea about what he wants to do - it&#39;s reading comic books and playing on the computer!<br/>
<br/>
You say the kids whine to their mother that they are bored.  Do you see what the mom does when that happens at their home?  Is mom engaged with the kids?  She&#39;ll have to deschool, too, especially since her older son has been in school all this time.  I&#39;m guessing she&#39;s new to this concept of unschooling.  Send her to Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s sites; get her a copy of Live Free, Learn Free, or a subscription to Connections e-zine.  Those voices will help her initially; then you can invite her to this list &lt;g&gt;.  I&#39;ll post the links to the above (once I find them), if you want.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious why you say &quot;I wish he will start to figure out what he likes to do and not be bored easily when there is no computer&quot;?  Is &quot;no computer&quot; likely?  Is that going to determine if they homeschool/unschool?<br/>
<br/>
Are you worried about the influence of the currently-deschooling child?  It sounds like a lot of worrying going on here &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At *least* six months. Maybe longer, depending on personalities and  <br/>
family dynamics. Mom and dad have to deschool, too, and parents take <br/>
longer and tend to get in the way ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; now I see he has no idea what he likes to do. He is playing on<br/>
&gt; computer games for all day. Or reads comic books all day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a good example of how a parent&#39;s need to deschool can get in <br/>
the way. Sounds like the kid knows *exactly* what he likes to do! <br/>
*And* he has a strong ability to focus - something he may not have <br/>
had a chance to really exercise in school, which expects kids to <br/>
drop and change at fairly short intervals (and then people complain <br/>
about attention problems, go figure!). <br/>
<br/>
Are mom and dad offerring lots of fun things to do? If not, he could <br/>
be doing these things as more of a default. That&#39;s worth <br/>
considering. School really erodes kids&#39; ability to self-motivate, so <br/>
new unschoolers can sometimes need a lot of help figuring out what <br/>
they want to do. School also breaks down communication between kids <br/>
and adults, so its really important for deschooling parents to make <br/>
lots of overtures. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is there anything I could do to help? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes! Help mom come up with lots and lots of fun stuff for them to <br/>
do. If they have different interests, can you take one of them while <br/>
mom does something with the other? I have a similar age split <br/>
between Mo and Ray and sometimes trying to meet both their interests <br/>
at the same time can be a challenge. Especially since Ray has no <br/>
interest in going places like museums, or anything that seems <br/>
remotely &quot;educational&quot;. He&#39;s been out of school almost a year and <br/>
still has that baggage - but Mo has never been in school, so she&#39;s <br/>
happy to do some of the things Ray cringes at. Having friends <br/>
willing to take one of my kids somewhere - or just hang out at home <br/>
with one of them while I take the other out - is a real lifesaver. <br/>
<br/>
If mom is interested in unschooling, she might find it helpful to <br/>
browse various sites and boards for discussions of ideas <br/>
like &quot;autonomy&quot; and &quot;partnership&quot;. School and conventional parenting <br/>
tend to favor the idea of &quot;independence&quot; which tends to put a big <br/>
wedge between parents and kids. Part of deschooling for parents <br/>
involves learning how to have a different kind of relationship with <br/>
children. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590035880">This is a little difficult for me because my options are limited. I<br/>
don&#39;t have a car. When I will have my driving license I will figure<br/>
out how to get a car. <br/>
so there is no enough publich transportation. It means I can go out<br/>
just locally like to the stores or to the library depending on the<br/>
weather. I have to stroll along a baby in a stroller.<br/>
<br/>
which is limiting the &#39;fun&#39; stuff we can do.<br/>
we have lots of games, like battleships, traffic, puzzles etc etc. we<br/>
are going to order things little by little.<br/>
<br/>
I can sometimes do fun stuff like cooking, doing karate, exercise,<br/>
some art projects.. depending on the kids moods.<br/>
<br/>
The mother is very stressfull and feeling overwhelmed. She is working<br/>
as a massage therapist in her house on and off. I sense they have some<br/>
difficulties as well financial dificulties which gets both parents<br/>
working long hours. <br/>
The mother sometimes can go out with her kids or do some art projects<br/>
with them (if the kids are interested LOL)<br/>
<br/>
The mother claims the kids are &#39;breaking down&#39; her apt making mess.<br/>
her kids are seemingly bored and stressed.<br/>
When her kids ate over my house I noticed they had bad habits of not<br/>
picking after themselves, and letting food dropping all over. When I<br/>
ask them to clean after themselves they frown and resent it. They used<br/>
to bring snacks to the computer room, but thankfully they respect my<br/>
asking not to bring these snacks to the computer room dirting it down.<br/>
<br/>
what do you think? I am a little scared from this coming year.. help!<br/>
I feel like in a begining of a roller coaster wooohooo! hahaha!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347072090">I am usually a lurker here but this post really stuck out to me. My <br/>
name is Michelle and I am mom to Justin(11).<br/>
You could be describing my son. He has been out of PS since March of <br/>
this year. He had an awful time at school, especially the last year. <br/>
He was also labeled ADHD and all the other labels that come with it. <br/>
We have been deschooling for almost six months now. My son after <br/>
being home for a few weeks kind of felt like a fish out of water. He <br/>
really didn&#39;t know what to do with himself. For the past 6 years or <br/>
better he had someone else telling him what to do everyday, someone <br/>
telling him what was important and what wasn&#39;t. He honestly didn&#39;t <br/>
know how to think for himself. Just talking with him has helped alot. <br/>
He needed to know that we had a plan. It was a HUGE adjustment for <br/>
him. We talked ALOT! I explained the different avenues of <br/>
homeschooling and kept telling him that we would find what worked <br/>
best for him no matter what. And that for right now lets just hang <br/>
out..no stress..no worry. I almost think that he needed me to tell <br/>
him that it was ok to just do what you liked, do what makes you <br/>
happy. And yes at first what made him happy was the TV and computer. <br/>
He never had that freedom before. But I will tell you that the TV and <br/>
computer has led to so many other things. I can see everyday that he <br/>
is shedding his previously schooled skin. We didn&#39;t plan to unschool <br/>
in the beginning. Our living and having fun has just led us to that. <br/>
I guess I don&#39;t really have any &quot;advice&quot; for you but just wanted to <br/>
share what worked for us.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Having a home in active use 24/7 means a lot more wear and tear. <br/>
That&#39;s one of the &quot;downsides&quot; to any kind of homeschooling, much <br/>
less unschooling. Its *possible* to have a tidy home and unschool,  <br/>
but its generally more realistic for parents to make their peace <br/>
with a higher level of mess in addition to looking for ways to <br/>
streamline cleanup. <br/>
<br/>
Since mom is working out of her home, this is likely adding to her <br/>
stress about mess - her home is &quot;on display&quot; so she doesn&#39;t really <br/>
get a chance to say &quot;oh, its *just* a mess&quot;. Some brainstorming <br/>
needs to be done from that direction - how can the family reduce <br/>
mom&#39;s stress over clients having to wade through kid stuff?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ask them to clean after themselves they frown and resent it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its normal for kids who have been *made* to clean up (or anything <br/>
else for that matter) to be somewhat resentful when asked to do so, <br/>
even nicely. Maybe you can shift your own expectations to that of a <br/>
charming and gracious hostess - do you ask your adult friends to <br/>
clean up after themselves? <br/>
<br/>
If your guests are messy people, you can take precautions - <br/>
placemats, maybe even a sheet thrown down under the table for easier <br/>
cleanup. You can rearrange your cleaning habits somewhat so that you <br/>
wait to do some of your housekeeping until after the messy friends <br/>
leave. <br/>
<br/>
You could also plan to have snacks that are deliberately somewhat <br/>
messy - that way you are totally in the mindset that &quot;there&#39;s going <br/>
to be a mess&quot; and are comfortable with it beforehand and can pre-<br/>
plan cleaning solutions. Its also lots of fun - gooey things to eat <br/>
with fingers or lick off plates, foods that are also treasure <br/>
hunts.... great times. And to top it all off, it gives the kids the <br/>
message that their enjoyment is worth a bit of mess and <br/>
inconvenience to you. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The mother is very stressfull and feeling overwhelmed. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does mom *want* to unschool or does she feel like &quot;nothing else <br/>
worked so I guess we&#39;re unschooling?&quot; I&#39;ve heard that now and again -<br/>
 it seems like a really hard place to be, emotionally. I never had <br/>
to deal with that regarding unschooling per se, but my stepson <br/>
moving in didn&#39;t seem like much of a &quot;choice&quot; on our part, at the <br/>
time. It was really important for me and my partner to have some <br/>
very honest private conversations about frustration and resentment <br/>
so we could move through those feelings to something more positive.<br/>
<br/>
This is where thinking in terms of relationships (rather than goals, <br/>
manners or &quot;education&quot;) is one of the most powerful aspects of <br/>
unschooling. For the sake of their relationships, mom and dad need <br/>
to spend more time connecting with the kids. As a friend, you can <br/>
focus on your own relationship with the kids as well as looking for <br/>
ways to support mom and dad. When things are stressful at home, you <br/>
can be a safe, comfortable place for the kids to decompress a bit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033025071">Well, when I have guests over once or twice I say nothing if they<br/>
mess, but if the guests come to my house almost everyday they become<br/>
my house &#39;members&#39; and I ask them to share the keeping the house<br/>
liveable, hence picking up after themselves. I have an adult guest who<br/>
isn&#39;t a guest anymore she is my house member! and I asked her to help<br/>
us by picking after herself! <br/>
The kids are coming to my house alot they become the part of the<br/>
household include the upside of being welcomed with the &#39;downside&#39; of<br/>
being treated like household members.<br/>
<br/>
I am deaf and have hard time to understand so I can&#39;t talk with them<br/>
much. The boys are not that talktive. And the younger boy looks sad<br/>
and quiet. They don&#39;t have patience to repeat what they are saying so<br/>
I could understand them. I speak sign language and hope one day they<br/>
will be curious to learn! <br/>
<br/>
About the mess, I guess I will get a throw map on the table that I can<br/>
shake everything off after lunches. But it bothers me that the floor<br/>
gets food pieces all over. My kids don&#39;t drop foods on floor. <br/>
<br/>
When the kids go to sleep in my house they end up jumping all over<br/>
pillowfight especially at 12:00 am and slamming doors. I don&#39;t like<br/>
this and demand it to be stopped. My son once slammed the door, I was<br/>
upset and told him to sleep in our bedroom and not with these 2 boys.<br/>
my son got upset and cried a while and promised not to slam doors.<br/>
<br/>
Well coming for a sleepover once or twice its okay for me if they<br/>
sleep at 12:00 am + pillowfighting + jumping and howling, but anyone<br/>
living in my house I want a sane schedule, normal bedtime. <br/>
Making so much noise so late it keeps the baby awake and crying. <br/>
<br/>
Adult guests who choose to sleep late are considerate of others and<br/>
talk with hush voices. A far difference than going crazy like indian<br/>
warriors, hahahah!<br/>
<br/>
Pillow fight is okay with me but not THAT late. I can get them to the<br/>
bedroom at 8 pm so they can do all of the jumping and pillow fight<br/>
they like, so they can unwind and be asleep at 12:00 am. <br/>
No matter what - no door slamming is tolerated! <br/>
<br/>
I wonder why they need to do all of the pillow fights in the middle of<br/>
the night and not shift those loud activities to the daytime, they<br/>
could do all of the fights they want in my grassy backyard in a broad<br/>
sunlight and nobody will mind!<br/>
Is all of their stress from school need outlet most of all of the<br/>
times in the twilight of the midnight?<br/>
<br/>
I think its hilarious when their mother comes to pick these boys they<br/>
cry and beg not to go back home they love to stay in my house!</div>

*do* their parents want to unschool? That still isn&#39;t clear. Are <br/>
they using you as a childcare provider until one of them can be home <br/>

unschooling isn&#39;t about &quot;getting&quot; family members to do housekeeping <br/>

the &quot;downside&quot;. Here are a couple links on the subject of <br/>

If you are planning on unschooling your little one, you may want to <br/>
start thinking about these ideas now - its never too soon to start <br/>
deschooling yourself!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-559777736">~~No matter what - no door slamming is tolerated!~~<br/>
<br/>
I try to look at what my children are doing and why something is<br/>
happening, rather than saying &quot;not tolerated!&quot; If you lay down the<br/>
law, kids are much less likely to understand they reasoning behind<br/>
something or work with you to come up with an agreeable solution.<br/>
<br/>
If waking the baby is the problem, then that is what needs to be<br/>
addressed. Is the door slamming happening just because they are<br/>
excited and energetic? Is it happening because someone is upset? Can<br/>
the door be left open or taken off the frame all together?<br/>
<br/>
I think all people in my home have a say in how it is kept and what<br/>
unfolds here.<br/>

<br/>
now I see he has no idea what he likes to do. He is playing on<br/>
computer games for all day. Or reads comic books all day.<br/>
The younger brother likes to see him playing the games, as well my son<br/>
likes to try to play too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He DOES have a very clear idea of what he likes to do!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So the kids end up by the compupter many hours. Otherwise they jump<br/>
around on the bed or play with the cat few minutes a time. They are<br/>
doing this already for 2 months in the summer vacation... and will not<br/>
go back to school.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cool!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything I could do to help? I know its deschooling. What<br/>
shall I expect in the deschooling? Looks like long time - 2 months.<br/>
How long is it likely for a 6th grader to deschool? will he be on the<br/>
computer forever? I wish he will start to figure out what he likes to<br/>
do and not be bored easily when there is no computer.<br/>
(when he is home with his brother they get bored and whine to their<br/>
mother I am bored I am bored nonstop)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Two months ain&#39;t NOTHING!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing it&#39;ll be closer to 12-18 months.<br/>
<br/>
What does she have for them to do? Do they go out? Plan/cook meals? <br/>
Make Christmas cards? Take black & white photos of them?<br/>
<br/>
If she talks with them in advance and they plan to do 3-5 outings each <br/>
week, they&#39;ll have something to do each day.<br/>
<br/>
Why doesn&#39;t she have things for them to do? When we first started <br/>
(Cameron was 13 and just out of 6th grade), we&#39;d go to the beach on <br/>
Monday, the zoo on Tuesday, have Pajama & Pizza-Movies-all-day on <br/>
Wednesday, walk the Congaree National Swamp on Thursday, make sushi on <br/>
Friday.<br/>
<br/>
Find cool things to DO. Be interested & interesting.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or hurt kids!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its better to deal with issues like this separately, rather than <br/>
lumping them all together - when you group a bunch of issues like <br/>
this, even when they all tie together in a logical way in *your* <br/>
mind, kids are waaaaaaaaaay more likely to tune you out and not <br/>
listen to *any* of your reasons. They don&#39;t *see* damaged doors and <br/>
hurt kids *right now* - so its easy to disregard your concerns. Here <br/>
are some ideas for talking and thinking about the various issues <br/>
around the doors in your home: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; door slamming can damage the doors and frames<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Having kids around does cause more wear-and-tear on the home, as I <br/>
said before. The more energetic the kid(s) the more wear and tear. <br/>
Past a certain point, you *can&#39;t* stop that, short of tying the kids <br/>
up or kicking them out of the house. Active kids use bigger, more <br/>
forceful motions. If you aren&#39;t used to active kids, its kind of <br/>
startling how much Oomph they can put into the littlest gesture. My <br/>
stepson used to be infamous for hugs that could knock people down ;)<br/>
<br/>
Where I live, pretty much everyone slams doors in the summer - darn <br/>
things don&#39;t close otherwise, with all the humidity. If you have <br/>
particularly dainty doors, it would be a good idea to remove or <br/>
replace them, or at least the glass, but by-and-large, doors can <br/>
take a Lot of slamming. Heck, I&#39;ve kicked a couple doors open in my <br/>
time and even that doesn&#39;t harm them as much as you&#39;d think. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be dangerous in case<br/>
&gt; the baby is there with the hand in the wrong place in the wrong<br/>
&gt; time... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t talk about this with the kids in terms of the door, but <br/>
rather in terms of the baby. Chances are, they aren&#39;t interested in <br/>
actually hurting anyone, they just need a reminder when they&#39;re on <br/>
the run to watch out for the littlest. They may also need many <br/>
reminders when baby is sleeping - they don&#39;t have a baby at home, so <br/>
they aren&#39;t used to thinking about one all the time. <br/>
<br/>
It may also be necessary to plan for them to be around when the baby <br/>
is awake. I don&#39;t know what kind of arrangement you have, but if you <br/>
were thinking &quot;oh, I have time for these guys when baby&#39;s asleep&quot; <br/>
you might want to reconsider. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the 9 year old kid was running and didn&#39;t stop<br/>
&gt; himself on the time, by mistake he bumped into the closed glass <br/>
 </span></blockquote>door<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; breaking into the glass causing the shattered glass stabbing him in<br/>
&gt; the neck. the child died within minutes from blood loss. I have a<br/>
&gt; glass door in my house.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes kids *do* run smack-dab into things from time to time. Including <br/>
windows, lamps and tv sets (and people). You can spend a lot of time <br/>
and energy saying &quot;no&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;slow down&quot; or you can kid-<br/>
proof the house a bit more. Different ages take different kinds of <br/>
kid-proofing. Babies may need outlets covered, toddlers may need <br/>
bookcases screwed to the walls, older kids may need to have some <br/>
obstacles removed so they aren&#39;t always running into things. <br/>
<br/>
This sort of shift in thinking about kid-proofing is something that <br/>
happens normally as your child ages, but it isn&#39;t intuitive when all <br/>
of a sudden you have older kids in your home. Its a sort of culture <br/>
shock.<br/>
<br/>
Is it an interior door or an exterior door? If the door is inside <br/>
the house, consider removing it entirely for awhile, or just leave <br/>
it open. If its a door to outside, you can ask them to play their <br/>
chase-games outside *or* inside, if you need to shut out the <br/>
weather, and discuss it with them in terms of the weather. Its too <br/>
hot/cold/wet to leave the door open, sorry guys. If the weather <br/>
*isn&#39;t* an issue, leave the door open and put up a gate for baby.  <br/>
<br/>
Having a baby, it may be that 5, and especially 12 (thats their <br/>
ages, right?), seem really big and old by comparison. Its important <br/>
to keep in mind just how &quot;young&quot; 5 and 12 are. My stepson will be 14 <br/>
in a month, and is nearly six feet tall! and I periodically need to <br/>
remind myself how young 14 really is. Particularly when he&#39;s <br/>
bouncing around with an abundance of &quot;boyish enthusiasm!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re offerring them a whole lot of opportunities to <br/>
express their &quot;boyish enthusiasm&quot; - wonderful! Hopefully some of <br/>
these suggestions will help you find ways to continue to do that <br/>
with a little less stress on your part, so you don&#39;t end up burning <br/>
out. You sound like such a caring resource for this other family.<br/>
