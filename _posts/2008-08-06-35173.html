<div id="ygrps-yiv-950527096">Hi Alison.<br/>
<br/>
My son and I just spent three months in Auckland. There are two NZ Yahoo! Groups that <br/>
we joined just before we went. One was NZ Unschoolers and the other was a regular <br/>
homeschooling group--I can&#39;t remember the name though. I&#39;d recommend getting on <br/>
those groups before you go so you can set up some meetings. We ended up meeting so <br/>
many families that way. It was the highlight of our trip. <br/>
<br/>
Also, Shell, who is on this list, is in Auckland. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be happy to hook you up, <br/>
meet with you, etc. Visit her blog at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschoolersanonymous.blogspot.com/.">http://unschoolersanonymous.blogspot.com/.</a> She&#39;s a <br/>
great source of information and a lovely person to be around.<br/>
<br/>
If you want recommendations on places to go around Auckland I&#39;d love to share some of <br/>
our favorite spots with you. Just send me an e-mail directly if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you have a great trip!<br/>
<br/>
Colleen<br/>
