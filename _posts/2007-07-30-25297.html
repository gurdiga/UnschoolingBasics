<div id="ygrps-yiv-310361600">I really appreciate your willingness to help me. But please allow me to<br/>
share something<br/>
with you real quick. To me, your choice of words here is argumentative and<br/>
provocative.<br/>
When I just read it to reply - mind you I already read it once earlier today<br/>
- I could feel<br/>
something like my heart rate increasing, or my &quot;blood pressure rising&quot; as<br/>
they say. It&#39;s the<br/>
same feeling I feel when I&#39;m angry, so I guess I could say I feel really<br/>
angry at your choice<br/>
of words. Like I said, I sincerely appreciate your desire to advise, but I<br/>
just don&#39;t see the<br/>
tone here as helpful. Combines with another person&#39;s reply, it very nearly<br/>
had me want to<br/>
say &quot;forget it.&quot; And I would not be saying &quot;forget it&quot; to a journey<br/>
exploring what&#39;s best for<br/>
my kids, but rather &quot;forget it&quot; to seeking information here. I hope you will<br/>
take that<br/>
feedback in the spirit in which it was meant, and not make it about me being<br/>
resistant to<br/>
what you&#39;re saying. On the contrary, I am open to the concepts, but the<br/>
delivery could get<br/>
in the way.<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I want to speak to this, as it is something that *I* have felt and dealt<br/>
with, I assume the most of us have.<br/>
In my experience, this increased blood pressure at something someone else<br/>
has written, is the first step to an epiphany in my parenting concepts.<br/>
First thing, I will re-read the words using a different voice -- the gentle<br/>
sweet auntie voice is my favorite -- to see if it is MY interpretation of<br/>
the &quot;tone&quot; or the words themselves. Most often, the reaction in me is my own<br/>
chorus of voices responding to the words. I have found it difficult at times<br/>
to express my ideas with the &quot;tone&quot; I would use if I were speaking<br/>
face-to-face; I have to let the words do their job and hope that my words<br/>
will not be read with the voice of the cranky old schoolteacher or<br/>
judgmental stranger.<br/>
When ideas turn into a *hot button* with my emotions, I know this is a place<br/>
in great need of deep contemplation, followed by a spark in my actions -- so<br/>
that my thoughts AND actions are in line with my goal of honoring my family<br/>
and our unschooling lifestyle.<br/>
Breathing, revisiting, breathing, exploring, breathing, accepting,<br/>
breathing, breathing...<br/>
that&#39;s the pattern I follow :)<br/>
It also helps to remember the words, though sparked by your words/situation,<br/>
are out here for the whole of the community and are generally not meant for<br/>
you alone, but for anyone in the same place of stuckness.<br/>
