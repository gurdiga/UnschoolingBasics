<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278673939">I am bringing this post to the list under my name, though none of this<br/>
is my writing. It&#39;s a message I rejected, in order to allow the member<br/>
that posted them, a chance to read the strong responses it&#39;s sure to<br/>
evoke, without feeling attacked personally.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot to say about this, but I&#39;m posting it first for everyone<br/>
else to read:<br/>
<br/>
Posted by anon member:<br/>
<br/>
I know that there are probably people who disagree with me, but I<br/>
can speak from my experience.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being a child who had no limitations at all. I crossed<br/>
every line I could think of to get my parents to notice me and to<br/>
protect me from myself. I was pregnant at 17 and scared to death.<br/>
That didn&#39;t work either. After trying miserably for YEARS to get<br/>
somone to tell me how to get through life, at 23 I started to figure<br/>
some things out and really I am so far behind the curve. No<br/>
education, no chance of employment for more than minimum wage. I<br/>
never had to do anything. And I never learned to do it until I was<br/>
grown and really struggle a lot to learn it.<br/>
<br/>
For me, the times I am happiest is when I excercise self-discipline.<br/>
It took me forever to learn any form of it and I have no follow<br/>
through most of the time. I have bounced from one thing to another,<br/>
as soon as it is too challenging, or goes to slow, I move on. Except<br/>
with my children whom I do follow through with.<br/>
<br/>
There are children who do VERY well with no pressure. There are also<br/>
some who NEED and WANT structure. It&#39;s not torture to make a child<br/>
go to bed at a certain time. It&#39;s not torture to limit what they<br/>
eat. It does not mean that you are less of a mother because you<br/>
provide a structured enviornment. Maybe people who believe otherwise<br/>
will say that it isn&#39;t &quot;unschooling&quot; in its purest form, but who<br/>
really cares what other people think or if you fit into their box.<br/>
<br/>
You have to define what works for each child and ultimatley for your<br/>
family. I demand respect from my children because I deserve respect<br/>
from them. I see other parents who dont&#39; demand respect from their<br/>
children and their children, scream, bite, kick, pull hair, all at<br/>
their mother. Again, not all children react this way and some learn<br/>
respect different ways. YOu know your child.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t spank, but I really do mean what I say.<br/>
My children would not treat me with disdain or get away with<br/>
behaviour like that.<br/>
<br/>
I am also a human being and deserving of happiness also. And that<br/>
means we all have to learn to respect one another and follow rules<br/>
that make life manageble to everyone in the house.<br/>
<br/>
I do my best to give them space, watch them learn, hear what they<br/>
have to say, and do what we believe is best for them.<br/>
<br/>
If you think what you are doing now is working and is in the best<br/>
interest of your family, then I would absolutely support you.<br/>
<br/>
I am just suggesting that if its not working maybe trying something<br/>
new would bring about different results. Maybe he is acting out to<br/>
see if you care enough or are strong enough to stand up to him. To<br/>
me he sounds angry.<br/>
<br/>
Your son doesn&#39;t know what to expect. Sometimes he misbehaves and<br/>
you say nothing or just remind him. Sometimes he gets yelled at. It<br/>
all depends on how short your wire is that day. Sounds like the<br/>
consequesnes for his misbehaviour are that he gets yelled at and<br/>
threatened. So he is getting consequences. Why not try setting<br/>
consequences BEFORE you loose your cool. He gets them anyway. And<br/>
change the consequences. Maybe try making him clean up his own mess.<br/>
You know your child and what will get through to him. It might take<br/>
a while, but consistency works.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful that chaos isn&#39;t equated with freedom. The two can be<br/>
very different and bring about very different results.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh boy.  It sounds like while you feel you had no limitations, you<br/>
also were lacking in mindful parenting.  This is the only portion of<br/>
your post that I saved because I think that this is something that you<br/>
really need to consider in comparing your childhood to that of an<br/>
unschooled childhood.  My children have very few limitations.  I say<br/>
very few because I do ask them to tell me where they are going and<br/>
when they will be back and to carry their cell phone with them and<br/>
that I know who they are with - these are all things a mindful parent<br/>
does.<br/>
<br/>
We repeat this mantra often on this list &quot;Unschooling is not<br/>
unparenting.&quot;  Children who do not have forced bedtimes, controlled<br/>
food, have the freedom to pursue their passions *and* have *mindful<br/>
participating* parents will find their self-control.  On their own<br/>
with you there to help them if they are stumbling.<br/>
<br/>
An example:  My son Keon (8yo) has a difficult time distinguishing<br/>
things such as being tired, confused, overworked, etc.  He will work<br/>
on a video game for 12+ hours some days and just get into fits because<br/>
he can&#39;t beat this &quot;boss&quot; or is stuck trying to figure out where some<br/>
key is.  He will get angry to the point where he throws things or<br/>
yells or cries.  At first this behaviour upset me, but then I realized<br/>
this was how he worked things out but at the same time he *needed*  ME<br/>
to help him realize that he needs to take breaks and come back more<br/>
refreshed.  I got this message loud and clear when I started sitting<br/>
in the same room watching him play the games.  Watching his life.<br/>
Being aware of his needs.  I help he by suggesting things like, &quot;Wow,<br/>
this is really difficult.  It&#39;s making me dizzy.  I was thinking of<br/>
going and getting a cup of ice cream and sitting on the front step.<br/>
Care to join me?&quot;  or &quot;You seem very frustrated with this boss.  He<br/>
must be a really tough cookie.  Why don&#39;t we go take a walk around in<br/>
the garden and talk about what is so tough about this boss?  I bet<br/>
when you come in you can get past him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Part of self discipline is learning about what your body needs and<br/>
meeting those needs.  It&#39;s not about picking up your room, eating all<br/>
your veggies, doing a task list of chores, toeing the line, or having<br/>
to say yes ma&#39;am and no sir.  And children will learn to respect other<br/>
people (not just their parents) when they are met with respect and<br/>
have parents who are interested in their lives.  Were your parents<br/>
interested in your life?  It sounds like not if you went to such<br/>
extremes as getting pregnant at a young age.  I&quot;m sure there were<br/>
other incidents in your life where you were screaming LOOK AT ME<br/>
through your actions but not getting the *respect* that you were<br/>
needing.  The attention you deserved.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there will be others who have been living joyful unschooled<br/>
lives longer than I have who will chime in.  Your children will not<br/>
turn out like you if you don&#39;t act like your parents.  BTW, Keon today<br/>
was battling Hades (Lord of the  Dead, thank you very much) and having<br/>
a fit.  I was reading a book in another room and he came to me and<br/>
sighed.  I asked, &quot;Tough day?&quot;  He said, &quot;Hades is really making me<br/>
angry, so I thought I would take a break and see if that would help.&quot;<br/>
Now his break was only the time it took him to walk down the hall,<br/>
sigh at me and walk back.  Maybe that was all he needed right now, but<br/>
he is starting to recognize those things and act on them.  I don&#39;t<br/>
want to think what he would be like if I didn&#39;t take the time to be<br/>
mindful of his needs, wants and dreams.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-184320208">get my parents to notice me <br/>
*************<br/>
To me this was the key portion of this post.<br/>
VASTLY different than mindful parenting. Huge, wide, oceans apart.<br/>
Being ignored is not what we are doing or advocating here. It is the opposite. <br/>
AWARENESS is crucial.<br/>
As the poster went on to write the ideas supporting bedtimes, food restrictions et al, due to having a &quot;no limitations&quot; childhood, this phrase kept popping up in my head and coloring everything that was said.<br/>
Ignoring is not radical unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What you experienced was neglect.<br/>
<br/>
What people here will help others with is being with our children.  <br/>
Being their partners in life. Walking along next to them as they  <br/>
freely explore. We&#39;re there always as a resource: to ask advice of  <br/>
and to jump in when they&#39;re about to step off a cliff they don&#39;t  <br/>
realize is there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; After trying miserably for YEARS to get<br/>
&gt; somone to tell me how to get through life<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>An unschooling child doesn&#39;t need to try to get her parents to tell  <br/>
her. The help is always there. Unschooling and mindful parenting  <br/>
means being with your children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I started to figure<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s very easy to look at those who are ahead and feel they have an  <br/>
advantage that we wish we already have. And then to resent that we  <br/>
weren&#39;t given that advantage.<br/>
<br/>
Holding onto those feelings leads to unhappiness and frustration.<br/>
<br/>
No one has every advantage. Yes, some people *will* need to work  <br/>
harder to get where they want to go in life. Some people barely had  <br/>
to work to get As. Some people worked hard to get Cs. Life isn&#39;t  <br/>
fair. But dwelling on the unfairness doesn&#39;t make it fair. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>
move us closer to our goal. All it does is add a layer of sadness to  <br/>
not being where we would like to be.<br/>
<br/>
It helps lots to look at what you have, than to look at what you  <br/>
don&#39;t have. People arrive in America with little money without being  <br/>
able to speak the language and they make successes of themselves not  <br/>
by wishing they had what they don&#39;t but by setting their sites on  <br/>
what they want and going after it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s easy. The path of regret and despair is easy but  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t lead to happiness. The path of putting the past behind and  <br/>
looking forward is *hard*, sometimes *very* hard, but it does lead to  <br/>
happiness. As long as you are clear on what you want and why you want  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For me, the times I am happiest is when I excercise self-discipline.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It will help to see how that connects to your childhood, though,  <br/>
rather than being universally true for everyone. You perhaps equate  <br/>
limits -- self imposed or parent imposed -- with loving attention.  <br/>
Unschoolers offer loving attention in other ways: Real attention:  <br/>
listening, being aware, doing things with their child, doing things  <br/>
that will bring a smile to a child&#39;s face.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It took me forever to learn any form of it and I have no follow<br/>
&gt; through most of the time.<br/>
&gt; I have bounced from one thing to another,<br/>
&gt; as soon as it is too challenging, or goes to slow, I move on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There may be some depression involved. There is certainly some damage  <br/>
from your childhood that you&#39;re holding onto. Most of us *do* have  <br/>
baggage from childhood, lots of it from school :-/ And it&#39;s amazing  <br/>
the amount of time it takes to root it out. Mostly because we don&#39;t  <br/>
even realize we have these messages in our heads that we assume are  <br/>
true that turn out to not be true.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are children who do VERY well with no pressure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some people need *encouragement* to get through difficult parts of  <br/>
something they want to do. The encouragement that will work best will  <br/>
be different for each person. It totally depends on personality.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s something we can learn from our children: how much and what  <br/>
form of encouragement to give them.<br/>
<br/>
I think, though, that if we assume a child needs pushed, that they  <br/>
won&#39;t build up the confidence that  they can push themselves. But it  <br/>
can be just as bad to completely step away and not offer anything, to  <br/>
let the child go it alone. No one advocates that. People on the list  <br/>
advocate listening to children and helping them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are also<br/>
&gt; some who NEED and WANT structure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are children who feel comfortable knowing what the day holds.  <br/>
They don&#39;t deal well with changes in plan. That doesn&#39;t mean they  <br/>
want someone else to structure their life for them and make them  <br/>
stick to it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a difference between (externally imposed or enforced)  <br/>
structure and routine. There&#39;s a difference between (externally  <br/>
imposed or enforced) structure and creating a plan to accomplish a  <br/>
large task.<br/>
<br/>
Neither routines or plans require a parent to structure a child&#39;s  <br/>
day. We advocate helping them: help them figure out what they want,  <br/>
help them figure out a way to get it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s not torture to make a childgo to bed at a certain time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It can be for the child. The archives of Yahoo groups are a lot  <br/>
easier to search now and you can pull up sad stories adults tell of  <br/>
being made to go to bed when they weren&#39;t sleepy.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, helping a child learn to listen to their bodies,  <br/>
can help them go to bed when they&#39;re tired.<br/>
<br/>
No one advocates removing bedtimes and letting little kids put  <br/>
themselves to bed. People here will help others find ways to help  <br/>
their kids transition to sleep, though, without imposing a specific,  <br/>
by the clock time when kids need to be in bed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s not torture to limit what they eat.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, it can be for the child. There are even more horror stories of  <br/>
adults who had parents who controlled what they eat.<br/>
<br/>
If you went out for a meal with a friend who was on an unusual diet,  <br/>
would you want her to impose limits on what you could order? Many  <br/>
people will say a friend is not a parent who is trying to help the  <br/>
child make better choices. And yet the feelings are the same  <br/>
*regardless* of the relationship. A child doesn&#39;t automatically like  <br/>
having choices  taken away from them just because it&#39;s being done by  <br/>
a parent. There are other ways. People can help with ideas if there&#39;s  <br/>
a specific problem.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It does not mean that you are less of a mother because you<br/>
&gt; provide a structured enviornment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t help to grade people with grades as they do in school. And  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t help to grade people -- less than, more than -- on how  <br/>
well they parent.<br/>
<br/>
But some *ideas* will help people unschool. Some *ideas* will make it  <br/>
harder to unschool. Some *ideas* will help someone move towards a  <br/>
goal and some will make it more difficult.<br/>
<br/>
If people personally identify with the choices they&#39;ve made, it makes  <br/>
it lots harder to let go of ideas and look at the benefits (and  <br/>
drawbacks) of new ideas because they don&#39;t want to risk feeling bad  <br/>
or wrong.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t that conventional parenting doesn&#39;t &quot;work&quot;. It&#39;s that the  <br/>
goals are different than mindful parenting. The goals of conventional  <br/>
parenting are to mold a child into what the parent believes is the  <br/>
right way to be. Most people we know have been parenting  <br/>
conventionally some have turned out lousy, some have turned out  <br/>
great, most have some damage but they&#39;ve found ways to overcome or  <br/>
cope. Conventional parenting &quot;works&quot; to some extent.<br/>
<br/>
But there are side effects and compromises to conventional parenting  <br/>
that must be compensated for. Conventional parenting is, at its  <br/>
heart, an adversarial relationship. It&#39;s about changing our children  <br/>
in certain ways to be how we want them to be. So much of conventional  <br/>
parenting whittles away at our relationship with our children. To  <br/>
counteract that, parents need to do even more to rebuild the  <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
The primary focus of mindful parenting is the relationship we have  <br/>
with our child. Mindful parenting is about helping a child, being  <br/>
their partner, trusting that children want to be kind and helping  <br/>
them do that. It isn&#39;t ignoring a child&#39;s mistakes. It&#39;s about  <br/>
helping them figure out better ways to get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe people who believe otherwise<br/>
&gt; will say that it isn&#39;t &quot;unschooling&quot; in its purest form, but who<br/>
&gt; really cares what other people think or if you fit into their box.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one should be judging the worth of people here. But we do discuss  <br/>
the worth of ideas on how well they will help someone unschool and  <br/>
how much they will hinder.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parenting makes unschooling more difficult. When we tell  <br/>
children through our actions that we trust them to learn math but  <br/>
don&#39;t trust that they want to be kind, don&#39;t trust that they want to  <br/>
be safe, don&#39;t trust that they have the abilities to learn how to  <br/>
listen to their bodies, we&#39;re sending a double and confusion message.<br/>
<br/>
So it doesn&#39;t make any difference what people here think of a person.  <br/>
What *does* matter is what our children think of us. It helps to see  <br/>
what we do and how we treat them as a potential memory that a child  <br/>
will take with them into adult hood -- we can&#39;t control what they&#39;ll  <br/>
remember! -- and to question ourselves if this is what we want to be  <br/>
remembered for. It helps to see whether a choice we&#39;re about to make  <br/>
will help them feel like we&#39;re someone they can bring problems to or  <br/>
whether they feel like we&#39;re people who won&#39;t want to hear when  <br/>
they&#39;ve done something wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If my first reaction to a choice my daughter has made is disapproval,  <br/>
then she won&#39;t trust me not to disapprove of her. The more  <br/>
*confidence* she has that I&#39;ll disapprove, the more likely she&#39;ll  <br/>
seek out someone -- a friend who has as little experience as she? an  <br/>
adult who wants to exploit her? -- who will offer sympathy and help.<br/>
<br/>
I want her confidence that I will offer her sympathy and help. And if  <br/>
she&#39;s coming to me, she already knows the choice wasn&#39;t the best! So  <br/>
she doesn&#39;t need my disapproval. She needs my help.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You have to define what works for each child and ultimatley for your<br/>
&gt; family.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re coming from a childhood where you lacked loving attention  <br/>
and you&#39;re trying to use limits in order to give what you missed to  <br/>
your children, you may be giving them what you needed, rather than  <br/>
seeing them for their own unique selves.<br/>
<br/>
Too often when parents say they are doing what works for their  <br/>
family, what they really mean is what works for the parents.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I demand respect from my children because I deserve respect<br/>
&gt; from them. I see other parents who dont&#39; demand respect from their<br/>
&gt; children and their children, scream, bite, kick, pull hair, all at<br/>
&gt; their mother.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t demand respect from my daughter and yet she&#39;s respectful.<br/>
<br/>
I *do* let her know when she&#39;s hurting me. I *do* let her know when  <br/>
she&#39;s done something that may have hurt another. And I treat her with  <br/>
respect.<br/>
<br/>
If we approach our kids with the assumption that they&#39;ve done  <br/>
something because they&#39;re mean or bad, they&#39;re far less likely to  <br/>
hear what we have to say. If we approach them assuming they&#39;re doing  <br/>
the best that they can and that they don&#39;t have the skills or  <br/>
understanding to make it work, then we can turn to *helping* them do  <br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
Which person would you rather listen to: someone who assumed you did  <br/>
something deliberately, or someone who assumed you just don&#39;t yet  <br/>
understand?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Again, not all children react this way and some learn<br/>
&gt; respect different ways. YOu know your child.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People who have tried conventional parenting and then switched to  <br/>
mindful parenting can tell you better that their children respond to  <br/>
respect much better than to conventional parenting.<br/>
<br/>
You grew up with neglect. You&#39;re now using conventional parenting.  <br/>
Neither of those is what unschoolers mean when they talk about no rules.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My children would not treat me with disdain or get away with<br/>
&gt; behaviour like that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nor would my daughter. And without conventional parenting or  <br/>
discipline or rules.<br/>
<br/>
I *help* her figure out a better way when she is confused. She  <br/>
*wants* to figure out a better way. She doesn&#39;t want to hurt people.  <br/>
It would create a rift in our relationship if I assumed she wanted to  <br/>
hurt others. That would say to her that I didn&#39;t understand her at  <br/>
all. So why should she listen to me?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am also a human being and deserving of happiness also. And that<br/>
&gt; means we all have to learn to respect one another and follow rules<br/>
&gt; that make life manageble to everyone in the house.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are *all* human beings and deserving of happiness.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember a time when an adult said, &quot;I am also xxx, and  <br/>
deserve yyy,&quot; when they didn&#39;t mean &quot;Sometimes I need use my power  <br/>
over my children in order to get my rights met.&quot; Which means that the  <br/>
best way those parents have figured out how to get their needs met is  <br/>
to be bigger and stronger and make someone else do what they want.  <br/>
And that&#39;s the method they&#39;re modeling for their children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-946194260">&quot;Ignoring is not radical unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
Neglect is never advocated at this list. Giving people freedom to<br/>
choose is one thing, but again, freedom without the awareness is just<br/>
insanity most times.<br/>
<br/>
Mindful parents are very present for their children. They are<br/>
assisting them, guiding them and supporting them every step of the<br/>
way. We are often planning fun events and projects with our children,<br/>
paying close attention to their needs, NOTICING their steps, their<br/>
joys, their sorrows. <br/>
<br/>
Very, very different from the neglect you suffered as a child. I can<br/>
see why you are equating structure and rules with love. What you had,<br/>
was apathy. Apathy is so incredibly hurtful, I&#39;m sorry that was your<br/>
childhood experience.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you from my own experiences though, that although I felt<br/>
much love in my home, a bunch of rules and structure did not make for<br/>
a happy human being in my case. I was pretty angry by the time I hit<br/>
teen years! Still dealing with a lot of that stuff (had it surface<br/>
this week when my very spirited, intense child had a rough week) and I<br/>
really would like to move on!:)<br/>
<br/>
I really believe that the kind of parenting we&#39;re advocating is the<br/>
best of all worlds. We aren&#39;t saying &quot;let the kids alone, they&#39;ll<br/>
figure it all out&quot;...no, no, no! Kids NEED help figuring out social<br/>
constructs and how the world works, how to communicate etc...<br/>
<br/>
But we are saying TRUST them. Trust that they WANT to learn about<br/>
their world, trust that they WANT a guide to assist them kindly and<br/>
gently, trust that they&#39;re always doing their best with the tools<br/>
they&#39;ve gathered so far.<br/>

 I know that there are probably people who disagree with me, but I<br/>
 can speak from my experience.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Yes. On this list there will be!<br/>
<br/>
 -==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I remember being a child who had no limitations at all. I crossed<br/>
 every line I could think of to get my parents to notice me and to<br/>
 protect me from myself. I was pregnant at 17 and scared to death.<br/>
 That didn&#39;t work either. After trying miserably for YEARS to get<br/>
 somone to tell me how to get through life, at 23 I started to figure<br/>
 some things out and really I am so far behind the curve. No<br/>
 education, no chance of employment for more than minimum wage. I<br/>
 never had to do anything. And I never learned to do it until I was<br/>
 grown and really struggle a lot to learn it.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  You weren&#39;t unschooled. Is that what you think <br/>
unschooling/gentle-peaceful parenting looks like?<br/>
<br/>
 You were neglected. I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 There are children who do VERY well with no pressure. There are also<br/>
 some who NEED and WANT structure. It&#39;s not torture to make a child<br/>
 go to bed at a certain time.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  It was for me. 7:00 when I was six and seven. 7:30 when I was eight <br/>
and nine. 8:00 when I was nine and ten. It was still LIGHT outside!!! <br/>
My friends were playing in the street. If I took an hour nap in the <br/>
afternoon, I could stay up an extra half-hour. If I took a two hour nap <br/>
in the afternoon, I could stay up an extra hour.<br/>
<br/>
 It *WAS* torture! I hated it!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s not torture to limit what they eat.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 It certainly can be.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 You have to define what works for each child and ultimatley for your<br/>
 family. I demand respect from my children because I deserve respect<br/>
 from them. I see other parents who dont&#39; demand respect from their<br/>
 children and their children, scream, bite, kick, pull hair, all at<br/>
 their mother. Again, not all children react this way and some learn<br/>
 respect different ways. YOu know your child.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 You can&#39;t demand respect form *any*one! You can *earn* it. That&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
  You don&#39;t deserve respect from your children. Not if you haven&#39;t <br/>
earned it. What have you done to deserve it? What do they say?<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t demand respect from my children, and they don&#39;t scream, bite, <br/>
kick, or pull my hair.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t spank, but I really do mean what I say.<br/>
 My children would not treat me with disdain or get away with<br/>
 behaviour like that.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Or what? What do you do if they try to get away with it?<br/>
<br/>
  How old are they? Do you think that might change as they get older? <br/>
Why or why not?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I am also a human being and deserving of happiness also. And that<br/>
 means we all have to learn to respect one another and follow rules<br/>
 that make life manageble to everyone in the house.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m human and deserving of happiness. So are my children. Do you think <br/>
that they are mutually exclusive?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I am just suggesting that if its not working maybe trying something<br/>
 new would bring about different results. Maybe he is acting out to<br/>
 see if you care enough or are strong enough to stand up to him. To<br/>
 me he sounds angry.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe he&#39;s communicating with you and you&#39;re not understanding what&#39;s <br/>
he&#39;s trying to say. Maybe he&#39;s tired of your standing up to him, and he <br/>
needs your help. To me he sounds frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
 Why not try setting<br/>
 consequences BEFORE you loose your cool. He gets them anyway. And<br/>
 change the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe try losing the &quot;consequences&quot; altogether. Work WITH him. be his <br/>
partner, not his adversary. Find out what&#39;s really wrong instead of <br/>
punishing him for not knowing how to communicate.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe try making him clean up his own mess.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Please don&#39;t. Clean with him. Work with him.<br/>
<br/>
 -=--=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 You know your child and what will get through to him.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  It sounds as if she actually doesn&#39;t. She&#39;s having trouble. She&#39;s <br/>
struggling. Things aren&#39;t getting through to him.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 It might take a while, but consistency works.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Consistently listening and helping and seeing him where he is right <br/>
now. Yes.<br/>

Ouch.<br/>
Reminds me of my teen years. I am a night owl. Have been since puberty<br/>
really. School sucked HARD for that very reason. I would lie awake<br/>
every night WANTING to go to sleep, because I knew I&#39;d be tired the<br/>
next day but couldn&#39;t get tired until after midnight. The first part<br/>
of my school day was spent skipping or sleeping through class. Torture.<br/>

You clarified principles, not rules, but I never thought to call it <br/>
that. <br/>
I don&#39;t have a list of rules saying bed time is at o dark thirty <br/>

care if the book is boring READ IT.<br/>

We are all learning to live respectfully toward one another. None of <br/>
us are angels all the time, but its not an approach of &quot;you must <br/>

***********<br/>
 <br/>
My mother made me go to bed really early, like 6:30 or 7 when I was  younger. <br/>
 She is an early bird and wanted peace and quiet before bed (as  bookwormish <br/>
only child at the time....how much noise was I  making????).   Anyway, I would <br/>
lie in my room for hours and wait until  my parents would go to bed, listen <br/>
for the sounds of them sleeping.  Only  then would I relax and go to sleep.  <br/>
Sometimes I would crawl under their  bed for awhile to feel close to them (until <br/>
I got caught).<br/>
 <br/>
It wasn&#39;t until college that I knew people actually went to bed and went  <br/>
right to sleep.  I thought everybody took hours to wind down like I  did.  One of <br/>
my roommates used to fall asleep to the TV, a habit I adopted  and still have <br/>
20 years later!  Nothing is harder to me than falling asleep  without it. <br/>
 <br/>
My son, once he got old enough, seems to have the same pattern I did  about <br/>
not being able to sleep until the rest of the house does.  It is  something I <br/>
work with because I understand.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if my sleep problems were created by being forced to bed early  <br/>
or just who I am.  But, look how much of my life was wasted by having to  lie <br/>
in bed when I wasn&#39;t asleep.  My son is his most creative at that time,  I <br/>
assume I would have been the same way.<br/>

<br/>
I am a little bit confused about what she says and what I thought I <br/>
understood from RU, I quote: <br/>
&quot;(...) because a toddler wants to learn what his people do, he <br/>
expects to be able to center his attention on an adult who is <br/>
centered on her own business. An adult who stops whatever she is <br/>
doing and tries to ascertain what her child wants her to do is short-<br/>
circuiting this expectation. Just as significantly, she appears to <br/>
the tot not to know how to behave, to be lacking in confidence and, <br/>
even more alarmingly, looking for guidance from him, a two or three <br/>
year old who is relying on her to be calm, competent, and sure of <br/>
herself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It echoes with all your answers to our member that was given freedom <br/>
of everything. But what I don&#39;t get is: is the author telling us that <br/>
we shouldn&#39;t really be playing with our kids? Or just the toddlers? <br/>
In her book The Continuum Concept, she also starts by saying that <br/>
what the children want is not a permissive parent but a &quot;strong, <br/>
busy, central figure to whom he can be peripheral (...)&quot;. I thought <br/>
RU was about being parallel with our children...Need some <br/>
clarification!</div>

schedule, you can pop that on instead and have that nice familiar <br/>
theme music and all. We&#39;re not usually up for really late night TV but <br/>
we do like certain programs as we wind down to sleep and if NONE of <br/>
them are on (rare but possible) we all feel a little antsy. <br/>
Fortunately, one of DS&#39; favorites is the Weather Channel and that&#39;s <br/>
always going with one thing or another. He&#39;ll deliberately tune to <br/>
that and sit and watch sometimes, watch the radar and all for <br/>
everywhere not just our local weather. He&#39;s been fascinated by the <br/>
weather patterns and colorful radar displays since toddlerhood - maybe <br/>
because he was born in Oklahoma?(lol)<br/>
