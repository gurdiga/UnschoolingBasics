&quot;Song for a Fifth Child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mother, oh Mother,<br/>
<br/>
come shake out your cloth,<br/>
<br/>
empty the dustpan,<br/>
<br/>
poison the moth,<br/>
<br/>
hang out the washing<br/>
<br/>
and butter the bread,<br/>
<br/>
sew on a button and make up a bed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where is the mother whose house<br/>
<br/>
is so shocking?<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s up in the nursery,<br/>
<br/>
blissfully rocking.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I&#39;ve grown shiftless as Little<br/>
<br/>
Boy Blue (lullaby, rockaby, lullaby loo).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dishes are waiting and bills are past due<br/>
<br/>
(pat-a-cake, darling, and peek, peekaboo).<br/>
<br/>
The shopping&#39;s not done<br/>
<br/>
and there&#39;s nothing for stew<br/>
<br/>
and out in the yard there&#39;s a hullabaloo<br/>
<br/>
but I&#39;m playing Kanga and this is my Roo.<br/>
<br/>
Look! Aren&#39;t her eyes the most wonderful hue?<br/>
<br/>
(lullaby, rockaby, lullaby loo).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The cleaning and scrubbing<br/>
<br/>
will wait till tomorrow,<br/>
<br/>
for children grow up,<br/>
<br/>
as I&#39;ve learned to my sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
So quiet down, cobwebs.<br/>
<br/>
Dust go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rocking my baby and babies don&#39;t keep&#39;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-266217081">Well, I&#39;m sure I have a few photos of me nursing the boys, but none on digital---or readily handy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could take a current photo, but I believe that, at almost 13 and 21, even avid breastfeeding advocates would consider THAT a bit obscene. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll abstain. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-467308428">I uploaded the basic breastfeeding icon and some famous people nursing that people could snag for their profile pic. A few picked the basic icon and that was fun to see. <br/>
<br/>
An interesting side note is that I realized that I was really passionate about children having access to breastmilk as much as I&#39;m a breastfeeding advocate I totally realize not everyone can. The money spent on and around formula is ridiculous! If we could somehow reroute that money to milk banks and wet nurses I think our societies babies would be much healthier. <br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s complicated but I think it&#39;s worth it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384327894">Ha!  I don&#39;t know where to find mine either; somewhere I have a pic of my<br/>
last tandem session when my dd was 5, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to find<br/>
it and it was yesterday anyway.  What&#39;s that saying about a day late and a<br/>
dollar short?  I think it was written for me, lol!<br/>
<br/>
I still changed my status line though.  Thanks for posting this and maybe<br/>
they&#39;ll try again.<br/>
