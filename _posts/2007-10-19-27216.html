<div id="ygrps-yiv-190351171">i really like the show kid nation, but am also a big survivor fan,<br/>
unfortunately so far  the kids have been fed the ingredients of a<br/>
capitalistic society, but who knows it may change , as for the first<br/>
time one of the kids identified himself as a homeschooler, he won the<br/>
election for town council against a nice boy who seemed to struggle to<br/>
find existence within innumberable constraints of right and wrong<br/>
behavior, way brain washed, poor chap. the home school kid guyan,<br/>
really smacked of unschooling to I, so i wondered if anyone knew if he<br/>
was, and I&#39;m intrigued to see how he&#39;ll represent. patrick</div>
