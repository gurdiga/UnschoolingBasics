Hi, Kelly -<br/>
<br/>
What would such a curriculum look like for a kid who loves comedy,<br/>
like my kid does?  We&#39;re certainly covering a broad range of issues in<br/>
current affairs and politics watching The Daily Show and The Colbert<br/>
Reporr.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I&#39;m glad Meredith chimed in on this one--I&#39;ve been slammed this week <br/>
and am only getting a short break to answer a few emails.<br/>
<br/>
To add to Meredith&#39;s, I was working on this the other day:<br/>

Hi, Kelly -<br/>
<br/>

OK---it&#39;s not so much about &quot;building a curriculum&quot; as it is about <br/>
showing how he&#39;s building his own. So:<br/>
<br/>
He especially loves political comedy? I assume, as an active, <br/>
unschooling mom (as I know you to be! &lt;g&gt;), you are talking with him <br/>
while/after you watch? That you suggest other, similar things he might <br/>
find interesting?<br/>
<br/>
So essentially you&#39;re &quot;covering&quot; the following school subjects:<br/>
<br/>
Math:<br/>
economics<br/>
statistics<br/>
logic<br/>
critical thinking<br/>
<br/>
History & English/Language Arts:<br/>
parody, irony, satire<br/>
literary devices: metaphors, similies, alliteration, etc.<br/>
Mark Twain & Will Rogers<br/>
name a war, any war and a reporter, any reporter<br/>
<br/>
Social Studies:<br/>
current events/politics<br/>
propaganda<br/>
gender roles<br/>
role of media (esp TV) in the 20/21 century<br/>
international (and national) relations<br/>
political campaigns/promises<br/>
<br/>
Geography:<br/>
those boys are all over the map! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else want to add?<br/>
<br/>
