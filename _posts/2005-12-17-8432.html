<br/>
I recommend &quot;Dumbing Us Down: Hidden Curriculum..........&quot; and not  <br/>
the history book unless you have a burning desire to spend hours and  <br/>
hours and HOURS immersed in a New Yorker&#39;s very in-depth view of how  <br/>
public school has developed over the years.<br/>

I read the Underground History on his website _www.johntaylorgatto.com_ <br/>
(http://www.johntaylorgatto.com)  for  free!  Don&#39;t know if it is still there.<br/>
 <br/>
It took awhile, but I enjoyed it.  I have never read the complete  Dumbing Us <br/>
Down, just exerpts.<br/>

I&#39;m just getting around to answering a zillion old e-mails that have been queuing up for weeks. I came across this one that I never even read! &lt;g&gt; Sorry!<br/>
 <br/>
They are two different books. _Dumbing Us Down_ was his first, I believe.<br/>
 <br/>
_The Underground History of American Education_ is a very thick book that can be read online. Try here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/">http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/</a><br/>
