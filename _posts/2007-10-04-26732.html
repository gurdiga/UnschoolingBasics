<div id="ygrps-yiv-550458781">so here is the problem my ds who is 6.5yr has, since a small infant, <br/>
hurt himself when he is upset and i dont know how to stop him.  when <br/>
he was small it was easy to redirect him.....i&#39;d hug him, make funny <br/>
faces, get him to sing a wiggles song etc just anything to keep him <br/>
from hurting himself.  when he was 1.5-2 he&#39;d actually run up against <br/>
walls or bang his head on the floor.  well when sissy arrived 4 years <br/>
ago it seemed to disappear well over the last year it has resurfaced <br/>
and has gotten significantly worse.  when i see the warning signs <br/>
(for instance clinched fists or he starts pulling at his jeans) i sit <br/>
down with him and try to talk to him about it.  i ask him what&#39;s <br/>
bothering him or sometimes i know and i acknowledge it.  <br/>
unfortunately this doesn&#39;t seem to work.  drawing helped for a while <br/>
but he is no longer interested in drawing.  i don&#39;t really know how <br/>
to keep him from hurting himself!<br/>
for instance we had to things happen today where he hurt himself. the <br/>
first one we were driving over the bridge into town to go walk around <br/>
the mall since it was raining all day......his sister took his book <br/>
he was reading to look at the picture......i asked her to give it <br/>
back to bubba bc he was still reading it and she did but by then he <br/>
was very upset, there was no where for me to pull over, i tried to <br/>
explain to him that i could understand why he was upset but he <br/>
started yelling at me said i didn&#39;t understand.....i asked him to <br/>
explain it then and then he started to pinch his thighs.  this all <br/>
happened in about 2 min and as soon as i could i pulled over and we <br/>
got out of the car hugged and he was all better.  the second instance <br/>
was at my parents home this evening.....my mom was cutting my hair, <br/>
my little brother was getting ready for football practice and my dad <br/>
was helping him gt everything together......ds wanted to play go fish <br/>
and i said not right now but as soon as my hair is done in like 5 min <br/>
i will play with you.....he flopped on the couch in the other <br/>
room....when i walked in a few min later he was hitting his forehead <br/>
with the small metal tin that stored his cards and it left a whelp so <br/>
he was hitting pretty hard.  of course when i saw this i talked with <br/>
him and all i got was &quot;i&#39;m bored and mad that no one would play with <br/>
me&quot;  i apologized for not being able to and explained i only sat to <br/>
get my hair trimmed bc he and sissy were outside playing when we <br/>
started.  he said he was mad at me he was mad no one would play cards <br/>
with him.<br/>
so my question is how do i handle this situation.  he has always been <br/>
very sensitive and a loner and usually when he does want to spend <br/>
time with me i am right there.  but so many thing trigger this <br/>
violent behavior.....if it&#39;s raining out side and he wants to go play <br/>
on the swing set he&#39;ll punch his face, or if sissy won&#39;t sit and <br/>
watch his movie with him he&#39;ll pinch or scratch himself etc.....i <br/>
just don&#39;t know what to do!  i am so sorry this is so long but i am <br/>
really worried about him.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138607402">Christian,<br/>
This is my thoughts....I am no&quot;expert&quot;... a couple things come to mind:<br/>
1. you have conditioned him that he can have a negative behavior and get positive feedback for it (check the book The ADD Answer, by Dr. Frank Lawlis, ch.3)...As he grows, they(behaviors) get &quot;bigger&quot;, especially when he is not getting the results he wants and immediately.<br/>
2. Is he on any Ritalin-based med?<br/>
3. Is he diagnosed as having ADD/ADHD and/or autism?<br/>
<br/>
Please, I hope I have not offended you? I am just attempting to help.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as regards my comment 1, I am in no way saying you are doing something bad or wrong...just that kids can be very smart and learn how to &quot;play&quot; us loving, nurturing parental units&lt;G&gt;.My dd with disabilities was a pro! Her tantrums became very aggressive! Taking off a Ritalin-based med, putting her on herbal/homeopathy, and also, when behavior happened she got exactly the opposite of what she was behaving badly about. It worked&lt;G&gt;. She still has some problems, but much more pleasant to be with than when on the drugs and frustrated by public school. BTW, I love unschooling her! So low pressure for both of us, and she does do alot on her own, all things considered.<br/>

<br/>
It may have &quot;worked&quot; in the sense that you are manipulating her<br/>
behavior, but that does nothing to build trusting relationships.<br/>
<br/>
Why should she need to get to a &quot;tantrum&quot; to be heard/validated or get<br/>
what she wants in the first place?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976809161">Both of my daughter&#39;s have done that.  Abbi,  when she was very young, would hit her head on the floor.  She stopped by the time she was around 2.   Kyra was older.  I think she still did it up until she was 8 or 9.  She would get frustrated with something she had done and would hit herself.<br/>
<br/>
I would run to her and hold her and soothe her.  We would talk about her feelings of frustration.  We talked about different ways to deal with anger,  breathing, learning that we make mistakes and not being so hard on ourselves.  I validated her feelings and how much we loved her, hoping she would take care of herself and not hurt herself.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I did the right thing, but she has stopped.  I hope she feels good about herself.  I think she does.  I didn&#39;t want to shame her or anything like that, so I tried to be very thoughtful in how I reacted.  Also I tried to make note of what brought it on.  Could I have helped her sooner, been more attentive so she wouldn&#39;t have gotten so frustrated.  <br/>
<br/>
I know I can&#39;t always curb her frustration but I can help her to deal with her feelings and be there as much as I can to help her deal with difficult situations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-870234773">~~~~~1. you have conditioned him that he can have a negative behavior <br/>
and get positive feedback for it (check the book The ADD Answer, by <br/>
Dr. Frank Lawlis, ch.3)...As he grows, they(behaviors) get &quot;bigger&quot;, <br/>
especially when he is not getting the results he wants and <br/>
immediately~~~~~~<br/>
i understand this logic but we give our children positive feedback <br/>
for the positive things that they accomplish......prob not putting <br/>
this across the right way right now lol.....he gets several times a <br/>
day with just me and him also we when do family things we vote and if <br/>
it&#39;s something that is &quot;kids only&quot; if they don&#39;t agree we sit and <br/>
talk about it until we come to a compromise (i.e; we watch my littel <br/>
ponies then play a game on x-box)......so i guess i am basically <br/>
saying i don&#39;t see how he has been conditioned to act this way in <br/>
order to get the positive feed back<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~ 2. Is he on any Ritalin-based med?~~~~~~<br/>
no we don&#39;t do medications unless it is the last resort i don&#39;t like <br/>
introducing the chemicals to our bodies<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~3. Is he diagnosed as having ADD/ADHD and/or autism?~~~~<br/>
we have had some counselors &quot;suggest&quot; he is adhd.....tried some <br/>
herbal things and we have seen no change really....i don&#39;t feel it is <br/>
add/adhd personally.....we have a few people in the family that have <br/>
it and several freinds w/children w/it and he is not like any of <br/>
them.....i never thought of autism until this week and after reading <br/>
the research i called and made an appointment (rather left a message <br/>
to get an appointment) and plan on calling back tue to get one asap<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
~~~Please, I hope I have not offended you? I am just attempting to <br/>
help.~~~<br/>
i am NOT offended in any way i am looking for help i am worried about <br/>
him.......for years i have been told by most &quot;it&#39;s a phase&quot; or &quot;not <br/>
to worry about it&quot; or &quot;you&#39;ve conditioned him to to that just ignore <br/>
it and he will stop&quot; or &quot;just talk to him about it&quot;  the problem is <br/>
none of this has helped when we&#39;ve talked to him about it his <br/>
response is either &quot;i can control this mom&quot; or &quot; i like the way it <br/>
feels&quot;  which is REALLY disturbing.................well on that note <br/>
i am going to call my mil and see if she found anything in her old <br/>
diaries bc apparently dh was similar to this as a child but not as <br/>
bad so maybe she did something i am not.<br/>
thank  you all,<br/>

kids need a lot of really intense physical stimulation to feel okay. <br/>
Ray used to do things like this a Lot more when he wasn&#39;t getting <br/>
enough rough fun - and I do mean Rough. He was always big for his <br/>
age, so it was a challenge to find people sturdy enough for him to <br/>
rough-house with, but every bit of that helped. <br/>
<br/>
Does your guy like to be pummelled with pillows, rolled up in a <br/>
heavy mat and squashed... things of that nature? Ray was into that <br/>
sort of thing, but also he liked to do great big body movements of <br/>
his own - like jumping off of things, running and running and <br/>
running, hitting things as hard as he could.... You might consider <br/>
adult-size punching bags for that sort of thing, if your furniture <br/>
can&#39;t take the beating. Also, inflatable furniture is great for <br/>
really intense rough play - just don&#39;t expect it to last very long.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that while Ray&#39;s still pretty physical and <br/>
energetic, he doesn&#39;t need nearly as much intense stimulation as he <br/>
used to. So to some extent, it *is* a phase, in that as kids mature <br/>
their needs will change, and that includes these kinds of physical <br/>
needs. But really physical people tend to stay really physical <br/>
lifelong, one way or another. The needs don&#39;t go away, they just <br/>
change.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-390914291">Definitely true... but it&#39;s also true that in some cases having a <br/>
diagnosis and outside help can make all the difference in the world <br/>
in a child&#39;s behavior and in how the family can function. Without <br/>
outside help we would have been lost!! But it&#39;s a fine line, to be <br/>
sure. If my child was doing damage to his or her body (which mine was <br/>
at one point) I would want all the help I could get to help that <br/>
child be more comfortable in her body (and mine was not.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-765922878">Ren,<br/>
The majority of her aggressive behavior came when in public school and on the prescription med. I agree with what you say about her not needing to have a tantrum...etc.... That is why I am learning to unschool her. These behaviors originated in the public school setting, not at home with me, until they had gotten so prevalent, by near the end of  the last school year, she was also doing them at home. So, I sought out and made changes. And I know I am still learning...that&#39;s why I am here&lt;G&gt;. I do see I have much work to do on how I word things to her, as well as when posting&lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I am frequently reminding her to just tell me what is wrong instead or her screaming about it (the main &quot;negative&quot; behavior she still exhibits regularly).<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to undo the damages that were done to her, and welcome helpful comments&lt;G&gt;<br/>

Even  descriptive terms like &quot;intense&quot; and &quot;spirited&quot; can turn into <br/>
pigeonholes  if we&#39;re not very very careful with them. My stepson&#39;s <br/>
mom staunchly  resisted any attempts at &quot;diagnosing&quot; Ray, only to <br/>
turn around and lable  him &quot;difficult&quot;. Its something to watch out <br/>
for, anyway.  <br/>

Yup, I agree with that too. I like having an understanding of Julian&#39;s  <br/>
issues - it helped me grasp that it was NOT him being difficult just to be a  poo, <br/>
lol...and THAT lead me more deeply into unschooling since it helps allow  kids <br/>
to be so themselves :) So, we aren&#39;t formally diagnosed and I don&#39;t see the  <br/>
need for us, to do so. It&#39;s also SUPER helpful for my older kids and for my <br/>
DH,  who are not all unschooly (yet!) to be able to understand that Julian is <br/>
just  the way he is because...he IS :) <br/>

to really work hard with an occupational therapist to make sure we<br/>
found things he could do safely (like diving into deep water ...<br/>

your son find things that meet his sensory needs ... Carol Kranowich&#39;s<br/>

the things that help him feel more &quot;In synch&quot;  so he feels safer in<br/>
his world.    We do lots of jumping into ball pits, pits of foam at<br/>
the gym, squeezing into small spaces, being rolled up into blankets<br/>
and mats, being smooshed under sofa cushions,  pillow fights, punching<br/>
bags, jumping, swinging, running... lots of activity.   Now on the<br/>

them living in harmony is a delicate dance!    <br/>
It&#39;s a shame that society sees these things as dysfunctions rather<br/>
than just seeing them as who these kids are... I just think of it as<br/>
them needing a special diet (sensory) and making sure the things they<br/>
need to be fed are on hand.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424827956"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;drawing helped for a while but he is no longer interested in drawing. i<br/>

 <br/>
**Rowan feels a need to physically express her upsets (and her joy, her<br/>
excitement, etc.).  Some things she&#39;s found helpful:<br/>
 <br/>
-a collection of things to squeeze - varying in texture, shape, and<br/>
firmness. These are the most portable option, and we keep them all over<br/>
the place.<br/>
 <br/>
-a big trampoline outside and a mini-tramp inside<br/>
 <br/>
-a punching bag<br/>
 <br/>
-a balance board<br/>
 <br/>
-an indoor swing<br/>
 <br/>
-a big pile of pillows to bury herself in<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
At six Rowan used all of these things pretty regularly.  She&#39;s ten now,<br/>
and in the past four years she&#39;s developed all sorts of internal tools.<br/>
She&#39;ll plop down and meditate or just close her eyes and take a few deep<br/>
breaths.  But she still sometimes needs to squeeze or pinch or jump or<br/>
punch or just move in some big way, so we keep all of these things (and<br/>
more) easily available.  ~Rue<br/>
