<br/>
William needs more socialization, and this is obvious to me in the following ways:  <br/>
When he is somewhere where there are a lot of children, he holds on to me and does not want to go play...like he hasn&#39;t yet learned that kids are fun to play with!<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes with some of his playthings, some of his games, we reach the end of his and my imagination...I know if he or we were playing with others, that more fun could be invented or extracted from the experience.  You know, just like we all need different perspectives, ideas, experience, and opinions.<br/>
 <br/>
He just needs some other playmates besides Mama!<br/>
{I have been too chicken to add another human to our family yet, LOL!  But it seems like I really need to start considering it.  Will seems lonely...he&#39;s still so attached I am afraid he won&#39;t want to share his Mama...he&#39;ll have less attention and he needs so much of me.  Or else the poor little baby won&#39;t get so much AP!<br/>
This is stupid, but I think about my poor dog, Daisy.  She was my baby, slept next to me every night, rode up front everywhere I went...I sang songs to her all the time, shared my ice cream.  And now she is just a dog...she lives outside and I don&#39;t sing to her much anymore.  I know I won&#39;t neglect Will if I have an infant....actually, I don&#39;t...how can you give undivided attention to two people at the same time...I have found this to be a problem with dh and ds already.  You gals with MANY children...I just don&#39;t understand how you can do it.  I thought I wanted a big family, too, but I don&#39;t know if I can manage more than one baby and a dh at a time!}<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, so sorry to veer so far OT!  I hope we are friends; I&#39;m sending it anyway!<br/>
Love, Millie<br/>

That makes a big difference sometimes.<br/>

you had a child?  I have 2 dogs and they&#39;re inside dogs.  They actually <br/>
don&#39;t seem to LIKE going outside in the yard even just to go to the <br/>
bathroom.  LOL  They don&#39;t get as MUCH attention as they used to from <br/>
me, but they get a ton from my kids now so it all balances out.  ;)<br/>

There&#39;s lots of stuff out there about socialization and also about how <br/>
it really is OK for your child to be &quot;attached&quot; to you.  :)  I like<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-376585924">I hope this doesn&#39;t sound offensive.<br/>
It sounds like she&#39;s implying that her child needs to be pushed <br/>
further out away from her like her dog and go a separate way (maybe <br/>
not too much but something like that).<br/>

**Hi Millie - He&#39;s two?  I really would not worry about him still wanting to<br/>
hold onto you in social situations.  I think the more you *don&#39;t* push him<br/>
to socialize the better off he&#39;ll be.  When he&#39;s ready to get into the thick<br/>
of things he will.<br/>
<br/>
What is he doing that&#39;s leading you to believe he&#39;s lonely?  ~Rue<br/>

<br/>
I just want to reiterate my original question here was about socializ-ING,<br/>
as in being with people in social situations, not the much broader and<br/>
&quot;weaponized&quot; (against homeschoolers AND sometimes against schooled children)<br/>
concept of Socialization. This is another area where we are choosing a<br/>
lifestyle of trusting in and honoring our children&#39;s individuality and<br/>
development. I probably could have written a whole &quot;buzz words&quot; post just<br/>
about that one, but I think others have it covered. I endorse the online<br/>
articles that were mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
My reasons for asking the question were, firstly, that I was interested in<br/>
other folks insights into more of the non-verbal cues that their children<br/>
were giving. It&#39;s easy when you have a gregarious child who is always<br/>
saying, &quot;Who am I meeting today?&quot; Jayn is sometimes like that, but usually<br/>
it is harder to get her out of the house, even if she was keen earlier in<br/>
the day. She sometimes seems eager to meet up with a friend, then loses<br/>
enthusiasm once we get there. She definitely does better with one playmate,<br/>
than several, except occasionally. As I said, she is clearer about her &quot;not&quot;<br/>
desires than her &quot;yes&quot; desires. I have learnt the futility of taking her<br/>
somewhere she does not wish to go, in terms of play dates or the park, as<br/>
she will rarely engage with anyone, sometimes hurting feelings by being<br/>
aloof, and we always leave quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly I thought it might spark some interesting discussions and thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Some meanings from dictionary sources:<br/>
<br/>
so·cial·ize    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (ssh-lz)<br/>
v. so·cial·ized, so·cial·iz·ing, so·cial·iz·es <br/>
v. tr.<br/>
1. To place under government or group ownership or control. [public school?]<br/>
2. To make fit for companionship with others; make sociable. <br/>
3. To convert or adapt to the needs of society. <br/>
<br/>
v. intr.<br/>
To take part in social activities.<br/>
<br/>
Source: The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth<br/>
Edition<br/>
<br/>
so·cial·i·za·tion (ssh-l-zshn)<br/>
n. <br/>
<br/>
The process of learning interpersonal and interactional skills that are in<br/>
conformity with the values of one&#39;s society.<br/>
<br/>
socialization<br/>
<br/>
n 1: the act of meeting for social purposes; &quot;there was too much<br/>
socialization with the enlisted men&quot; [syn: socialisation, socializing] <br/>
2: the adoption of the behavior patterns of the surrounding culture [syn:<br/>
socialisation, acculturation]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On a related note: I have the hardest time getting past the fact that Jayn<br/>
absolutely seems to adore a child (our neighbor 6.5yo) that neither my dh<br/>
nor I like in the slightest. She has to be watched every second when she is<br/>
here, especially since recently she keeps trying to touch Jayn&#39;s private<br/>
parts, and follows her to the bathroom, and has even tried to take Jayn to<br/>
the bathroom with her. She is very sexual it seems to me, her favorite TV<br/>
show is clearly a teem program and she talks about boyfriends etc. She tries<br/>
to get Jayn to take part in secrets with her, that are basically about her<br/>
trying to get around the myriad of rules that her mother has - like sneaking<br/>
candy. It is very hard since we have no food restrictions of any kind, but<br/>
the other girl has a &quot;weight problem&quot; and mucho restrictions, according to<br/>
her mother. Very definitely traditional ordinary parents with constant<br/>
punishing, including ear grabbing.<br/>

My DS (5) is sometimes verbal about wanting to get together with <br/>
friends.  Often he&#39;ll ask to play with a specific friend or ask when <br/>
we&#39;re going to go to their house again.  Sometimes I need to put <br/>
together clues in order to get out of the house / go on an outing.  <br/>
Especially watching my DD (3) because she doesn&#39;t ask to go play with <br/>
so-and-so or anything.  When my kids are bouncing off the walls or <br/>
being mean to each other (and it&#39;s not due to hunger or being tired) <br/>
then that&#39;s my cue to gather everyone up and head to a park, or the <br/>
zoo, or a museum, or my mom&#39;s.  Just a change of scenery is what is <br/>
needed for us -- though not necessarily a &quot;play date&quot; per se.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that....it&#39;s often hard to get both kids dressed and out <br/>
the door.  :)  They&#39;ll both be so excited about going <br/>
wherever-we&#39;re-going and I end up chasing them around putting on a sock <br/>
here, pants here, etc.  It&#39;s not uncommon for me to dress one, go to <br/>
dress the other, then need to re-dress the first one because they&#39;ve <br/>
since removed their socks or -- in the case of my DD -- her panties!  <br/>
It&#39;s sometimes exhausting for me just to get them out the door.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that answered your question or not though.  ;)<br/>
