<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025352593">Hi,<br/>
Im looking for some input from anyone willing share! Although we have been parenting in a &quot;child led learning&quot; type of Way since my boys were born, now that my oldest son is 6 I Im looking for some guidance on weather we should and/or need to join a charter school? All of the ones that I have looked at are not even close to being a match for us. What other options do I have? I know that requirements change from state to state and we are in California. Ive done alot of searching online and I finally figured the best way to find out is probably just to ask :)I just love the &quot;unschooling&quot; Idea, its aa perfect fit for our family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630275200">Joining a radical unschooling list to ask about your school options (for a six-year-old?) isn&#39;t a perfect fit for anyone, at home or online. It is from frustrating personal experience that I learned how misinformative and even divisive charter school discussions can get among well-meaning parents. <br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s don&#39;t go there, here.<br/>
<br/>
What is it do you think, that&#39;s focusing you on schooling right now? Is it an urge from within yourself or coming from expectations and even pressure from partner, family members, neighbors? Knowing why you are looking at school programs can help you get to unschooling, maybe all by itself and probably better than learning a lot about charters. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672788425">Are you concerned about your legal options? Go to the HomeSchool Association of California&#39;s website for information on how to register your own, very private, private school, as well as your other legal options in CA. LOTS of radical unschoolers in California, most of whom don&#39;t go anywhere near the charters. <br/>

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still possible to register for the HSC conference that begins this coming Thursday. It is a VERY unschooling friendly conference, with lots to do for kids and parents alike. Sandra Dodd is speaking as well as many other unschoolers. Oh, it looks like you can still register! <br/>

Do you need a charter school? No.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307683624">A local unschooling list is what you need for details on the subject. There&#39;s a collection of local lists here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/world">http://sandradodd.com/world</a><br/>
<br/>
On a more general note, unschooling is technically a form of home-education, so you&#39;ll be following the same laws and proceedures as other area homeschoolers. Most unschoolers look for the least intrusive way to meet those laws. That could be a simple as a letter of intent to the local school board, but in some areas its less intrusive to go through an &quot;umbrella school&quot; - and I don&#39;t know if charter schools are the same sort of thing, honestly. If the &quot;school&quot; is simply a means for placating the law and doesn&#39;t get in your way, great. We use a &quot;school&quot; like that for Ray, here in TN, and the way the legalities work, he&#39;s essentially a student of a private religious school and that school recognizes us as &quot;teachers&quot;. Since private church-based schools aren&#39;t regulated, here, anything we do is between us and the school, and we&#39;ve found one that&#39;s unschooling-friendly. <br/>
<br/>
Regardless of whether you decide to unschool, its best to know the law and loopholes as thoroughly as you can. Double-check any advice you get from other homeschoolers and homeschool organizations as some of them will suggest you do things that aren&#39;t necessary and can cause issues down the road. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974370792">I think my original question could have been worded a little different but yes I am asking from a legal standpoint, which is why I am looking to better understand my rights & options. I am looking for advice now that he is  6 only because as I am percieving things, I think that is the age that a parent would register something somewhere if need be (emphasis on the &quot;if need be&quot; part).<br/>
<br/>
I am blessed to have family and friends who are for the most part supportive in our decision to unschool, but I guess its something within me that is looking for some peace of mind that we are making this journey as legal as possible. I guess im a little uneasy since I have only found a tiny handfull (by tiny handfull I mean 1!) unschooler in our area, who is also 6 yrs old.<br/>
<br/>
From one human being who is a little scared at the moment to another human being who may have some wisdom to offer, I am grateful so thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Meredith, I will definatley check out the Sandra Dodd website & I especially like the idea of a letter of intent to the school board.<br/>
<br/>
Deborah, I will take another look at the California Homeschoolerds Association website because it would be really great to be able to register &quot;my very own, very private, private school&quot;! The HSC conference looks like just what we need right now. I was tearing up reading the description because although I am generally a person who goes within for guidance and acceptance, right now I am needing to be a little supported and this looks amazing for us. Thursday is a little close but Im going to see what I can do to get our family there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57793547">I&#39;m also in California. We took our boys out of 2nd grade last November, and<br/>
have been deschooling and unschooling since then. My husband is not<br/>
comfortable with unschooling yet, so I agreed to sign up for a charter<br/>
school to calm my husband&#39;s fears while still being able to keep the kids<br/>
home and our marriage intact. Our &quot;teacher&quot; seems to be very helpful in<br/>
letting us unschool, and help us translate into educationese what we are<br/>
doing. We will have to follow the California standards somehow, and then<br/>
test at the end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
So while I agree that this is not the place to discuss schools, a charter<br/>
school is after all a public school, I also know that many unschoolers in my<br/>
area use charter schools because they get money for classes and educational<br/>
toys. This can be a help for many. And their kids are willing to put up with<br/>
producing some work samples and do testing in exchange for this.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m hoping to achieve by going with a charter school this year, is my<br/>
husband&#39;s approval to NOT do it next year. I hope he will see that we don&#39;t<br/>
need it, and that by making our unschooling life rich and interesting they<br/>
are learning all they need to without the external pressure of a curriculum<br/>
that doesn&#39;t fit into our lives. This year, our boys are supposed to learn<br/>
cursive. Well, they can barely write now. I&#39;d much rather just wait until<br/>
they are ready to learn it. I know they are not ready now and still it&#39;s on<br/>
the program for this year. That&#39;s not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about how I can unschool and make life as good as<br/>
possible within those limits: I can use the curriculum, or California<br/>
standards, as a list of things I can expose the children to, it can be like<br/>
an idea list. In school, the kids never get through the whole thing anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I want to unschool, and I want/need my husband to be on board. The charter<br/>
school may be a detour, or a slow zone, but I hope that we eventually will<br/>
reach our destination together!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255985958">In CA, once your child reaches &#39;school age&#39;, you send in an R4 affidavit<br/>
and you become your own private school. Once you&#39;re a private school,<br/>
you pretty much do whatever however. If you&#39;ve looked online, have you<br/>
checked the local/state homeschool groups? I know that there are several<br/>
very active statewide websites that include information on filing the<br/>
R4. Most charter schools are still part of the public school system with<br/>
all the attendant requirements (give or take, some may be a little more<br/>
flexible in how you meet those requirements). Some look good because<br/>
they offer lots of &#39;free&#39; materials and resources...except &#39;free&#39; comes<br/>
with strings.<br/>

I live in California and recently filed the R4 affidavit.  It was very simple and I received several helpful emails answering my questions when I contacted someone on the website.  Below is the email address if you&#39;d like to contact them.  Good luck!<br/>
