<div id="ygrps-yiv-643475757">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
David and I began our unschooling journey in December 2005- He was <br/>
taken out of 4th grade because of various reasons- not doing work, <br/>
anger issues, concentration issues (adhd), etc. It was not a good <br/>
parting. This past december his anger took a new level when he hit <br/>
me when I slapped him for cussing at me. The police were called- cps <br/>
investigated and found no abuse in the household. David started <br/>
intensive therapy and during the conversations with the therapist he <br/>
said something about his dad that opened another cps investigation <br/>
back in Janurary. Yesterday they started the investigation. I told <br/>
them about unschooling and now they are investigating that. They <br/>
want some sort of documentation about unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
So if you have had to deal with unschooling and cps investigations, <br/>
how have you showed documentation? My state requires portfolio or <br/>
testing every year, I have gotten portfolios and comunicated with <br/>
the woman (a certified teacher) who examines it by mail and e-mail. <br/>
I tell her in a letter what all we have done in the year citing the <br/>
different areas (math, science, history, english, pe, etc) and what <br/>
respective thing we have done. This year David is going to take the <br/>
standardized test with the school- becuase we are looking at getting <br/>
him back in school- the therapost has reccommened it- he says one of <br/>
david&#39;s problems is &quot;too much mommy&quot;. He&#39;s 13 now. Therapist also <br/>
says his socialization skills are way down.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in adviance for any help.<br/>
Rachel</div>

 </span></blockquote>Why *wouldn&#39;t* he hit if that&#39;s the method you use when you disagree  <br/>
with him?? It doesn&#39;t sound like escalation. It sounds like you&#39;ve  <br/>
taught him will how to respond to anyone he doesn&#39;t agree with.<br/>
<br/>
At 13 this will only get worse. Kids are biologically wired to begin  <br/>
pulling away and trying independence during the teen years. He needs  <br/>
less control and more support and help. To help him, to help you, to  <br/>
help avoid future problems with CPS, you need better ways of relating  <br/>
with him.<br/>

which is about better ways to respond and *be* with our kids not just  <br/>
how not to spank. It&#39;s what to do instead of hitting, yelling and  <br/>
trying to control. It&#39;s about relating to kids and being their  <br/>
partner rather than their controller.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;ll need more state specific advice, though. What state are you  <br/>
in? Perhaps someone can point you in the direction of a state list.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some more peaceful parenting resources that people here have  <br/>
suggested:<br/>
<br/>
UNCONDITIONAL PARENTING<br/>
<br/>
Alfie Kohn has an &#39;unconditional parenting&#39; message board:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unconditionalparentingboard.com/eve.">http://unconditionalparentingboard.com/eve.</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CONSENSUAL LIVING<br/>
<br/>
- OH! Pam Genant&#39;s consensual living  e-list!<br/>
<br/>
- Is this one? I belong to that group and the description looks  <br/>
applicable.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Consensual-living/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Consensual-living/</a><br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the description:<br/>
Description<br/>
<br/>
Consensual living is a process, a philosophy, a mindset by which we  <br/>
seek to live in harmony with our families and community. It involves  <br/>
finding mutually agreed upon solutions, where the needs of both  <br/>
parties are not only considered but addressed. Everyoneï¿½s wants and  <br/>
needs are equally valid, regardless of age. Conflicting wants or  <br/>
needs are discussed and mutually agreeable solutions are created or  <br/>
negotiated which meet the underlying needs of all parties.<br/>
<br/>
Beginners to this concept are welcome to join this list, living  <br/>
consensually is an ongoing process of discovery. We ask that you be  <br/>
open to or on the path toward living consensually. We hope to explore  <br/>
the issues by asking questions, and sharing our experiences.  <br/>
Parenting is a sensitive issue for many people but we are all here to  <br/>
practice this process, and can do so if the environment remains one  <br/>
of respect, compassion, exploration and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ENJOY PARENTING<br/>
<br/>
- You might like enjoyparenting.com<br/>
<br/>
- My hands-down all time fave is Scott Noelle&#39;s site.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.enjoyparenting.com/">http://www.enjoyparenting.com/</a><br/>
His Daily Groove emails are the *best*.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MOTHERING.COM<br/>
<br/>
[This one looks more wide-ranging in parenting styles though  <br/>
definitely away from punishment. But a wide range can be good. When I  <br/>
first started reading about unschooling, I read about it through  <br/>
AOL&#39;s homeschooling message boards where all styles of homeschooling  <br/>
had folders, from the most rigid curriculum  users to the most  <br/>
radical unschoolers ;-) And I could see the pros and cons and  <br/>
arguments for each side. -- Joyce]<br/>
<br/>
- What about mothering.com I know that they have quite a few schooling<br/>
parents there.<br/>
<br/>
- How about mothering.com? If I think of any more, I&#39;ll let you know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ATTACHMENT PARENTING<br/>
<br/>
For in person get togethers though I think the intent is to be about  <br/>
parenting, a lot of the focus seems to be on babies though I could be  <br/>
wrong. -- Joyce<br/>
<br/>
- Also there is the Attachment Parenting International<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.attachmentparenting.org">http://www.attachmentparenting.org</a><br/>
<br/>
- Attachment Parenting International has a website. As well I&#39;m on a  <br/>
small yahoo group called Saskatoon APNFL (attachment parenting/  <br/>
natural family living). Most of us live in Saskatchewan (Canada) but  <br/>
I&#39;m sure the moderator would welcome other members.<br/>
<br/>
- What about Attachment Parenting International?  I have connections  <br/>
with the people who run the agency and once they even gave my son a  <br/>
peaceful parenting t-shirt.  Since getting into RU, I don&#39;t read as  <br/>
much about attachment parenting but I do know that they have info  <br/>
specifically for families who children are school age. I cannot say  <br/>
how in alignment what API promotes is with RU.  I do know that that  <br/>
is organization that seeks to have children brought up in a manner  <br/>
that is loving, respectful and most of all, peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
- I sub to SAH-AP and that was the radical ap set there.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kjsl.com/sah-ap/">http://www.kjsl.com/sah-ap/</a><br/>
I&#39;ve been nomail for a while, but it used to be the hardcore list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335454002">Rachel, <br/>
   I&#39;m so sorry for what you are going thorugh. It looks like Joyce <br/>
gave you lot and lots of resources. I haven&#39;t been through what you are <br/>
talking about (and I hope never to), but I did have some thoughts upon <br/>
reading your post-<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; So if you have had to deal with unschooling and cps investigations, <br/>
&gt; how have you showed documentation? My state requires portfolio or <br/>
&gt; testing every year, I have gotten portfolios and comunicated with <br/>
&gt; the woman (a certified teacher) who examines it by mail and e-mail. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>   I would think the only documentation you would need to provide CPS <br/>
is what you need to provide the school each year. That is all I would <br/>
offer them. Schooling is certainly more the schools responsibility than <br/>
CPS&#39;s so if the school is happy with the documentation, it should <br/>
satisfy CPS too. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This year David is going to take the <br/>
&gt; standardized test with the school- becuase we are looking at getting <br/>
&gt; him back in school- the therapost has reccommened it- he says one of <br/>
&gt; david&#39;s problems is &quot;too much mommy&quot;. He&#39;s 13 now. Therapist also <br/>
&gt; says his socialization skills are way down.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally I think I would seek out another therapist, for another <br/>
opinion. Of course I don&#39;t know your situation, and maybe you agree <br/>
with what yours is saying, BUT, are you sure they are not just giving <br/>
you a mainstream thinking answer? How many homeschoolers have heard <br/>
these same arguments - &quot;too much mommy&quot;, low &quot;socilaization skills&quot;, <br/>
from others? Also, you indicated that your son had some <br/>
emotional/behavorial issues, that were there when he was in school. I <br/>
would seriously think about that. Is it his emotional/behavorial issues <br/>
that may be causing this supposed lack of socilaization skills? And not <br/>
your homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t take this wrong, I&#39;m just trying to offer suggestions.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This past december his anger took a new level when he hit <br/>
me when I slapped him for cussing at me. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I would change this to:  &quot;our&quot; anger.  *Our* anger hit a new level.  <br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;ve been hitting this person (your son) for 13 years and this is the <br/>
first time he has hit back, I&#39;d say his frustration hit a new level.  You being <br/>
hit by a 13 year old is enough to call the police but when you hit him (slap, <br/>
if you prefer) he can&#39;t even hit back?  Why didn&#39;t he call the police after <br/>
you hit him?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The police were called- cps investigated and found no abuse in the household. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I am reading about abuse.  You are writing about abuse.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
My first thought is that I&#39;d forget about *handling* CPS and focus on this <br/>
child of yours before its too late.  Go hug him now and tell him that you love <br/>
him and *love him*.  Then you can work on trying to build a relationship and <br/>
working together towards a life of joy.  Look at things through his eyes and ask <br/>
yourself how you&#39;d be responding to being treated like he&#39;s been treated -- <br/>
at school?  At home? Think of something outrageously sweet and thoughtful you&#39;d <br/>
do for a friend that had been through similar troubles and then do it for <br/>
your son.  Do it today. Treat today like it is your last day together.  Enjoy <br/>
each other and see all the good in each other.  Can you take a vacation together?<br/>
 <br/>
Something brought you to this list (just in time!) and I&#39;d treat it as the <br/>
blessing it is and start reading the archives and following the links.  This <br/>
list inspires change through personal growth and awareness rather than teaching <br/>
how to change others or how to breed conformists that don&#39;t cuss.  I&#39;d rather <br/>
hear cussing than hear about another frustrated thirteen year old shooting his <br/>
classmates and teachers.  Cussing is better than slapping, too.<br/>
 <br/>
Lastly, ignore recommendations from therapists that make no sense.  It sounds <br/>
like your son has a lot of healing to do since his negative parting with the <br/>
school so if anyone recommends throwing him back into that fire, I&#39;d seek a <br/>
second opinion. Anyone that suggests there&#39;s such a thing as too much Mommy <br/>
should be studying gorillas rather than advising parents and families.  Who does <br/>
your son have for support? If a child cannot feel (and be) supported by his <br/>
mother, from whom should he seek it?  Teachers?  Fellow students? Drugs?  The <br/>
therapist?  Therapy can be like a buffet, take what works and leave the rest.  No <br/>
therapist can love your son or be a better parent to him than you.  Be that <br/>
parent starting right now. Be his friend. Treat him like you want to be <br/>
treated.  Let go of your own anger and model the behavior you want to see.  Our <br/>
children ultimately become us.  Teach him, show him kindness and joy and you&#39;ll see <br/>
more of it from him. Our world needs more kindness and less hitting.  Help us <br/>
get there!<br/>
 <br/>
Best wishes to your family,<br/>
Robin in Cape Cod, MA<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-759365112">Hai Rachel,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Laila and I am Dutch and live in the Netherlands. My son is 8 and has<br/>
the same problems. <br/>
<br/>
And I want to tell you how I see things. Maybe it helps you.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in adhd. It&#39;s made up. I don&#39;t know how religeous you are.<br/>
But I believe there is more than the eye can see.<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;sees&#39; peoples energy.And he fights the evil energy. Because he was<br/>
suppressed at school he got angry and had concentration issues.<br/>
<br/>
His teacher had very black energy and he brought her to the light.after that<br/>
she was a lot nicer and he felt like he finished school. So we quit(this is<br/>
the short version;)). My kids are now 1,5 month at home and I have to say.<br/>
Bacouse he couldn&#39;t get angry at school anymore he got angry at me. As you<br/>
might know the only thing you can really change in this world is your self.<br/>
So I changed my behaviour to him. I let him do what ever he wanted and let<br/>
him stay up as late as he wanted. This acted out in tv,x-box,psp,gameboy and<br/>
pc all day and night. ( Idecided not to worry) and I also told him that when<br/>
I asked him something he could refuse . wich he does very aggressefly(?) :-)<br/>
I also told him I&#39;d try not to yell at him and asked him not to be grumpy at<br/>
my. And to be hounest since I let go of him acting &#39;normal&#39; hes acting more<br/>
&#39;normal&#39;. And today I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;ll let go of the foodthing too. He<br/>
can eat whenever and whatever he wants.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A hard thing for me is that my family don&#39;t understand homeschooling let<br/>
alone unschooling. It makes me doubt my descions. But I&#39;ve learnt to listen<br/>
to my heart . And that is actually what I wanted to tell you listen to your<br/>
heart and figure out what works for you and your family. Don&#39;t let the<br/>
police, the neighbours, your family or a therapist tell you what to do. Give<br/>
your son the time to adjust to home and let him be himself. Don&#39;t push him<br/>
just let him be. I found out my son had a lot of old anger just by talking<br/>
about it. Don&#39;t see him as a child that didn&#39;t work at all. When I started<br/>
talking to him and respecting him like person/human being he starte to<br/>
relax. And I&#39;m not saying that everything is perfect now. (far from that)<br/>
but we are getting closer everyday and I learn everyday from my kids.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Lots of love laila<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you did something that got me cussing at you, and then you slapped  <br/>
me and I hit back, would you think I had anger issues and needed  <br/>
therapy? What you need is family therapy and if you persist in  <br/>
viewing him as the problem then your relationship is doomed and he  <br/>
could well spend his life acting out his anger by directing it at  <br/>
others or at himself.<br/>
<br/>
Please read this book as soon as possible: &quot;Parent-Teen Breakthrough:  <br/>
The Relationship Approach.&quot; It is by Mira Kirschenbaum and is  <br/>
available used on Amazon for one cent plus shipping. Here is a link:<br/>

No excuses - go order this book and read it immediately. It really  <br/>
and truly could save your relationship with your son.<br/>
<br/>
Also, don&#39;t try to justify unschooling to cps workers. Why on earth  <br/>
would you think that they could possibly &quot;get it?&quot; Very very very  <br/>
very unlikely and you&#39;ll end up being accused of neglect. Quite  <br/>
honestly, I don&#39;t understand how you can unschool if the level of  <br/>
anger in your relationship is to the point that you&#39;re hitting each  <br/>
other and calling the police.<br/>
<br/>
Tell them, instead, that you use an eclectic fully-integrated  <br/>
curriculum which is highly individualized to fully utilize your  <br/>
child&#39;s learning style. For more educationeze ways of describing it,  <br/>
you can use this course of study that I have for the private  <br/>
independent study program I run here in California:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217491349">~~How can you teach a child NOT to hit when YOU HIT THEM?~~<br/>
<br/>
Good point.<br/>
<br/>
My coworkers and I witnessed a toddler &quot;tantrum&quot; the other day at our<br/>
store. The wee child was really melting down and started to hit out at<br/>
her Mum (as her Mum is carrying her gently away to deal with the<br/>
emotions). <br/>
<br/>
One of our co-workers said &quot;uh-UH...if that was my son I&#39;d beat his<br/>
butt&quot;.  Two of us turned around in disbelief and said &quot;Oh, THAT&#39;S<br/>
really brilliant...hit him teach him that hitting is not ok??&quot;<br/>
She didn&#39;t say much after that.<br/>
<br/>
Later, when the Mum of angry toddler came back (with a calm, happy<br/>
child in tow) I applauded her for being calm and sweet while deaing<br/>
with her childs intense emotions. She looked so relieved and later<br/>
thanked me for being supportive. Apparently she doesn&#39;t get much<br/>
support for not spanking...it was such a breathe of fresh air to see<br/>
kindness towards an angry child in public.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818937115">Hello- earlier this year I contacted several unschooling forums with <br/>
assistance in dealing with CPS and unschooling. I would like to let <br/>
you all know the happy conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
When the cps worked contacted me about the educational neglect she <br/>
gave me the impression it was about unschooling. Come to find out it <br/>
had nothing per say with unschooling but that my NOI was not on file <br/>
with the county board. I resolved that and the cps investigation has <br/>
been completed with no neglect found. I recieved the letter last week.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your contacts and support.<br/>
Be well,<br/>
Rachel</div>
