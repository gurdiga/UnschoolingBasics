<div id="ygrps-yiv-398972087">To all my un-schooling conterparts nationwide <br/>
 <br/>
I have come across an issue that I need some useful suggestive help with <br/>
 <br/>
it&#39;s the city in which we live - Woonsocket RI <br/>
 <br/>
While my son has only been away from the public school system for a short time (May of 2004) <br/>
 <br/>
We are now required to administer assessment tests and I am to give the school a copy of what we cover on a weekly basis<br/>
 <br/>
how do you all get around such a thing?<br/>
 <br/>
they want to know what science we are covering<br/>
what mathematics, history, english and the like <br/>
and if they aren&#39;t satisfied with the answers I provide<br/>
I could loose my son to the public school system, which by the way is the reason I have decided to educate my children at home<br/>
 <br/>
he was on an IEP and never received the resources per the IEP agreement because I chose not to medicate him, he doesn&#39;t need drugs he needs encouragement and he needs to know that he is a vitale person in todays society not that he doesn&#39;t measure the standards set forth by the school system<br/>

Hi Jeff,<br/>
Congratulations on your new little baby! <br/>
It is good that you are learning about unschooling so early; this philosophy encompasses your (and your child&#39;s) whole life, and it will be a wonderful gift to her to have complete freedom from birth! Regarding your question about how to &quot;teach&quot; her the fundamentals, let me assure you that unschooling works. You will soon see your dd&#39;s innate drive to learn and its strength. Trust it. She will learn everything that she needs to learn. You will be able to help her by answering her questions, showing her how to seek answers on her own. You will not ever need to introduce her to topics for which she hasn&#39;t expressed an interest. If you haven&#39;t devoured Sandra Dodd&#39;s site yet, I encourage you to do so, and I am sure many others will do the same. The beauty of unschooling is that you relax and trust that learning is inevitable. My own ds, always unschooled, is not yet three, and he is already entirely literate, reading well, nearly as fast as I do and including extremely long or<br/>
difficult words...he also has broad knowledge in diverse fields: I would go so far as to call him an expert on the Solar System, rocks and minerals, and mushrooms; and he is intimate w maps on all levels from the geological survey of our immediate area to the map of the world and can id most of the US states and over half of the countries of the world. He is computer literate as well. This is all from following his own interests and having his questions answered (from the time he could point at everything and only say &quot;Dis?&quot;), and I assure you I have never once sat him down and said &quot;Okay, son, let&#39;s learn about x now.&quot; My only part in this, aside from as I said, answering many questions, has been reading to him whenever he desired. I have also done some strewing; I purchased the Children&#39;s World Atlas after I noticed him studying a map in a waiting area, and have made other such purchases...he is always welcome to do what he likes with these materials (and he does choose to<br/>
study them). But it is important for me to not value his reading the atlas, say, over playing on the computer, or watching TV, as there is tremendous value and learning opportunities in every aspect of life.<br/>
Jeff, I would like to advise you to not concern yourself much with your state laws at this point. I understand why you are concerned and interested, and I myself felt this way. But there are several years before your child is of compulsary school age, and in that time these standards needn&#39;t concern you at all (and then of course there are many years beyond that before she would be &quot;3rd grade&quot; age). The thing is, states&#39; laws change. Homeschooling is becoming more and more widespread and accepted and you may find that the laws in your state are totally different once your child reaches that age. You will be able to unschool your daughter wherever you live and you will be able to figure out the best way to deal w your state when that time comes. When I started researching states laws I didn&#39;t know that I would be living in a different state now (so all that research was really pointless). But, I did happen to research the laws of the state where I now reside, as it was<br/>
bordering my own. At that time, in this state (MS), the laws stated that to homeschool your children you needed to be a certified tutor and submit all sorts of records and logs, etc. Now (less than 3 years later) this state has one of the most relaxed homeschooling laws and all a parent must do is send in a note once a year stating the children&#39;s names and that they will homeschool.<br/>
Anyway, Jeff, enjoy your daughter and be amazed as you watch her learn every day of her life. You don&#39;t have to teach her; your job is to protect her freedom and allow the relaxed environment where learning comes easily.<br/>
Good luck on your journey together!<br/>
Millie<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process,<br/>
how do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic<br/>
achievement?<br/>
<br/>
Our goal is a healthy, happy, well-adjusted daughter, unlimited in<br/>
her future prospects - while keeping Mom and Dad out of jail for<br/>
failing to follow the rules.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is a healthy, happy, well-adjusted child, then grades <br/>
and academic achievments don&#39;t really matter, do they?:)<br/>
I think the best way to have a happy, well-adjusted child, is to let <br/>
them learn the things that interest them, just as you do (you&#39;ve <br/>
already figured out the forced variety doesn&#39;t work). It&#39;s all about <br/>
providing a rich environment, taking her the places you&#39;re all <br/>
interested in, meeting a variety of people, and all of you pursuing <br/>
what you love.<br/>
In a home where parents are pursuing their interests, and inviting <br/>
their children to join in whenever possible, enthusiasm and learning <br/>
seem to bubble up quite naturally. We don&#39;t live our lives with <br/>
grades, with focus on academics to satisfy some government authority <br/>
(or nosey family members), we live our lives doing the things we <br/>
love...ALL of us.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to the &quot;links&quot; section of this website, you will have <br/>
hours and hours of reading available on the topic of unschooling. <br/>
There are many sites on all things related to unschooling there, but <br/>
I recommend starting with SandraDodd.com.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the in-laws, you&#39;ve got a few years. Don&#39;t borrow trouble <br/>
from the future, just plant a few seeds here and there. If you&#39;re <br/>
going to choose the unschooling lifestyle, one of the requirements <br/>
is to grow a thick skin and gather some pointed, brief phrases to <br/>
shut people up when necessary!!:)<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the site, and the learning journey with your sweet child <br/>
that has already begun.:)<br/>

reading well,<br/>
nearly as fast as I do and including extremely long or<br/>
difficult words...he also has broad knowledge in diverse fields:&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of things to say about what Millie posted...first of <br/>
all, she isn&#39;t exaggerating ONE tiny bit about her child!!:) He&#39;s <br/>
more literate than both my 7 and 11 year old children. It&#39;s really <br/>
weird to have a 2y.o. reading over your shoulder while you&#39;re on the <br/>
computer, let me tell you!!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, but the important point I wanted to make is that unschooling is <br/>
not result oriented. Millie&#39;s child reads at 2. I have a child that <br/>
is really a beginning reader for all intents and purposes, at the <br/>
age of 11. It&#39;s all good.<br/>
Whether your child does things &quot;early&quot; or &quot;late&quot; according to the <br/>
school system, it doesn&#39;t matter to unschoolers. What matters is a <br/>
life of joy, pursuing that which we love.<br/>
Some kids will do things that society worships (like reading) at <br/>
very young ages, others will not. What I love about these unschooled <br/>
minds, is that they don&#39;t have to be labeled, graded or compared to <br/>
other people. They can SHINE (Anne Ohman&#39;s term) for who they are, <br/>
right now, today.<br/>
What a beautiful gift.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you already realized this Jeff, but I just didn&#39;t want a <br/>
newbie thinking that kids will start reading at 2 or 3 just because <br/>
they&#39;re &quot;unschoolers&quot; (in reality, they&#39;re just being toddlers at <br/>
that age). It&#39;s about your precious child being who she is, and all <br/>
of you discovering new things together.<br/>

From: &quot;Tina&quot; <br/>
Subject: How do you do it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have a question that has partly to do with the unschooling <br/>
way of life and partly to do with life management. Here goes...<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may already know some of these details. In the interest <br/>
of understanding I am sharing for a clearer picture of where I am <br/>
coming from. Details...<br/>
<br/>
I have seven children, five step and two biological. My oldest is <br/>
18 and starting Dorsey Business school. She, as well as the five <br/>
steps, were/are public schooled. They all, minus one of the 17-year-<br/>
old twins, live at home full time. Tabitha, Pat&#39;s oldest, is <br/>
starting Macomb in January. Tammi and Tracey are both at the local, <br/>
yuck, high school. They graduate this school year. Amie and <br/>
Andrew, Pat&#39;s two youngest, both attend at the local charter, also <br/>
yuck but better, school. Adrian, my youngest, is unschooled. He <br/>
has been since January of this year. Before that he was school at <br/>
homed, and before that public school for 2.5 years, and before that <br/>
school at homed. <br/>
<br/>
We used to be in business for ourselves. He closed the shop in the <br/>
interest of destressing and just pulling a check every week. Pat is <br/>
a transmission mechanic. It&#39;s not too promising where he is <br/>
employed right now. (He hasn&#39;t been paid in four weeks.) He&#39;s in <br/>
the process of opening our shop back up. This means long hours and <br/>
very late nights. Topping this off, my dad is dying of breast <br/>
cancer. My step-sister and myself are sharing the responsibility of <br/>
caring for him, that is as long as she&#39;s not employed. She&#39;s <br/>
currently looking for a job. This is taking up at least four days <br/>
of my week. Relying on the teens is difficut, and caring for the <br/>
younger ones is demanding. Our unschooling life was already being <br/>
interrupted throughout the day in relation to the public school <br/>
schedule. It&#39;s like adding a part-time job to an already very <br/>
demanding lifestlye.<br/>
<br/>
Adrian is 10 years old. He is what I believe to be a Highly <br/>
Sensitive Child. He would be considered introverted, but outspoken, <br/>
by many. He spends the majority of his time playing PS2 and <br/>
strategy games on the PC. He enjoys Adult Swim and gross cartoons <br/>
on the PC. :) It&#39;s his desire to be a video game designer and <br/>
critic. He&#39;s definately a &quot;boy&quot; when it comes to the outdoors. He <br/>
loves BB and pellet guns. His souvenir from Wisconsin was a new CO2 <br/>
gun purchased with his own money. The highlight for him for the <br/>
trip was seeing a mother bear and her cub in my step-sister&#39;s <br/>
yard/woods. His favorite place to be is my grandparent&#39;s farm, not <br/>
our very tiny city lot at home. He really doesn&#39;t have any <br/>
friends. Also, something else that I try to not let bother me.<br/>
<br/>
My concern is this. I have a signifigant other that can&#39;t help me <br/>
with much of anything due to his personal schedule and life <br/>
demands. Getting the teens to help is work in itself. Most <br/>
importantly, to me, is my unschooled son. Should I be worried about <br/>
this? What have you done in this type of uncontrolable and <br/>
temporary situation? How did you make it through? What do you <br/>
think you would do, or how do you think you would handle it? Do I <br/>
need to just chill and not worry about it? I welcome all wisdom, <br/>
tried or not.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for reading this far...<br/>
<br/>
Tina<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;wife Jane, who is 27 years old. We have a 2-week-old daughter named <br/>
Bree. We are strongly considering home schooling/unschooling for <br/>
many, widely varied, reasons. Since she is so young, we&#39;d like to be <br/>
able to &quot;get our ducks in a row&quot; before she is &quot;supposed&quot; to start <br/>
school, and to ensure that we don&#39;t make fatal errors in judgment <br/>
that will cause later problems.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi Jeff, welcome and congratulations.<br/>
<br/>
I would heartily endorse everything that Millie said, and I just want to<br/>
pass on a couple of website addresses. Just breathe and relax. You have time<br/>
to do all this reading. <br/>
<br/>
The main key is just watching your wondrous dd and staying in the moment,<br/>
letting go of any agendas, and avoiding (if you can) getting caught up in<br/>
looking for future outcomes. Most parents, especially ones who have made<br/>
their way here, don&#39;t usually make &quot;fatal errors in judgment&quot;, just ordinary<br/>
human errors and an apology and striving to do better next time work<br/>
wonders. Children are so forgiving and wise. They show us what they need if<br/>
we only listen and watch.<br/>
<br/>
For some general attachment/mindful parenting concepts:<br/>
www.naturalchild.org (lots of short articles that might appeal to dw)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Aware Baby&quot; by Aletha Solter is a book that may stretch your concept of<br/>
what a baby is mentally or emotionally capable of communicating,<br/>
particularly the concept of different types of crying.<br/>

&quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; by Alfie Kohn ( www.alfiekohn.org ) <br/>
&quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot; and others by John Taylor Gatto - especially good to rock<br/>

Thanks everyone for the suggestions. I have been saving eggcartons <br/>

they work great. I loved the lakeshore learning site. I think I&#39;m <br/>
going to put in an order with them for paints by the jug, which will <br/>
by an investment but save money in the long run. I also think someone <br/>

Thanks for your reply, Ren.<br/>

Grades and achievement don&#39;t really matter much to me. I was a &quot;B&quot; <br/>
student all through school while rarely cracking a book, and NEVER <br/>
doing homework. All I worry about in this regard is her future vis-a-<br/>
vis the rest of society. After all, homeschoolers/unschoolers do not <br/>
live in a vaccuum. Do we just &quot;pick&quot; a &quot;grade&quot; she is in based on <br/>
her age? As to the government, I have no problem with fudging <br/>
their &quot;required&quot; documentation. In my state, all they require is a <br/>
yearly intent letter, and monthly attendence records. The rest is <br/>
stuff we are required to do/keep on file at home.<br/>
<br/>
My wife and I have a very active lifestyle, with numerous and widely <br/>
varied interests. I am positive that there is ample opportunity <br/>
therein for my daughter to learn and grow. She will have mountain of <br/>
reading materials, and a computer, and video games if she likes <br/>
them. As to computer use, should I make a typing tutor program <br/>
available, our wait until she asks for one?<br/>
<br/>
As to the in-laws, I have already planted the homeschooling seed. <br/>
They weren&#39;t really thrilled with the prospect, but seemed to <br/>
understand my reasoning. The unschooling model.... ????<br/>
<br/>
As to the thick skin, I grew one long ago - I have never really <br/>
cared what other people think of me. My wife, OTOH, is a people <br/>
pleaser and has real difficulty in defending herself and her <br/>
choices. Maybe she&#39;ll learn a new skill as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Jeff,<br/>
it was interesting following this thread. You are certainly on the ball <br/>
with your research. My dd was 5yo before I got into it.<br/>
I did notice some comments from you that made me react. The above is <br/>
one, another one was on your wife not wanting to read much and your <br/>
wife maybe learning that learning can be fun. My impression is from <br/>
these that you are dissatisfied with your wife&#39;s choices and way of <br/>
behaving in some circumstances.<br/>
the bit on unschooling that I have picked up seems to say that we <br/>
should learn to accept our children the way they are. To accept them <br/>
completely also means accepting if they don&#39;t do the super things, the <br/>
reading, the learning the way we&#39;d like them to, doesn&#39;t it? Now I&#39;m <br/>
not saying that I&#39;m neccesarily very good at these things (yet). But <br/>
if we agree with this statement, should we not also extent the same <br/>
acceptance and freedom to other people, e.g. your wife?<br/>
I am the type of person that reads all the time and needs a lot of <br/>
research and feed back until I settle comfortably on something. I tend <br/>
to look into things deeply and mull over things and I waver for quite a <br/>
while until I&#39;m settled. It is sometimes not so easy to &#39;defend one&#39;s <br/>
choices&#39; when oneself still feels new and raw at something. I often <br/>
have no problem with things in theory, but the practice and reality <br/>
often give me more to chew. What I&#39;m trying to say is: maybe just <br/>
accept that your wife is different. That it is not &#39;better&#39; to read <br/>
lots, just that you are reading lots and your wife doesn&#39;t. You are <br/>
different that&#39;s all. You have strength and she has different <br/>
strengths.E.g. I read lots and my girl friend doesn&#39;t read and never <br/>
has, apart may be form the occasional cook book :-) She runs a <br/>
successful horse tracking business and is on the go from dawn to dusk. <br/>
So far she hasn&#39;t felt the need for extended reading and I have to <br/>
admit she is doing fine, having a lot of fun. Whereas I&#39;m trying to get <br/>
my head around my 14yo dd freedom to not help with house hold chores. <br/>
Not so much fun so far :-)<br/>
You never know, your baby might take after your wife ???<br/>

<br/>
***Since she is so young, we&#39;d like to be <br/>
able to &quot;get our ducks in a row&quot; before she is &quot;supposed&quot; to start <br/>
school, and to ensure that we don&#39;t make fatal errors in judgment <br/>
that will cause later problems.***<br/>
<br/>
Everything seems so urgent when you have a brand new baby. Your sense<br/>
of responsibility is overwhelmed with the realization there is a life<br/>
depending on the decisions you make. I felt just like you when my son<br/>
Dylan was born. It seems like there isn&#39;t enough time to get everything<br/>
right. <br/>
<br/>
The good news is you do have time. The bad news is you won&#39;t get<br/>
everything right. But even the bad news isn&#39;t all bad because in your<br/>
mistakes you&#39;ll be learning something about yourself and your daughter<br/>
and you&#39;ll do better the next time. So my first advice to you is to<br/>
relax and enjoy your new baby. <br/>
<br/>
***First, where does one start?***<br/>
<br/>
Start by assuming everything is all right. Trust your daughter as a<br/>
human being will want to do what humans do. Be loving, generous with<br/>
your time, be willing to participate in her world. Accept that she is<br/>
and will be her own person and doesn&#39;t need to be shaped or molded by you<br/>
or society. <br/>
<br/>
***How do we &quot;teach&quot; the basic fundamentals? By that I mean,<br/>
beyond-bedtime-story reading, spelling, writing, and <br/>
basic arithmetic. ***<br/>
<br/>
You can &quot;teach&quot; them any way you want to but that doesn&#39;t mean she will<br/>
learn what you&#39;re teaching. If you want to know how to &quot;teach&quot; there<br/>
are teaching resources galore. I hope you don&#39;t &quot;teach.&quot; I hope you let<br/>
her learn. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to know how your daughter will learn, that&#39;s something she<br/>
will show you. She will learn to read by being read to, by having access<br/>
to books and the freedom to explore. She&#39;ll learn by experimenting with<br/>
writing - she&#39;ll write jumbles of letters and be pleased about what she&#39;s<br/>
done. She&#39;ll pretend to read and be very satisfied. She&#39;ll start to<br/>
recognize letters and remember where she saw them before and when the<br/>
time is right for her it will all come together and she&#39;ll begin to read.<br/>
It might take a month or it might take twelve years. But because she<br/>
lives with people who read, in a world where written language is<br/>
everywhere, she&#39;ll learn. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll write when she has a reason to and she&#39;ll spell well or poorly<br/>
according to her nature. Enough people had trouble spelling well that we<br/>
now have spell check and other wondrous things to help us communicate<br/>
better. (Like telephones! No spelling!)<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll learn about math when she wants to buy toys, keep score in a game<br/>
or divide cookies fairly among friends. If she finds math interesting<br/>
she&#39;ll look for ways to learn more about it. If she doesn&#39;t, maybe her<br/>
talents will be for other things. <br/>
<br/>
***My state requires a yearly written assessment of <br/>
Reading, Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies, and <br/>
standardized testing every three years starting at the end of third <br/>
grade. How does the unschooling model conform to these <br/>
requirements?***<br/>
<br/>
My state doesn&#39;t require testing but if you can find other unschoolers in<br/>
your area and talk with them I&#39;m sure they have strategies.<br/>
My state doesn&#39;t require yearly assessments either but I could easily<br/>
write about what Dylan has done. I have a huge calendar and because I<br/>
have a mind like a steel sieve, I write everything down. So my calendar<br/>
has the dates we went to the punkin&#39; chunkin, and the dog show and the<br/>
symphony. I have notations about hikes and fossil hunting expeditions and<br/>
museum visits and art gallery tours and clay classes and martial arts<br/>
tournaments, and ... Life won&#39;t let you down. You&#39;ll find your<br/>
assessment material. <br/>
<br/>
***What do we say to Jane&#39;s parents when they pitch the inevitable fit?<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bye!&quot; You can tell them you&#39;re considering homeschooling. You can<br/>
tell them you&#39;re going to see how it goes. You can tell them Bree can go<br/>
to school if she wants to. The less you talk to them about your<br/>
personal decisions the fewer fits they can pitch. She&#39;s not their child<br/>
and it&#39;s not their place to make decisions about your family. You are<br/>
not required by law to let them fling the poo of negativity on you. <br/>
<br/>
We said &quot;Dylan doesn&#39;t want to go to kindergarten.&quot; That was ok with the<br/>
family members who were living near us because they could see he was<br/>
happy and bright and not missing anything. Compulsory school age is<br/>
seven here, so they weren&#39;t in panic mode yet. When he was six we said<br/>
&quot;He doesn&#39;t want to go to school.&quot; That was still ok with the closer<br/>
relatives because he wasn&#39;t compulsory school age. Family members who<br/>
lived elsewhere started to get nervous though. At seven he didn&#39;t want<br/>
to go to school so we finally said &quot;homeschool.&quot; Those who saw Dylan<br/>
everyday were ok with it because they knew we were busy doing all kinds<br/>
of things and most of them were smart enough to realize he&#39;d never be<br/>
doing those things if he was stuck at school. This was when I started<br/>
getting letters from concerned relatives who did not live near us. They<br/>
started sending articles about education. <br/>
<br/>
It was a hassle for awhile but as Dylan got older those who would compare<br/>
him with their schooled children found a kid who was smart, interested,<br/>
thoughtful and engaged. Dylan himself became the reassurance they<br/>
needed. It will be that way with your daughter too. <br/>
<br/>
***If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, <br/>
how do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>
achievement?***<br/>
<br/>
Philosophically grades don&#39;t matter, they mean nothing to a life long,<br/>
natural learner. I hope you can really think about this. A grade is a<br/>
judgement about another persons learning and it has never and can never<br/>
help anyone learn anything real. Grades (and tests) are dangerous and<br/>
spirt crushing. <br/>
<br/>
But since your state requires testing, and if you intend to comply with<br/>
the law, ask other unschoolers how they&#39;ve done it. <br/>
<br/>
Some places let you pick the test and the test results don&#39;t matter. <br/>
They don&#39;t have any bearing, according to the law, on whether you can<br/>
continue to keep her out of school. <br/>
<br/>
Some people join umbrella schools that can help unschoolers with testing<br/>
requirements. <br/>
<br/>
I have read different things. Someone once said their child magically<br/>
&quot;skipped&quot; those grades where testing was required. So for two years she<br/>
was in &quot;second grade&quot; and then she &quot;jumped ahead&quot; to fourth. <br/>
<br/>
If you are opposed to the concept of testing in general you could move to<br/>
a state that doesn&#39;t require testing. <br/>

<br/>
I disagree. As adults, we CHOSE to have children, they didn&#39;t choose <br/>
their parents. If we want to provide a very nurturing, interesting <br/>
environment, it certainly helps to look at the qualities in your <br/>
mate that may hinder the process.<br/>
This doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t accepting where they are, it means there <br/>
needs to be some dialogue about how to avoid passing our own damage <br/>
and hang ups on to our free children.<br/>
<br/>
If I had simply &quot;accepted&quot; my dh where he was, I wouldn&#39;t have the <br/>
unschooling supportive partner I have today. I was unwilling to go <br/>
along with his ideas, I was NOT willing to just accept where he was <br/>
and I let him know. Because I was unwilling to back down about how <br/>
we would treat the children (I told him he could continue to do the <br/>
damage, but I would NOT be party to it) things changed.<br/>
<br/>
There was a level of acceptance as far as my not being able to <br/>
change him, his own changes had to happen in their own time. But I <br/>
certainly was not aiding and abetting.<br/>
<br/>
I got the impression that Jeff is completely accepting of where his <br/>
wife is, but also aware of the things that could be a problem in an <br/>
unschooling household. His wife sounds like someone that was <br/>
INCREDIBLY hurt by the school system and could benefit from all the <br/>
healing power of unschooling. I have NO doubt she will find many <br/>
wounds healed through unschooling her own child, as many of us here <br/>
did.<br/>
I don&#39;t think being aware of unschooling blockages or potential <br/>
problems means we don&#39;t accept our partners for who they are. It <br/>
does mean you need to find ways to help that partner avoid passing <br/>
the wound on to their child.<br/>

Dear Jeff,<br/>
I only have a second but couldn&#39;t resist commenting that I think you two are<br/>
off to a great start. It seems like you both have the same goals for your<br/>
family and your Type A personality can get the ball rolling with reading,<br/>
research and asking questions but you&#39;ll probably find that your wife&#39;s more<br/>
laid back nature will prove out that as Bree grows and learns and *is* most<br/>
things really will &quot;take care of themselves&quot; as you said. My bit of advise<br/>
is to read some unschooling websites and lists like this one. Let that lead<br/>
you to books that strike your fancy and also try to get to know some local<br/>
families who are doing it. There&#39;s nothing like relationships with other<br/>
unschoolers. Our play group has families who&#39;s children are not &quot;school<br/>
age&quot; and we don&#39;t think that&#39;s strange at all. Also attachment parenting<br/>
resources may be helpful to you at this stage in your lives.<br/>
<br/>
You have years before you have to be concerned about your state&#39;s laws -<br/>
really. And by that time they very may well have changed. If it makes you<br/>
feel better you can look up what you need to know on www.nhen.org but I<br/>
truly wouldn&#39;t waste time on it now. Bree&#39;s babyhood will be over in the<br/>
blink of an eye and I urge you not to waste a minute away from her on the<br/>
legalities of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Avoid declaring your unschooling status to people who might object (MIL, DS<br/>
etc.) after all, By the time they start asking about little Bree&#39;s schooling<br/>
years will have passed. Why have those arguments early?<br/>
<br/>
FWIW My family took a detour from our AP, unscooly beginnings to send two of<br/>
our children to a first rate Montessori school and we regret doing that a<br/>
lot. It was way better in some respects than traditional school but still<br/>
not even close to as good as we have it now with all af them unschooled. It<br/>
was a detour I avoided with my third child.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, relax, enjoy the baby, read Holt cause you&#39;ll find him interesting<br/>
(not as a how-to but just cuz *you* will enjoy it.) Love hug kiss live but<br/>
don&#39;t try to &quot;teach fundamentals&quot; Bree will stun you with her ability to<br/>
learn what she needs to know - always. OK I was supposed to be quick.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They will teach themselves this stuff when they&#39;re ready. A child in <br/>
a home where books are joyfully read will want to read, just as a <br/>
baby in a house where people speak will want to speak. A child in a <br/>
home where arithmetic is used, whether it be for cooking or <br/>
calculating the total on a shopping list or the angle for a new <br/>
cabinet, will want to know how it all works. They&#39;ll pick it up in <br/>
drips and drabs and before you know it, they can do it. You&#39;ll see as <br/>
your daughter learns and grows that there&#39;s very rarely a moment when <br/>
something is learned or not learned. It&#39;s all a continuum. A baby <br/>
babbles and learns to make noises with their mouth - are they <br/>
talking? Then they repeat a sound that they know makes a <br/>
word &quot;mamamamamama&quot; - is this talking? One day they point to <br/>
something and say a real word (my daughter&#39;s was &quot;duck!&quot; after which <br/>
she called all birds ducks :-) - but is this talking? They add more <br/>
and more and more words to their vocabulary and one day they string 2 <br/>
words together &quot;me milk!&quot;. Eventually they talk in complete sentences <br/>
but with limited vocabulary, and at some point you realize that their <br/>
vocabulary is the equivalent of an adults. At what point on this <br/>
continuum are they actually &quot;talking&quot;? Every step along the way is a <br/>
part of the learning, and all of it is exciting to watch and be a <br/>
part of and encourage. Right now, my daughter is sounding out every <br/>
word she sees, from cereal boxes to book covers. She&#39;s in that <br/>
process with reading and it&#39;s exciting to watch too. Some day, before <br/>
I know it, she&#39;ll be picking up books and reading them, and I won&#39;t <br/>
exactly be able to put my finger on the moment that she &quot;learned to <br/>
read&quot;.<br/>

grade assessment next year and we&#39;re not worried about it. Though we <br/>
haven&#39;t sat down and done any kind of lessons, he can read, write, <br/>
and do &#39;rithmatic, he&#39;s just picked it up along the way. I can&#39;t <br/>
speak to the yearly assessment as our state doesn&#39;t have that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What do we say to Jane&#39;s parents when they pitch the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I wouldn&#39;t say anything for at least a few years. There&#39;s just <br/>
not much point if you know someone is going to be antagonistic about <br/>
it. At 5 or 6 years, or even 7 (which is the compulsory attendance <br/>
age in our state), you can just say that you&#39;re homeschooling. By <br/>
then, I&#39;m betting there will be even millions more homeschoolers than <br/>
there are now, and already it&#39;s not such an unusual thing. My mom (a <br/>
former educator) was fairly opposed at the first, but I always like <br/>
to say &quot;the proof is in the pudding&quot;. Very few people, when they meet <br/>
our interesting, engaging, and exuberant kids, could have any <br/>
objections to the way we&#39;re choose to unschool them. My parents <br/>
definitely don&#39;t have any objections any more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, <br/>
&gt; how do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can choose to decide however it will benefit her the best. In our <br/>
case, we chose the latest grade that we could, because it would delay <br/>
the year that our kids will be tested. Our son is on the cusp between <br/>
two school years, and we chose the earlier one (so right now, he&#39;s <br/>
officially in &quot;2nd grade&quot;). For a local homeschool resource center, <br/>
we might choose 3rd grade if he wants to get into a particular class <br/>
(he&#39;s very into robotics right now, for instance, and the robotics <br/>
classes they offer are for older kids).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our goal is a healthy, happy, well-adjusted daughter, unlimited in <br/>
&gt; her future prospects - while keeping Mom and Dad out of jail for <br/>
&gt; failing to follow the rules. Any advice, resources, etc. that you <br/>
&gt; folks can recommend would be gratefully received.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about jail. I know at least that in <br/>
our state if you&#39;re out of compliance with the homeschool rules, they <br/>
send you a letter and you just have to get *in* compliance. I think <br/>
the worst thing that could happen would be that they would mandate <br/>
your child has to go to school. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got many years before you have to worry about any of the legal <br/>
aspects - probably at least 6 or 7. Right now, I&#39;d just concentrate <br/>
on living in the moment, enjoying your daughter, and watching her <br/>
live and learn. Actually, that&#39;s great advice for the next couple of <br/>
decades!<br/>

Your daughter will be a better and happier person if she grows up to<br/>
believe she is just as she should be. Comparisons hurt. People learn<br/>
what they need to learn to live and be happy. What you need might not be<br/>
what I need. What your daughter needs might not be what little Sally Sue<br/>
needs. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***After all, homeschoolers/unschoolers do not <br/>
live in a vaccuum. Do we just &quot;pick&quot; a &quot;grade&quot; she is in based on <br/>
her age? ***<br/>
<br/>
Grades are a vacuum. They suck at you until you feel either superior to<br/>
others or desperately inadequate. They suck at parents until they change<br/>
the way a parent sees a child, either as full of potential (which is<br/>
unfair and creates pressure) or as lacking, in need of repair. Please<br/>
don&#39;t do this to your daughter. <br/>
<br/>
She has the chance to grow up never being judged as &quot;ahead&quot; or &quot;behind&quot;. <br/>
She can be a person living her life without the emotional stress of<br/>
arbitrary assessments from others. <br/>
<br/>
And since unschoolers don&#39;t live in a vacuum she will have a much more<br/>
fun filled and interesting life than the tested and graded 8:00 AM to<br/>
3:00 PM schooled kids who have two hours of homework every night. How do<br/>
you grade another person&#39;s life? What right do you have to even want<br/>
to? <br/>
<br/>
***My wife, OTOH, is a people pleaser and has real difficulty in<br/>
defending herself and her <br/>
choices. ***<br/>
<br/>
It can be hard. When people make judgements about the most important<br/>
things in our lives, it hurts. If her family gives her a D minus in<br/>
parenting how will you comfort her? <br/>

<br/>
***Most importantly, to me, is my unschooled son. Should I be worried<br/>
about <br/>
this? What have you done in this type of uncontrolable and <br/>
temporary situation?***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry about your dad. <br/>
<br/>
My dad died of bone cancer four years ago when my son Dylan was eight. <br/>
We took care of him at home. It&#39;s such an emotionally exhausting time. <br/>
<br/>
Take comfort that your son loves video games and enjoys his time playing.<br/>
It is so wonderful that he has something to do when you can&#39;t be right<br/>
there with him. <br/>
<br/>
Talk to him. Make sure he knows things will be different - you *will*<br/>
have more time one day. As you said this is a temporary situation. <br/>
Maybe even make plans for a special trip. Let both of you have something<br/>
positive to focus on. <br/>
<br/>
When you have a few free hours do something different. Take him out to<br/>
lunch. Go to the park and throw a Frisbee around. Wander around the<br/>
book store, test drive Jeeps, go to the shooting range. <br/>
<br/>
Your life and your son&#39;s life will move forward from this point, even<br/>
though it doesn&#39;t feel that way now. Things will be ok. But make every<br/>
effort to make the time you do spend with your son as positive as it can<br/>
be. Even if you&#39;re just sitting beside him while he plays a game.<br/>
<br/>
***Getting the teens to help is work in itself. ***<br/>
<br/>
Help like, around the house? Could you hire a neighborhood teen or<br/>
someone to come in and help out? I know it would be an expense but now<br/>
when you&#39;re so stressed and worn out it would be a much more peaceful and<br/>
effective solution than trying to get people to help who don&#39;t really<br/>
want to. You really don&#39;t need the added stress of a domestic power<br/>
struggle. Do what you can to avoid that. Is there a homeschooler you<br/>
know who would tidy up for you in exchange for something? <br/>
<br/>
Ask more from your partner. These are special circumstances and he *can*<br/>
give a little more, temporarily. Wouldn&#39;t you be willing to do the same<br/>
for him? Let him know what you need. My own husband felt really lost<br/>
when we were taking care of my dad. He really didn&#39;t know what would<br/>
help me the most. It helped him (and me!) a lot when I just told him<br/>
what I wanted him to do. <br/>
<br/>
And remember some of household stuff probably isn&#39;t as important to your<br/>
family members as it is to you. Talk to them about it, I&#39;ll bet they<br/>
really don&#39;t care if dishes sit a few days. Let them sit if you can&#39;t<br/>
get to them. Maybe even switch to paper plates and plastic disposable<br/>
bowls and plastic utensils. Do whatever it takes to make your load<br/>
lighter. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep thinking. Write me off list if you want. I&#39;m so sorry for<br/>
what you&#39;re going through, but it will change. <br/>

check the laws. I know that Rhode Island superintendents have a lot <br/>
of latitude BUT there is a limit they cannot cross in what they <br/>
require - and weekly summaries of what you are covering, I believe, <br/>
crosses that line.</div>
