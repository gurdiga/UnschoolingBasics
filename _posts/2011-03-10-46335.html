<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887448899">Hello Andrea,<br/>
Below is an extensive list of books, periodicals, and websites that Kelly Lovejoy sent me a few years ago. I hope it isn&#39;t overwhelming to you. I personally found it to be helpful. <br/>
The first book I read, which I found to be helpful in becoming a more peaceful parent, was Alfie Kohn&#39;s, &quot;Unconditional Parenting.&quot; I also enjoyed, &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; and &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook.&quot;<br/>
Best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-912410777">My words of reassurance would be to say that your questions are all a part of the process of learning and trusting your children and yourself with unschooling. We went through periods of questioning and doubting, sometimes still do, although less so now. Continue to bring your questions and doubts here or to an unschooling conference to get answers and guidance. My questions and doubts helped me to delve deeper into learning more about unschooling and to let go of my fears.<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Sharon<br/>

All of your questions are fairly typical. The links that have been suggested should address them. That is if you are looking for information about unschooling. Which is one way to approach homeschooling, one way to live as a homeschooler. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Never mind, indeed! Let&#39;s keep the topic on unschooling, please. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll take this opportunity to note that people come to unschooling for all sorts of reasons and with all sorts of beliefs and lifestyles - we&#39;re not a homogenous group by any stretch of the imagination, which is why the moderators here are sometimes pushy when the subject starts to drift. Sometimes folks do come to unschooling with the assumption that everyone&#39;s on the same page about Xyz (politics, health, and &quot;the mainstream&quot; are three biggies) and its not so. Unschooling is what we have in common - and sometimes that&#39;s about it! <br/>

unschooling, the first time I read it I saw it as pointing out that the two <br/>
ideas are not dissimilar.  The way you deal with illness (choosing modern <br/>
medicine or homeopathics etc, whichever way you believe) can have long term <br/>
effects just as much as choosing schooling or unschooling.  I wonder why the <br/>
original poster sees unschooling as a more difficult choice to make than <br/>
what style of medication to choose for her child?  I would have seen health <br/>
issues are more serious (and thus harder to go against the norm) than <br/>
educational issues.</div>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll take this opportunity to note that people come to unschooling for all sorts of reasons and with all sorts of beliefs and lifestyles - we&#39;re not a homogenous group by any stretch of the imagination, which is why the moderators here are sometimes pushy when the subject starts to drift. Sometimes folks do come to unschooling with the assumption that everyone&#39;s on the same page about Xyz (politics, health, and &quot;the mainstream&quot; are three biggies) and its not so. Unschooling is what we have in common - and sometimes that&#39;s about it! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029915948">Sharon, Thank you for this list of resources. I know that it will be very useful to me. I see that Naomi Aldort&#39;s book is on there. I have enjoyed her teachings. Thinking about doing a phone session with her but I am not sure I want to spend the money. I think it would be helpful though. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Andrea <br/>

Hello Andrea, <br/>
Below is an extensive list of books, periodicals, and websites that Kelly Lovejoy sent me a few years ago. I hope it isn&#39;t overwhelming to you. I personally found it to be helpful. <br/>
The first book I read, which I found to be helpful in becoming a more peaceful parent, was Alfie Kohn&#39;s, &quot;Unconditional Parenting.&quot; I also enjoyed, &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; and &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook.&quot; <br/>
Best, <br/>
Sharon <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-903691257">Well, I did see it that way and that&#39;s why I snapped. <br/>
<br/>
I also saw it as insulting to ask unschoolers if we think homeschooling (still not sure if the original poster was asking about unschooling) will harm our children. As if we haven&#39;t given this careful consideration. Of course, it is possible to give something careful consideration and read all sorts of information supporting the ideas you want to believe and still be wrong. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose it also rubs me the wrong way to be considered on the menu of out-of-the-mainstream choices. We&#39;ve been doing this so long and it has been going so well, it just doesn&#39;t feel like any sort of rebellion. And I don&#39;t have to fit into some category of vegetarian, alternative medicine, wanna-be hippie, ________ (fill in the blank with your favorite stereotype on the left) and rebel against everything else that&#39;s mainstream in order to unschool. <br/>
<br/>
And, in fact, we don&#39;t. I&#39;m off to drop one child at the charter school and take the other to the cardiologist this morning. <br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s no excuse for being snappish at a newbie. That&#39;s way too much for her to have considered when posting.<br/>
