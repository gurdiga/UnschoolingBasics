<br/>
I saw your message on New England Unschooling (or was<br/>
it some other list?) also. Just didn&#39;t have a chance<br/>
to reply. We&#39;re in Lowell. I&#39;ve a 8 yr old daughter<br/>

home with the kids. Correction, he&#39;s out and about<br/>

I second Jann&#39;s suggestion of joining the MHLA list<br/>
for sorting out the law and stuff. I also recommend<br/>
joining Merrimack Valley Home Learners. I&#39;ll find the<br/>
contact information and send it to you later. MVHL has<br/>
park days in summer and that was an excellent way for<br/>
us to get to know other homeschoolers. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063241645">I&#39;m familiar with the idea of unschooling but am trying to figure out <br/>
if this is a realistic fit for our household.  When I&#39;ve read about it, <br/>
it sounds appealing.. much more low-key in some ways, yet challenging <br/>
in others, i.e. a more gentle, less controlling parenting style.<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be like my parents... so I was enjoying the post about <br/>
stopping that recording in our heads.  However, I don&#39;t want a house <br/>
run by mostly my 3 year old dd.  *laughing*  She&#39;s a very spirited <br/>
soul. 5 1/2 year old ds has been so mellow and agreeable to this point <br/>
that dd has really thrown us off.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m rambling.  Sorry.  We have started only little bits <br/>
of &#39;school&#39; and by that I mean lots of reading and a bit of playing <br/>
with manipulatives for math.  Other than that, it&#39;s play, explore, some <br/>
tv, extracurricular activities and answering questions as they come.<br/>
<br/>
Any books or website suggestions to help me find my way would be <br/>
greatly appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018283717">Welcome, Tobye!<br/>
<br/>
Here is an excellent website, done so very well; organized and easy to<br/>
navigate.  I refer back to this site a bunch!<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Another &#39;easy to read in small bits&#39; book is called _Parenting a Free<br/>
Child:  An Unschooled Life_.  You can read more about that one here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Parenting-Free-Child-Unschooled-Life/dp/1411641558">http://www.amazon.com/Parenting-Free-Child-Unschooled-Life/dp/1411641558</a><br/>
<br/>
And on that same page, there are a couple of other EXCELLENT reads!  _The<br/>
Unschooling Handbook_ and _Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves_.<br/>
<br/>
Some of this reading will help you to see that your daughter&#39;s energy is not<br/>
to be feared.  It&#39;ll most likely help you to look at her through a different<br/>
lens, rather than the one that says she&#39;s &quot;running the house&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!  Keep reading here, too!  Such wonderful advice...<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Karen<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When Ray was younger, he was pretty intense. We were living <br/>
communally, with two other families with kids the same age as Ray, <br/>
but nowhere near as intense. For a long time we all struggled with <br/>
this idea that we didn&#39;t want one kid &quot;running&quot; the entire community. <br/>
Unfortunately, the idea backfired - intense kids have big needs, and <br/>
our fear of Ray &quot;running the show&quot; left us trying to downplay his <br/>
needs, which resulted in him &quot;amping up&quot; more often than not. Once my <br/>
partner and I started prioritizing Ray&#39;s needs we found his intensity <br/>
became less of an issue.<br/>
