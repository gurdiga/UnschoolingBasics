**** I think this is what I am trying to learn. It has recently struck me that I have a lot of expectations. <br/>

BTW, he made a great train track by himself today, for the first time. I am trusting the process. I am trusting the process. I am trusting the process... it is my new mantra.<br/>

One of the things that really needed to shift in my perception of trust is that even when i thought i was letting go of expectations there was more to be done in the area of true acceptance.  I used to say i trust my dd will eventual learn to read.  I *knew* it would happen, i *trusted* it would happen - had no expectation as to when.  And then a dear unschooling friend said to me, and what if she never does, what if she always finds reading difficult and independent reading never becomes a reality.  It was then that i understood real acceptance.  <br/>
