<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552423487">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to thank everyone (Joyce, Ren and Alex) for your advice, support and resources.  I truly appreciate your thoroughness and willingness to help me through this important and difficult process.  From reading your posts I am getting a better understanding of the bigger concepts involved with unschooling and how it works.  It really is a different way of thinking and looking at life and I love it!  I am still not 100% ready to jump into the unschooling abyss, but hope to be there by September.  I can&#39;t pull Anna out of school now since my husband isn&#39;t on board with this idea and I am getting resistance from extended family (not that they dictate what I do, but they do influence me).  Pulling her now would cause a lot of disagreement between me and my hubby so the lesser of the two evils is to keep her where she is for the remainder of the year and for me to continue to learn and make changes when and where I can so that by<br/>
 September we are all hopefully close to being on the same page and are able to work together to make this the amazing experience I know it can be.  Learning anything new is hard and scary no matter what the topic is.  I continue to learn as I go and am taking a hard look at myself and the things I personally need to change to make this successful.  I will continue to read your posts and post my questions as I am sure I will have more as I go through this journey.  Thank you for opening my eyes to the wonders of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
Jen    <br/>
