<div id="ygrps-yiv-247170192">Hi Everyone<br/>
I work with unschooling and passion-led families on their journeys and a<br/>
question has come up a few times lately and I don&#39;t have many experiences to<br/>
go off of for an answer...<br/>
<br/>
Something along the lines of &quot;I do want to stay more or less in the general<br/>
learning area for her age, if I can,  so that if she decides to go to public<br/>
school (which she might, at any time) the transition will be smooth.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if people could give input on fully unschooled children who<br/>
choose to try out public school - what have you seen happen?   From other<br/>
families i work with whose children have asked to try school here and there<br/>
- there has been a generally smooth transition, if the child is fully<br/>
wanting to be there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s like freeing a child from school to explore the world, but then  <br/>
limiting exploration to the school yard just incase they want to return.<br/>
<br/>
When people first start homeschooling, they picture homeschooling as  <br/>
absorbing what school offers but in different ways and on a different  <br/>
schedule. It&#39;s like school is at the center, contained in a building  <br/>
and textbooks, but homeschooling reaches beyond the building for  <br/>
better materials.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling throws away that model. It&#39;s living as though school  <br/>
didn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
School is like a diorama of the (supposed) important parts of the  <br/>
forest. Unschooling is the real forest for kids to explore in any  <br/>
direction and any order they want. They can focus on one area. They  <br/>
can dabble throughout the forest.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to unschool in the school yard, it would be better to  <br/>
see that as eclectic homeschooling. They would have much better advice.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants reassurance that unschooled kids can do fine in  <br/>
school, my daughter had no problems with the college math and one  <br/>
writing classes she took starting at 14. She said she had problems  <br/>
with arithmetic since she didn&#39;t have all the facts memorized but the  <br/>
rest of it she did fine on with basically only video games and real  <br/>
life math (and parents who talk about math occasionally). By the end  <br/>
of the first class she had practiced enough to get speedier at  <br/>
arithmetic.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the biggest reassurance is that it only takes weeks or months  <br/>
to catch on to what they need to know for the classroom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-13344479">I have seen my DD tackle school and do extremely well. It was entirely her choice. (It sure as hell wasn&#39;t mine! :) ) <br/>
<br/>
She took some 8th grade online courses to get comfortable with a schoolish routine and get an idea about subject content. Then she started high school with the 9th grade.<br/>
<br/>
She is looking to transfer to a more challenging/interesting charter school next year. When you have spent the better part of 15 years reading your way through the library, high school classes, even the honors classes she is in,have little or no new content.<br/>
<br/>
So her experience has been positive for what she wanted -- to have the experience and see what the social scene was like. But not great on the learning front. But she&#39;s working on that. :)<br/>
