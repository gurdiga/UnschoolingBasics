<div id="ygrps-yiv-505631952">Hey<br/>
<br/>
We are staying in London until the end of August and I was wondering if <br/>
anyone knew of RU families in the area or in the UK at all.  It would <br/>
be a great help as I would love to hook up with like minded people.  It <br/>
is so hard trying to explain RU to people and to be honest I just can&#39;t <br/>
be bothered to do so.  Please let me know of any contacts which may be <br/>
usefull.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-870302260">Thanks for the info - we were involved with Education Otherwise EO, <br/>
when we lived in the UK before. It is a very helpful organisation for <br/>
understanding the legalities of homeschooling in the UK - also a good <br/>
place for adult resources/books. I will look up the links you gave me <br/>
and if you are ever in london - let me know.  Please forgive my <br/>
ignorance, but how far is Norfolk from London?  I have never <br/>
understood the distance thing in the UK having come from the states, <br/>
if that makes sensse<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078622527">As a child of the midwest having 100 miles take 3 to 4 hours to drive doesn&#39;t compute either. And that is about the distance. However, the last time we drove from Norfolk to London it took 8 hours and we missed our flight to the U.S. So, driving times can vary. <br/>
