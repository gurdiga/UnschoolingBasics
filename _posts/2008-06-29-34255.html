<div id="ygrps-yiv-693554379">How old are your other kids... younger or older?<br/>
<br/>
Labeling a child&#39;s behavior as nonsensical is part of the reason it&#39;s hard<br/>
to deal with.  Can you think of anything fun you like to do for &quot;no<br/>
reason?&quot;  Maybe it just looked like fun.<br/>
<br/>
How often are you able to be with him and explore things together?  Here are<br/>
some ideas:<br/>
<br/>
*Have large pieces of paper handy for painting on or a wall devoted to it<br/>
could help cut down some on the extra cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
*Find a place to help him dump the ashes because eventually you&#39;re going to<br/>
do that anyway right?  If he has seen you do it already, he might simply be<br/>
mimicking you.  Kids are supposed to imitate their parents so they can learn<br/>
how the world works and what part they have in it.<br/>
<br/>
*Can the ski boots dry out or is water in them permanently damaging?  If he<br/>
has rainboots, he could probably safely fill those and you could laugh<br/>
together about filling silly rainboots with water.  Spending lots of time<br/>
together can fill *you* with how wonderful and inventive what he&#39;s doing<br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
With dad away or not, every age kid needs lots of time with you.  Just being<br/>
bodily in the same house is not enough.  I&#39;m thinking that if a child has<br/>
time to spread paint all over the dining room, he probably needs more time<br/>
with you.  Are you off cleaning or doing some other task while this is<br/>
happening?  Make sure he has something he&#39;s really into doing if you need a<br/>
second to do something.  But first spend time with him more, have fun and<br/>
make connections together.<br/>

<br/>
Could it be that he does these things without discussing them with <br/>
you first because he believes you&#39;ll say no? (And, I&#39;m not saying <br/>
that you would say &quot;no&quot;; I&#39;m really asking.)  What if he *knew* that <br/>
you wouldn&#39;t say no but instead would help him find a way to explore <br/>
the thing he wants to explore but in a what that was okay with <br/>
you.  For example, instead of saying &quot;no, you can&#39;t play with the <br/>
matches,&quot; saying, &quot;yes, let&#39;s go outside and do some fire experiments <br/>
together!&quot; or &quot;yes, let&#39;s spread this paper out and dump the paint <br/>
and see what happens.&quot;  He sounds wonderfully creative and <br/>
brilliant!  It just sounds like he needs you to help him find the <br/>
answers to these questions in a more acceptable way.  (You might want <br/>
to consider getting newsprint end rolls (the ends of rolls of <br/>
newsprint that are usually discarded) so you can have endless paper <br/>
available to him.)<br/>
<br/>
I know it sounds like it could be hard to do, but if you can shift <br/>
your focus from the mess he&#39;s creating and the clean up to helping <br/>
him explore and know the amazing benefits from supporting his <br/>
explorations, you&#39;ll feel less resistance and so will he.  He&#39;ll also <br/>
be able to be more open with you about the things he wants to do.  If <br/>
you&#39;re more fun to do them with, he&#39;ll be more liable to include you in them.<br/>

Julie, Seems like he has a lot of time to explore on his own.  Is he<br/>
the type of child who will sneak away to find things that interest him<br/>
or did he have enough free time without things to do that he created a<br/>
game?  <br/>
<br/>
At three, my son had too much time with grandma watching him one day<br/>
and he used the blue stamp pad as a body paint.  He looked like a<br/>
smurf for a few days.  Kids will do wacky things that you would never<br/>
anticipate if you give them the time and supplies.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s bored or just very curious or probably both.  I<br/>
try not to react with anger but I&#39;m often so frustrated with him and<br/>
the huge mess I need to clean up...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At 5 years old, I found that my kids wanted my interaction much more<br/>
than at 3 or 4 years old.  But it was different.  They needed me to<br/>
play their games, not play mine.  Let him lead.  Follow his direction.<br/>
 Let him explore his games and use your foresight to redirect the game<br/>
to a less messy clean-up zone.  <br/>
<br/>
Does he have a place to make a mess?  At 5, my son was making mud<br/>
patches in my backyard to bath in and covering himself from head to<br/>
toe.  Grass can regrow, the memories are priceless.  Take pictures of<br/>
the wacky moments.  You&#39;ll laugh later.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...I spend tons of time with him but it never seems to be enough...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Playing your games or his??  <br/>
<br/>
Is he learning to explore by his rules or are you supplying him with<br/>
all the information?  He will learn to be more thoughtful of his<br/>
surroundings and possessions if he&#39;s given the freedom to explore his<br/>
impulses (with guidance when necessary).  Be present.  Be observant. <br/>
Be excited to follow his lead. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have three kids and this year, I&#39;m on my own, as my dh is in<br/>
Iraq...which could also be another reason he is acting out...daddy&#39;s<br/>
gone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to hear that you are parenting alone, but it happens all<br/>
over the world everyday.  Military life was likely to result in your<br/>
needing to parent alone sometimes.  That was the deal that you signed<br/>
up for.  You can choose to wallow in it or you can choose to live<br/>
everyday to it&#39;s fullest and enjoy the moments you have.  Enjoy those<br/>
beautiful kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the quirkiness and wonderful unexpectedness that comes with<br/>
children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618697181">My 4.5 year old is just like this.  These are sensory-seeking behaviors-<br/>
they are looking for that sensory experience.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hate the label SPD (sensory processing disorder) and wont get her formally<br/>
tested or labeled, but it helped me to look at the check list and realize my<br/>
dd wasn&#39;t the only child who wanted to rub mud all over her body from head<br/>
to toe, or spill out the entire bottle of shampoo to rub it all over her<br/>
body and call herself a slimy slug, will play meticulously with playdoh for<br/>
an hour, screams and covers her ears at certain noises. etc etc.  She is<br/>
just a sensitive girl, and some kids are more sensitive than others, so I<br/>
don&#39;t agree with the tone on this website- like there is something &#39;wrong&#39;<br/>
with these children.   I did learn some of the activities listed on the<br/>
website that helped me to find creative ways to let her have those sensory<br/>
experiences she craved;<br/>

list.html<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I think this is just all apart of who my dd is, there is<br/>
nothing wrong with it.  My challenge is to make sure she has plenty of those<br/>
experiences for her to enjoy.     <br/>

saving your sanity -- the first being rebuild the trust and bond between you<br/>
and your son. BE on his team, BE the mama a kid like him would *love* to<br/>

under my testimonial :::bg:::)   I&#39;d also recommend the downloads from<br/>
unschooling conferences like the liveandlearnshop.com  When I need a nudge<br/>
(okay it&#39;s more like a full-blown a$$kicking) I listen to Jon Kream; other<br/>

change this sentence to &quot;Which would be another reason *I* am acting out...<br/>
daddy&#39;s gone&quot;<br/>
When Mitch died, I spent a lot of time in overwhelm, telling myself &quot;I can&#39;t<br/>
do this alone&quot; &quot;It sucks to do this alone&quot; &quot;I need him here to balance me&quot;<br/>
and lots and lots of untruths... I *CAN* do this alone; I *CAN* do this<br/>
JOYFULLY; My *kids* need ME here, fully and without past/future distractions<br/>
-- all feel *so* much better and are a happier place from which to look at<br/>
my relationship with my babies and where we want to go *together.*  When I<br/>
began speaking to mySelf in a more empowering way, I became a very empowered<br/>
mama. It&#39;s the old adage &quot;When mama ain&#39;t happy, ain&#39;t no body happy&quot; -- you<br/>
don&#39;t need to go anywhere to find your happiness and share it with your<br/>
family -- it&#39;s in abundant supply, you need only to tap into it to discover<br/>
it&#39;s all around you :)<br/>

Get so caught up in *his* moment of sharing that with you that you<br/>

will it help you bond with your child? How will it make messes not<br/>
happen? How does school lessen the daily stresses or make things<br/>
better? Just how does that happen?<br/>

I think if you really analyze it, you might find that school will<br/>
simply complicate your lives and add yet another stress.<br/>

each lifestyle comes with its own unique set of struggles.  But i<br/>
would not trade this for the world.  The struggles we dealt with with<br/>
the school system are soooo not worth the time and energy.  Yet, the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, yes there are... but they are all focused on separating kids from<br/>
parents, not connecting them.  They have plenty of resources for day<br/>
care, Mom&#39;s Night Out, stuff like that... if your child does ok with<br/>
day care and is up on ALL their shots.  I literally was required to<br/>
bring my children&#39;s shot records to every single meeting where they&#39;d<br/>
be present.  As if they are lepers.  My children are not vaccinated,<br/>
so that was a huge problem.<br/>
<br/>
I felt completely alone and unwanted when my husband was deployed... I<br/>
couldn&#39;t participate in any of the numerous activities and &quot;supports&quot;<br/>

Unschooling doesn&#39;t jive with military life.  (Big shock! LOL)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186099707">That&#39;s just awful. I can understand in a group management type situation<br/>
the whole vaccination situation (don&#39;t agree but can see the point from<br/>
their view) but I&#39;d think they would have resources available for<br/>
household assistance type things - someone to come help with the piles<br/>
of laundry so mom can care for the kids, that sort of thing. Mother&#39;s<br/>
helper type stuff. I was definitely not suggesting shipping the kids off<br/>
to a daycare but rather finding a friend to come over to play, a friend<br/>
who is old enough to assist and supervise the situation while mom cleans<br/>
the bathroom so that mom isn&#39;t having to try to do everything solo. Any<br/>
Girl Scout troops in the area - they&#39;re always looking for some kids to<br/>
care for to get their child care badges (or they already have them and<br/>
really like being with kids).<br/>

I am an Air Force Brat (and that term I use with pride).  I recommend you read a book called Military Brats: Legacies of Childhood Inside the Fortress by Mary Edwards Wertsch.  It gives great insight into _how_ military brats are different from the general population, and may help with understanding your children&#39;s views (did you grow up in the military?).<br/>
<br/>
Military life is hard on families.  Remember to take care of yourself so you can provide what your children need.<br/>
