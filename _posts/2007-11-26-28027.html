<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090734700">Hello Everyone!<br/>
I&#39;m Michelle and I&#39;m here to learn more about unschooling as an option <br/>
for my two children.  We&#39;ve been to private school, public school, home <br/>
school and presently we are doing charter school.  I truly enjoyed the <br/>
freedom of homeschool, but feared perhaps I wasn&#39;t doing enough.  So we <br/>
switched to charter school and none of us are very happy about the <br/>
sheer volumn of work.  To me it seems like a lot of it is wasted time <br/>
on information they don&#39;t need at this time and won&#39;t remember later on <br/>
when they may actually use it. I would love to hear how you came to <br/>
unschooling and what your experience has been.</div>
