wether to<br/>
do it or not?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would never enforce anything I think is harmful on my child!!<br/>
I would try to make home so interesting and fun that she wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
time for school.<br/>

   <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Ive been trying, honestly ! :) <br/>
  Our newest thing is she want to try horsebackriding lessons........so I found a lady who gives them for $15 a lesson and we go to try it out Tuesday! <br/>
   <br/>
  I think one of her main reasons for wanting to go to school is getting time away from her brother to be a &quot;normal&quot; kid. <br/>
  HE speands much of his day high pitched screaming, chewing on socks, and untill I finally just started keeping him in cut-off sleepers we were having a minimum of one incidences a day where he was smearing his poop on the walls. <br/>
  Between dad&#39;s crazy work schedule, one car and Nathaniel only being able to handle a limited number of outings I do what I can to get her time away and out with other friends , time away with just mom, etc but right now its not a lot :( <br/>
  She is also the type of kid that wants workbook type stuff to do everyday and as she states &quot; does not want mom to teach it to her&quot; .......I keep talking to her about how the seeds we planted is learning, so are the tadpoles we got, and the baloon helicopter we made, and so will the swimming and slip in slide we do in the summer and the critters we see on our walks and.........................................<br/>
  Her answer to this is that she can still do that stuff and go to school and she wants to go to school and have a &quot;real&quot; teacher teach her how to read. <br/>
  Sigh so I dont know. I feel like either shell go to school and just love it ...........or shell find out that first grade isnt nearly as much fun as k was and that they expect her to sit for very long periods of time and do work and on top of it homework. <br/>
   <br/>
  Speaking of homework ......does it seem to anyone else that hw is being assigned in much younger grades and more of it? The kids here in first grade get it everyday except friday . <br/>
  My mom said she was pretty sure I never got hw before second grade and then only once or twice a week and that it wasnt assigned daily untill 5th grade. ...hehe she says she remembers because I refused to do it :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>homework was a huge issue for our 8yr old daughter.  Almost two hours of homework in <br/>
second grade.  Most of it was busy work, and she had to read(what she called &quot;baby <br/>
books&quot;) for 15 min, out loud, and then put the book away.  Lil has been reading chapter <br/>
books on her own for at least a year, and the teacher told her they were too hard for her, <br/>
and sent a note home suggesting that i let lil choose her own books, which she had been.  <br/>
After being cooped up in the school for 8hrs, then 2 hrs on the bus, they expected the <br/>
kids to sit and do homework.  Sorry was a big issue for us, so glad we are done with it!!!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well it does sound like you&#39;re dealing with some extraordinary circumstances at home with your son. So if your daughter does end up going  to school and actually LOVING it...then great. She&#39;d be LOVING her days. That&#39;s a good thing. It would be filling a need for her. Your challenge will be to not get swept up in the school dogma and to just let her enjoy it on her own terms.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would be fine too obviously. Then she&#39;d want to come home and you could continue working out ways to make her unschooling days what she needs them to be.<br/>
<br/>
Qacei has asked to go to school at various times over the years. Each time I validated her feelings and explored her options. Only once did she end up actually going, usually it was just a passing thought. That was last Spring. She went for one week and decided it was more boring than fun or enlightening. She has not mentioned school positively since. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  lol......ok that teacher needs to be taken out and shot! :) <br/>
   <br/>
  I think Courtney dosent understand though and may just have to figure out on her own. She had a very laid back teacher in k...Mrs J usualy gave them homework once a week but really didnt care that much wether they did it or not ( she told me the reason she gave it at all was that she didnt want hw to be a completely foreign word when they got to first) she also didnt push reading down their throats. <br/>
   <br/>
  On the other hand her neighbor friend&#39;s teacher was sending home thees little phonics readers by the 4th week of school, giving homework twice a week and giving letter ( S,N,U ) grades on all of their papers!!<br/>
   <br/>
  She may end up with one of those teachers who are um ......really good at making children loathe school. <br/>
