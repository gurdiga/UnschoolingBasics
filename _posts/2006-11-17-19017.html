<div id="ygrps-yiv-444107208">Hi, <br/>
Thank you for your replies to my post, I appreciated and welcomed all <br/>
your thoughts. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I was feeling a bit insecure, I learn about so many things <br/>
people are doing to &quot;help&quot; their children, but I still don&#39;t get it. <br/>
Thought maybe it was me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy and realize I&#39;m lucky my son is basically happy and seems <br/>
well adjusted, I can&#39;t take the credit for it and hope that I&#39;m doing <br/>
right by him.<br/>
<br/>
It just seemed odd to me about all the issues my friend and I&#39;ve <br/>
heard others go though with their children. I wondered if it was <br/>
necessary and I was missing something. Although I admit I would never <br/>
ague with my son that way. ( I hope) (someone explain this to me) <br/>
<br/>
Thought maybe It&#39;d be nice to speak with someone else unschooling an <br/>
aspie, maybe gain some perspective. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, the argument that I spoke of earlier was over the child&#39;s <br/>
breakfast. She wanted banana pudding. ( seemed silly to me, dh <br/>
too...how does this become an issue?) <br/>
<br/>
Really just wanted a different take on things, wondered how others <br/>
unschooled their children with asperger&#39;s. DH and I are feeling a bit <br/>
alone, our thoughts on things seem so different then the ones around <br/>
us. The unschooling life fits us so well, but we really don&#39;t have  <br/>
people around that share our views. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thank you again for reading my post and taking the time to <br/>
reply. I hope all of you have a wonderful day.<br/>
<br/>
Maggie</div>

 </span></blockquote>Banana pudding?!?!?!?!  I&#39;m flabbergasted.  Did the mom take the time<br/>
to figure out that banana pudding would seem like a very logical<br/>
breakfast?  Bananas are high in potassium, vitamin C, fiber and have 2<br/>
g of protein.  Vanilla pudding is made with milk (calcium, iron,<br/>
protein) and then you have your nilla wafers which have more fiber and<br/>
the whole thing together has plenty of carbs to start a young person&#39;s<br/>
day off with a bang!<br/>
<br/>
Of course this is coming from someone who can justify ice cream for<br/>
breakfast!  LOL!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you are unschooling and parenting gently, then you probably won&#39;t <br/>
have many people that share your views, whether or not your child <br/>
has Asperger&#39;s.  Our lifestyle is definitely not mainstream!  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand that in the world of special needs, it is even more <br/>
emphasized that certain children need specific help from experts, <br/>
etc.  Schools get a lot of money for these special classes!  They <br/>
want you to think that you can&#39;t do it yourself.  But you don&#39;t have <br/>
to buy into that.<br/>
<br/>
There are certainly unschoolers with special needs who do use <br/>
classes, therapy, and/or medication.  It all depends on the child <br/>
and the need or problem.  But if your son is happy, I totally <br/>
wouldn&#39;t worry about it.  If there is ever a time when he isn&#39;t <br/>
happy anymore or is having a difficult time with some aspect of his <br/>
life, then I&#39;m sure you will do what you can to help him get what he <br/>
needs.<br/>

had seen what our family ate for breakfast this am, LOL.......my ds ate <br/>
a bowl of mashed potatoes with cheese, (his idea) My 3yr old ate an <br/>
apple, followed later by an egg, lol.....(mom was really bad.....coffee <br/>
and popcorn...don&#39;t tell......shhhhhhhhh) Don&#39;t worry, my kids usually <br/>
make up for it latter on their own. Belive or not they love veggies. :-)</div>

Or the Bill Cosby routine &quot;Dad is great! Gives us chocolate cake!&quot; The<br/>
kids ask for cake for breakfast and the dad in the skit thinks &quot;Cake?<br/>
Cake has milk, eggs, flour ...Sure, let&#39;s have cake!&quot; <br/>
