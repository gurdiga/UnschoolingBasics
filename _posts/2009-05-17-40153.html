<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937020305">I&#39;m pulling this out of another thread.<br/>
Robin B. said:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Truly, there is a small window for making positive changes for our children in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the span of their lifetimes. There is urgency in this.<br/>
*****************************<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, I agree that any kind of positive change Now is better than waiting for a &quot;better&quot; time or circumstances. Life is full of complications! Anything you can do to live more kindly, more thoughtfully and gently with your loved ones is best done now, today. <br/>
<br/>
At the same time, though, I don&#39;t want anyone to read something like the above and think &quot;well its too late for my family/kids&quot; - its not Ever too late to start bringing the principles of unschooling into your life - heck, my fifty-something year old aunt came with me to an unschooling conference a few weeks ago and got inspired to apply some of what she saw and heard to her relationship with her thirty-something daughter. Go Aunty! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying &quot;wait&quot; - don&#39;t wait, even if you don&#39;t think radical unschooling is &quot;possible&quot; for you, don&#39;t wait to look for more ways to have a better relationship with your kids right now. And don&#39;t stop looking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075801105">And we brought an almost 20 yr old very traditionally parented and<br/>
school oriented friend to last year&#39;s Northeast Unschooling conference -<br/>
and we weren&#39;t even out of the parking lot when she asked when she could<br/>
come along to the NEXT conference (took some juggling but we found a<br/>
lovely unschooling conference that fits with her other schedules - 6<br/>
weeks in France this summer plus starting back for her Junior year in<br/>
college in the fall). She&#39;s now firmly convinced that when she has kids,<br/>
this is how she wants to live from the start. DH and I have a running<br/>
joke that we&#39;re &quot;corrupting the youth&quot; by pointing out that the things<br/>
they&#39;ve been led to believe/accept (work hard in school, school is<br/>
important, and all that lot) really aren&#39;t what they seem.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s my now 92 yr old aunt who has never been to a conference<br/>
but really &quot;gets it&quot; and wishes she&#39;d known 40some years ago so she<br/>
could have spared her DS (her youngest of 4 children) the horrific time<br/>
he went through in school (BTW he&#39;s now one of the co-producers and<br/>
writers of the HBO series Big Love - now you can say you&#39;re connected to<br/>
lots of Hollywood biggies in the whole 6 degrees sense - Tom Hanks is<br/>
executive producer on the series).<br/>
