<div id="ygrps-yiv-953855548">Marla - when my kids have fought in a manner that is plain old mean - I grab<br/>
them both and put them on my lap (harder to do these days) wrap my arms<br/>
around them and tell them how much I love both of them.  And if that is not<br/>
enough to diffuse the moment, I will, like Ren, say that I don&#39;t want anyone<br/>
to talk to any one of my kids in that way.  They both feel defended and<br/>
loved at the same time.  And from there we can focus on a solution.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if your older dd needs help reframing her words so that when she is<br/>
feeling immense anger or frustration with her younger sib that is expressed<br/>
as an &#39;I hate you&#39; you can help to turn it around by acknowledging how much<br/>
she hates the situation.  I wouldn&#39;t attempt to devalue her feeling by a<br/>
corrective statement like, &quot;you don&#39;t hate your sib, you hate the<br/>
situation.&quot;  Because her truth in that moment is that her frustration and<br/>
anger has her feeling hatred toward her sib.  This is a horrible thing to<br/>
hear from your child about another one of your children.but she needs<br/>
something big from you here.because I am guessing that hating her sib really<br/>
doesn&#39;t feel good to her in her heart as well.  So by you acknowledging how<br/>
much she hates the situation (perhaps feeling powerless) can help her center<br/>
her feelings to thoughts that can then be expressed in a more rational<br/>
way.maybe.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So how do I deal with her telling her 4 yo. dd that if she eats<br/>
another popsicle she&#39;ll get fat (when we are trying to not control the<br/>
food they eat, other than their choices come from what we have<br/>
available at the moment) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When a child says something shaming to another child I might respond by<br/>
saying something like, &quot;I don&#39;t agree,&quot;  or &quot;now why would you think<br/>
something like that?&quot; in a very neutral way.  Tone is everything.  Think -<br/>
&quot;gosh - that surprises me - I don&#39;t understand it.&quot;  In your situation I am<br/>
wondering if your older dd is conscientious about her body weight (some<br/>
underlying message happening here from somewhere) that she is transferring<br/>
onto her sibling.  Is your older dd feeling frustrated by her own food<br/>
choices and asking for some help or guidance?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; or she calls her stupid and tells her to shut<br/>
up for singing too long?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Please don&#39;t call her stupid,&quot; is a reasonable response - again - tone is<br/>
everything - berating your older dd is antithetical to the point.  Perhaps<br/>
stroke your older dd&#39;s head while saying &quot;don&#39;t speak to her that way.&quot;   AS<br/>
to the singing too long.this is where maybe your instigating a creative<br/>
problem solving conversation to make the environment comfortable for<br/>
everyone  - include both sibs in the conversation as to what solution would<br/>
work for everyone.  You are as important as they are as to your comfort<br/>
level in your environment.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
While it may seem easier to solve conflict by separating the girls - I don&#39;t<br/>
agree that this is really the best solution in the long the run.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
help them to recognize each other, the struggles they feel and come to some<br/>
higher level of being together if the conflicts are not solved together.<br/>
Last year I had a conflict with a colleague and when I approached the<br/>
program director for assistance she stated that it&#39;s obvious we two had<br/>
communication problems and that she felt for now we shouldn&#39;t communicate<br/>
with one another.  Well that surely didn&#39;t solve anything.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As for not intervening.once I have intervened and the girls are both in a<br/>
rational state they do communicate and do get to a level place without me<br/>
having to say much more than what I&#39;ve stated above.  I have always said and<br/>
still believe the kids come up with better solutions than the limits of my<br/>
broad experience can imagine.  They are not restricted by the confines of<br/>
experience!!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps in some small way.<br/>

<br/>
I love this!<br/>
<br/>
That works sometimes around here, depending on the intensity level and<br/>
what exactly is unfolding. The times I&#39;ve done that, it usually<br/>
devolves into giggles or &quot;group hug&quot; or something similar and then<br/>
everyone is in a better place to discuss how they are feeling.<br/>
<br/>
I think hugs and love can work great when anger starts to well up.<br/>
