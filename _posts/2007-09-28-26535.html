<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261010116">I need some help thinking this through!  My mind is stuck and <br/>
struggling to see clearly the situation I created with my child.  I <br/>
am hoping that maybe you can see some creative ways to find peace.<br/>
<br/>
DS is 7 and an only.  We have been unschooling for about a year and <br/>
it has improved so many things in our lives it&#39;s amazing!  We have a <br/>
fairly small and very open single story house; there are not a lot of <br/>
options for finding private or personal space.<br/>
<br/>
DS loves Legos and very literally is taking over the entire house.  <br/>
There are Lego creations in every room of our house except the <br/>
laundry room (which is actually just a hallway).  He has a fantastic <br/>
imagination and creates huge complexes of interrelated elements.  <br/>
It&#39;s quite impressive and I love what he does!  BUT, there are so <br/>
many of them that they are no longer enjoyable to us, the parents.  <br/>
Some of these creations have been in their current location for <br/>
almost a year.  DS does not want to disassemble what he has made, <br/>
even though we have taken lots of pictures of them and created a <br/>
picture file of which he is very proud.<br/>
<br/>
DS wants more Legos.  I created a bigger problem by trying to <br/>
manipulate with a reward (which I get now, but not originally), I <br/>
told DS that I would buy his desired Lego set for him IF he would <br/>
remove all his Legos from the master bedroom, bathroom, office, <br/>
kitchen, floors, and from the hallways.  This leaves Legos in the  <br/>
living room, dining room, his room, and part of the family room, <br/>
still a very considerable area in our small house.  DS is very angry <br/>
that we are &quot;trying to make&quot; him take apart his creations.  He <br/>
correctly sees my offer as manipulative and self serving.  He has the <br/>
money to buy the set for himself, but that does not resolve the issue <br/>
of space.  I screwed up when I tried to make reclaiming my own space <br/>
a reward situation.  I need better ideas on how to respectfully and <br/>
honorably work this through.<br/>
<br/>
I keep trying to think about what I would say or do if it was my DH&#39;s <br/>
stuff that was taking over the house -- I don&#39;t think I would say or <br/>
do it differently, except that DH would not need me to help him &quot;get&quot; <br/>
the things (driving).  It&#39;s a problem regardless of whose stuff it <br/>
is. <br/>
<br/>
Bring on the ideas!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229051404">Have you thought of building a set of shelves specifically to display <br/>
his works? This would help to relocate them in a couple of areas instead <br/>
of all around the house, would showcase his work, and even help to feel <br/>
like he has a gallery of sorts. This would probably make it seem like he <br/>
was getting something rather than losing it. Is your hubby good with <br/>
tools/woodworking? If so maybe he could get help from your son in <br/>
designing and building the shelves.<br/>
<br/>
As an artist myself, having a place to display my art is highly <br/>
satisfying and rewarding.  Maybe having the same kind of display would <br/>
validate your son&#39;s artistry as well!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406326396">I took my son out of PS this week and expected a long time of <br/>
deschooling as he is 11 years old (12 in a week) and has had a LOT of <br/>
emotional trauma in school. His first day officially out of school, I <br/>
got a knock on the door while he was playing outside. He came bursting <br/>
in saying something pretty much incomprehensible about a woman being <br/>
outside. He looked terrified.<br/>
<br/>
I opened the door, and a well dressed woman was standing on my front <br/>
porch and she said &quot;I know boys will be boys, but your son threw a soda <br/>
can out in the street and nearly hit my car, I wanted to let someone <br/>
know, because he could have seriously hurt someone.&quot; Looking in the <br/>
street I saw at least five soda cans lying there. I thanked the woman <br/>
for letting me know, then promptly asked Caleb what he was doing. He <br/>
said he wanted to see what would happen to a full can of Dr. Topper (a <br/>
generic brand of Dr. Pepper like soda) when it exploded. Rather than <br/>
getting upset, I decided to make a point about learning things. I did <br/>
make him help me pick up the cans and put them in the recycle bin, then <br/>
took him inside and sat him down to explain what could have been the <br/>
consequences of his actions (causing a serious accident, us getting <br/>
sued, possibly losing the house, having charges filed etc.).  I told him <br/>
I wasn&#39;t going to do anything at that time, but now that he knew what <br/>
could have happened due to his &quot;experiment&quot;, I expected him to know that <br/>
it was wrong and not to do it again.<br/>
<br/>
It took me the evening thinking about it, but the next morning I went in <br/>
his room, and told him I wanted to make a deal with him. I said I <br/>
guaranteed that I would not get upset at any time with him if he wanted <br/>
to do something just to see what it would do, if he would come to me <br/>
first so I could make sure it is done safely, and without putting <br/>
anyone, or anyone&#39;s property in danger. To make my point, I asked him <br/>
what it was about seeing soda cans explode that interested him. He said <br/>
he just wanted to see what would happen. Then he got excited at the <br/>
prospect of doing this without the possibility of getting in trouble, so <br/>
he said he would also like to see what happened when you put Mentos in Coke.<br/>
<br/>
That day, we walked down to the gas station down the street, bought a 2 <br/>
liter of diet Coke, and a pack of Mentos, and came back home. We also <br/>
bought a 12 pack of Dr. Toppers as well. I also went in and got a pack <br/>
of baking soda and some vinegar, and as many small empty plastic <br/>
drinking bottles as I could find. My daughter (25) got involved too, and <br/>
we all went out back and had a wonderful time trying out different <br/>
things with Mento&#39;s, Coke, vinegar, baking soda and topped it all off by <br/>
trying to see the best way of making Dr. Topper&#39;s explode! Messy but <br/>
really good fun!<br/>
<br/>
We now have plans to make a trebuchet to fling highly shaken cans of <br/>
soda, pumpkins, tomatoes and whatever we can find, and I have a very <br/>
happy and more open young man tickled about the whole concept of <br/>
unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I think a part of the conceptual problem is that the &quot;artwork&quot; <br/>
is made out of parts that are designed to come apart easily. It <br/>
might help mom and dad to think about the creations in the same way <br/>
they would woodcarvings - something that can&#39;t really be <br/>
disassembled and the parts reused. <br/>
<br/>
Imagine if your home were filled with hand-carved sculptures and you <br/>
told your child you wouldn&#39;t buy any more wood unless he let you use <br/>
some of the sculptures for firewood. Doesn&#39;t sound very loving, does <br/>
it? <br/>
<br/>
I can certainly relate to the frustration of a home filled with <br/>
artwork in various states of completion. My dd(6) loves to create <br/>
all sorts of objects out of plain white paper - I sometimes struggle <br/>
to tell her scrap from her finished creations in my house full of <br/>
paper. I try to keep the &quot;bits&quot; picked up as much as possible, and <br/>
that helps *me* have places to walk and sit that aren&#39;t covered.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317551706">I love the idea of shelves. I have quite a few djembes and other hand<br/>
drums, and up to now, they&#39;ve been grouped together against one wall<br/>
of the living room. It takes up a lot of floor space! Just the other<br/>
day, I was envisioning a set of shelves... they&#39;d create a whole new<br/>
&quot;wall&quot; of shelves, each opening in the shelves designed for a specific<br/>
drum. So, instead of just straight shelves going across, it would be<br/>
more like stacked cubes, each cube just large enough to contain the<br/>
drum it held, making a pattern on the wall. Cool, huh?<br/>
<br/>
I bet some of those Lego creations are kinda wide, so that might not<br/>
be the optimum solution for those, but for some of the ones that<br/>
aren&#39;t, it might work. And it would look great!<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m off to google &quot;making shelves&quot;....<br/>

they are so big and complex.  We in fact had discussed adding on to <br/>
the house to create a &quot;work room&quot; of sorts.  DS liked the idea as one <br/>
to gain more building space, but strongly opposed the thought of <br/>

to be a more creative idea as to what to do with them!<br/>

one thing, which may help in the long run, is to take pictures of these  <br/>
items, enlarge and frame them, hang them up - take them from all angels too, so  <br/>
he can choose (if he likes this idea) which way - or all ways! - he wants to  <br/>
show the work off. he may not be ready to take them apart, but if/when he is,  <br/>
his work is still able to be displayed and won&#39;t be lost at all. Still  <br/>
thinking...(oh, a video too! and ya&#39;ll can play the tape or dvd whenever the  mood <br/>
strikes..maybe both ideas...maybe none, lol, or maybe them AND more!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-606885892">I did a quick search for displaying Legos - here is a thread of Lego<br/>
enthusiasts discussing how they display their creations:<br/>
HYPERLINK<br/>
&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.minifigcustomizationnetwork.com/forum/3423&quot;http://www.minifigcus">http://www.minifigcustomizationnetwork.com/forum/3423&quot;http://www.minifigcus</a><br/>
tomizationnetwork.com/forum/3423<br/>
 <br/>
We have many large art creations in our house too.  I put some display<br/>
shelves on various walls (you know the kind that are about 6&quot; deep and just<br/>
bracket onto the wall). We displayed many on bookshelves and a big wooden<br/>
trunk in our dining room.  We have art in the yard too (fairy houses, snail<br/>
houses including some made of Legos).<br/>
 <br/>
You could attach fishing line to the creations and &quot;fly&quot; some from the<br/>
ceiling.  I imagine several of these flying from his bedroom ceiling would<br/>
be very exciting.  You could get some of those glow in the dark moons and<br/>
stars and it might really seem as if there are spaceships flying around at<br/>
night.<br/>
 <br/>
We also have copious amounts of paper art.  Some are in sheet protectors in<br/>
a binder for each kid, some are framed and on the wall (we get framed prints<br/>
from thrift stores, remove the prints and reuse the frames).  One idea I saw<br/>
in Family Fun years ago was to paint the inside of the garage door so the<br/>
panels were like picture frames, and mount the art securely in each &quot;panel.&quot;<br/>
We used our garage for woodworking and other large projects - have an art<br/>
and workshop table in there, so that would have been a nice idea for us. (We<br/>
just moved and are in a rental temporarily so it would be something we<br/>
create when we arrive at a permanent house.)<br/>
