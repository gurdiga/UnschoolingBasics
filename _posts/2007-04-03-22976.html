<div id="ygrps-yiv-525772941">I have just joined :) and interested to share and read with you all.<br/>
I have two little girls, 4 and 21 mos. I have been on some close<br/>
groups and feel odd to just hop in here, hope it is ok ?!?!? lol<br/>
I have always known we were going to &quot;some other type of school&quot;, way<br/>
before we even had our children. Recently have I really looked hard<br/>
into unschooling, and it seems to be what I have been looking for. <br/>
Which leads me to why I am here :)<br/>
thanks, Melissa</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329729493">Glad to have you! Just FYI, I believe their are several Melissa&#39;s on the <br/>
group. You might want to add a last initial or state or whatever! I may be <br/>
the only one who gets confused?<br/>
I think unschooling is started before birth, but it took me a LONG time to <br/>
get the concept of unschooling and apply it to my family. I still learn <br/>
every day. My kiddos are 9, 13, and 16. I was unschooled, I officially left <br/>
government school at age 12.<br/>
