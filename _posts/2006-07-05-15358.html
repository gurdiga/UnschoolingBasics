Sorry for not stating being specific in that way.  I had seen other <br/>
books recommended on here and hadn&#39;t noticed that they <br/>
mentioned &quot;Christian&quot; or &quot;Secular&quot; or whatever else in the post.  I&#39;ll <br/>
know if the future.  Just as a side note in case anyone wonders, this <br/>
book has a lot of great information, Christian or not, just as many <br/>
other kinds of books do.<br/>
