<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167605645">I just want everyone here to know that Denise is a legit unschooler, <br/>
someone I would totally be happy to have in my home! If anyone can help <br/>
them it would be wonderful. I wish you could come stay with us in <br/>
P&#39;cola Denise, I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s no way to get here though.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone heard from Valerie Fitzenreiter? She&#39;s in Lake Charles, also <br/>
on the coast near the area Katrina hit. <br/>
Can anyone get money to Denise if we sent some? Please let us know.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone in that area evacuated to the East or North, there are homes <br/>
in Pensacola you are welcome to camp in! Many in our group are happy to <br/>
host displaced families if you can get to us. Please write me if you <br/>
could use a place down here to stay.<br/>
