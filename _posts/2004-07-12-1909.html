<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751897603">&quot;Does that mean that the reaction of the child who cried is &quot;her <br/>
problem&quot;? Does that mean that I do not feel responsible for the <br/>
impact of my yelling &quot;boo&quot; on the child who cried? Absolutely not!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
Not being responsible for another person&#39;s happiness, does not <br/>
negate responsibility for our own actions.<br/>
We are responsible to treat our children in ways we know they like. <br/>
We are responsible to create the best possible environment for joy.<br/>
We are responsible to do our very best at treating the children in <br/>
our home with the same respect we&#39;d give to adults and the <br/>
kindnesses we wished we&#39;d been given as children.<br/>
We are responsible for our own emotional health.<br/>
We are responsible for setting boundaries.<br/>
We are responsible for sharing the best information  we can with <br/>
people. (my personal one here:)<br/>
We are responsible fto listen when our children need to talk about <br/>
feelings.<br/>
<br/>
We are NOT responsible for how people percieve us.<br/>
We are not ultimately responsible for whether another human being is <br/>
happy or angry or depressed, though we are obviously going to do our <br/>
best to help those we love when they&#39;re dealing with those feelings.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s best to let go of that which we cannot control, and take <br/>
responsibility for that we DO control. I can control my own <br/>
emotional responses and actions. I can control the things I say. I <br/>
can control to a large degree, the environment in my home.<br/>
That&#39;s it.<br/>
Let go of the rest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140665006">&lt;&lt;&lt;We are responsible for our own emotional health.<br/>
We are responsible for setting boundaries.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This whole post is another keeper from Ren. <br/>
<br/>
It has sparked a thought from me. As some of you know I am very interested<br/>
in discourses and language use.<br/>
<br/>
It occurs to me that many people see the word &quot;boundaries&quot; and think<br/>
&quot;limits&quot;, as if they were interchangeable. Maybe they are. But...I wonder if<br/>
in Unschooling and how these ideas are applying to the personal<br/>
responsibility thread it is more helpful to consider the idea that<br/>
boundaries come *from* a person - like the fences if you are standing in the<br/>
middle of a field, whereas limits (or setting limits) are the person<br/>
standing *outside* the field trying to enclose the fence around someone<br/>
else. All we may have the right to do is enclose our personal field<br/>
(hopefully with gates!) although we can/should help our children with their<br/>
constructions....<br/>
