<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038560129">Just want to let y&#39;all know, if you haven&#39;t heard yet, Ray&#39;s <br/>
officially a homeschooler now! Wooo Hoo! We&#39;re all really happy about <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m sort of panicking about the whole deschooling thing, but <br/>

A 9 year old boy in our community just came back out of school after a year and a half. My DH and I were sitting in our living room and talking to him about leaving school and I remarked that I was &quot;really glad he quit school&quot;. DH started laughing and said, &quot;You don&#39;t hear THAT statement very often!&quot;<br/>
