<div id="ygrps-yiv-539018701">wow what a rip. I think I will just go to quiznoes(sp?) from now on. <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  OT~I have been reading alot about unschooling in a book that a good friend let me borrow. It is really interesting(I just thought about doing it) I really want to do unschooling and my kids already show an interest in science so I will be looking into ways to go further with that. <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
     Evan my oldest loves the planets so i thought about finding mag,games,national geo, and models as well as library books on planets.<br/>
  Jacob loves dinosaurs and I thought about doing the same things and going to museums of science as well. <br/>
  Is this what unschooling is about(I have only read about a chapter so far but this is what i think they were talking about). I would just love any ideas you all have. As you can tell I went to a school building and learned only from text books all my life. I hated it but the teachers that taught me the unconventional way (basically threw out the text used it when they had subs but never used it for themselves) i loved them and will remember them always.<br/>
  Sorry Becca for stealing your post. I promise not to do it again the question just came to mind so I had to ask when I could think of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192050225">I don&#39;t think this is a crime.  They have a right to determine the rules of a contest they made up.  It&#39;s not discrimination to make homeschools ineligible.  Every single homeschooler opted out of school.  We had a choice.   <br/>
<br/>
They believe five thousand dollars of fitness equipment will benefit more kids on a playground or in a gym than it will a couple of kids in an apartment in Detroit.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Subway owes homeschoolers anything.  I don&#39;t think we need special consideration because we homeschool. <br/>
<br/>
If we can&#39;t buy some of those cheap Scholastic books or find them at a library and make some kind of good sandwiches available to our kids or get them to the park to play, we maybe shouldn&#39;t be homeschooling. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307597351">Personally I just figure that not everything in life is fair. Win some, lose some. I am not out anything by subway having a contest that does not include me. There are lots of contests etc that exclude certain people...either you have to be a certain age or only people in a certain city can apply etc. Maybe subway will get a tax write off if they donate to a school. Also, just because a homeschooler could donate the stuff it does not mean they will and it just does not make sense to donate 5,000 dollars of gym equipment to one person. <br/>
The difference between saying that blacks are not eligible is that skin color is not a choice. I chose to homeschool and I am happy that these days quite a few things do include homeschool children. Years ago it was not as accepted as it is now.<br/>
I guess I just do not understand the anger that my kid is not included in a contest that is meant to donate stuff to a school. I am glad that some school that may be short on funding will get 5,000 dollars worth of equipment that will benefit 100&#39;s of kids daily. My kids have lots of other opportunities that kids who go to school do not have.<br/>
Just my opinion...I will save my energy and fight for something that really needs it.<br/>
off to go get some subway for lunch yumm<br/>

  I do think it is discrimination. Homeschoolers could donate to the YMCA , local park, local recreational centers, boys and girls clubs,even schools.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124830058">Absolutely. But some people are gay and I beleive they are born gay while others say it is a choice. <br/>
  When people discriminate against gay people are they saying that gay people chose to be gay and therefore it is OK to exclude them.<br/>
  I have a problem with all kind of discriminations.<br/>
  A lot of people that breastfeed in public are discriminated for it in this country by people who don&#39;t bat and eye if they see bottle feeding.<br/>
  It is wrong. ( read my blog of what happened to me )<br/>
   <br/>
  The contest could have rules that included all children.<br/>
  Like I said I do understand them wanting the money to go benefit  a large number of children.<br/>
  That could have been acomplished without excluding a group of children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-839041781">This is what I sent to my local lists on this subject. I wish folks would <br/>
stop and breathe and not automatically forward on to other lists AND write angry <br/>
hostile emails themselves.<br/>
<br/>
**Please pass this on to other homeschoolers so they too can write to Subway <br/>
about this.**<br/>
<br/>
Um, well.... my personal opinion is that Subway could use educating in how to <br/>
structure a contest intended to help schools serve their communities in ways <br/>
that will allow homeschoolers to participate while still fulfilling that <br/>
community building purpose. The top prize includes $5000 of sports equipment for <br/>
the winner&#39;s school - it makes sense that Subway does not want that going to an <br/>
individual family but for a school that serves many many many families. I <br/>
don&#39;t see that as being discriminatory toward homeschool kids, but as a failure of <br/>
their marketing department to figure out a fair way to include our kids. I <br/>
don&#39;t believe that they intend to discriminate against homeschooler kids, just <br/>
that their intent for the contest is ultimately to award $5000 of sports <br/>
equipment where it will benefit a whole community of children, not enrich an <br/>
individual family.<br/>
<br/>
I think ultimately it&#39;s best to help them imagine how they include us in a <br/>
way that still fulfills their intent, rather than excorciate them for excluding <br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
Similar contests involving books have been structured to award the &quot;school&quot; <br/>
part of the prize to a public library, for instance, if won by a homeschool <br/>
student. What similar situation could be suggested for a sports equipment award? <br/>
Park districts maybe?<br/>
<br/>
I personally would SO much rather that Subway get a message that our kids <br/>
would like to participate and how can we make that happen, than that they get <br/>
inundated with emails from angry moms about discrimination that can easily be <br/>
dismissed as greedy grasping.<br/>

My kids LOVE Subway and I have spent more money than I care to count because<br/>
they would rather go there than anyplace else.  My eight year old wants to<br/>
work there when she&#39;s old enough!  One thing for certain, as homschoolers,<br/>
my eight and eleven year old can think for themselves and are quite savy<br/>

<br/>
Well, yeah. I think that&#39;s what they&#39;re saying.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers probably know better than others that we cannot control what other folks think.<br/>
Discrimination isn&#39;t nice but discrimination is, I think, an exaggeration of this little matter, which is a contest to win a prize for ones elementary school.  It&#39;s not open to adults and it&#39;s not open to kids past sixth grade because the prize is for an elementary school.   The owner of your local &quot;Curves&quot; can&#39;t win it for her gym .  Physical therapists aren&#39;t eligible to win for their therapy clinics.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe there are a thousand unschooling kids who are going to be disappointed they can&#39;t win, but I don&#39;t think so.  I&#39;m guessing most homeschooling kids wouldn&#39;t be entering for the fun of it anyway they&#39;d be entering because their mom would think it would be a good writing exercise.   Unschooling kids can write any story they want any time and then go get a sandwich and take it to the park....with a basket of books. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262102416">I agree that most if not all unschooled kids could not care less about htis contest.<br/>
  <br/>
But they should have  found a way not to exclude homeschoolers in general.<br/>
  They did think about them. They just did not think they were important enough  I guess.<br/>
   <br/>
  I aplaud them for wanting to give the big prize to schools that probably need them. I am not against school per se. I would  be glad if my kid wanted to compete in it and we could win and give the big prize to a much needed school.<br/>
  But they did not give us that choice.<br/>
