I  don&#39;t agree that EVERYONE at some point is an unschooler just<br/>
because they  learn something on their own. That really waters down the<br/>
whole meaning for  me, to the point that it&#39;s a useless  discussion.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I have found it very useful when doing talks about unschooling to be able  to <br/>
reach that point with people.  Have them see, in their own lives, those  <br/>
times when they learned something that wasn&#39;t in school, learned something like  <br/>
building a deck or planting a garden or about fishing, by maybe reading about  <br/>
it, talking to people in the field, experimenting etc.  Then I can really  <br/>
talk to them about learning through life, following an interest or need that was  <br/>
their own and not someone else&#39;s.  <br/>
 <br/>
Finding that *something* really helps me show them about  unschooling, and <br/>
talk about unschooling.  For me it doesn&#39;t water anything  down, it brings us <br/>
all together in a place where we can really talk about  it.<br/>
 <br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>
