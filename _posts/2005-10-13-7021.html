Sounds like he is too. Take a breath and remember why he is the most special boy in the whole entire world. Give him a hug and smell his hair.<br/>

You did the best with the information you had at the time. We&#39;re here to give you some new ideas to work with. I&#39;m thinking he&#39;ll need some time to recover from all that schooling. Expect some bumps in the road and just remember it&#39;s tough for him too.<br/>

We were all newbies once. And yes he is deschooling. He&#39;s reacting. He&#39;s probably confused and disoriented with the new schedule and expectations. What did you do on school breaks with him? Try to make this new time together like an extended break from school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478858143">Thank you Mary.  He is the most special boy in the whole world and I love to smell his hair!  I lay down with him at night and I rad to him for a while.  Then we talk a bit more.  Finally I tell him I am tired and we need to go to sleep.  He asked me tonight why I have less energy then he does.  He said I am an energetic boy.  I aid yes, you are (and actually felt proud of the fact even though  tired).  He asked me why I had less energy then he does and even though he knows I have MS I decided that we didn&#39;t need to talk about hat again right before nodding off.  So I just said well honey, sometimes grown ups just get tired before kids do.  He thought that was funny.  I know many nights after he has fallen asleep before I crawl out of his bed I lay there for a while just basking in the joy of having such a sweet kid.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are thinking about allowing him to stay up without having to go to sleep when we decide (so we can have an hour to talk alone in our bedroom).   <br/>
<br/>
On school breaks I tried to keep him busy but I can see how that is not working so well for him now as I have rad others postings.  I think he needs less scheduled activities and some more &quot;down&quot; time :)<br/>
