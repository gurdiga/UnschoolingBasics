<div id="ygrps-yiv-740171935">I just want to say, I like Connection Parenting and I have not read<br/>
Parenting From the Heart. I have had the good fortune to meet Pam Leo a few<br/>
times. She is a wonderful, caring and thoughtful person though not<br/>
necessarily an unschooler (she homeschools her grand-daughter who is a<br/>
really neat person as well). If you are looking for a radical unschooling<br/>
type book, I wonder if this book would be satisfying for you. It is a great<br/>
resource for parents who have been mainstream all along and are<br/>
transitioning to a more attachment parenting style of coexistence with their<br/>
children. Granted I read a pre-published copy and it has been a while since<br/>
I have communicated with Pam. I have taken her Meeting the Needs of Children<br/>
series of classes/workshops. I learned a lot and they are part of the<br/>
process that brought me to unschooling. She is one of the founding/charter<br/>
members of the &quot;Alliance for Transforming the Lives of Children&quot; and is<br/>
currently serving as their secretary.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.atlc.org/">http://www.atlc.org/</a> If you visit their website, it can offer more insight<br/>
to what you might read in her book.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So if you are looking for someone who is going to support the idea of<br/>
unlimited screen time, rising and sleeping according to their own internal<br/>
rhythm, &quot;allowing&quot; a child to eat chocolate cake for breakfast I don&#39;t think<br/>
you will find that in her book. If you want a person who understands that a<br/>
child &quot;acting out&quot; is more likely to be an indicator of a child who is<br/>
hungry, thirsty, tired, uneasy, scared etc. it is a great book. There is<br/>
information in there about how our own unresolved childhood issues can<br/>
affect our parenting without us even being aware unless we work hard to<br/>
observe those effect. There is information about the importance of close<br/>
bonding. There is a lot in there that may remind folks of Jean Liedloff&#39;s<br/>
Continuum Concept  or Joseph Chilton Pearce&#39;s Magical Child There is<br/>
information on respectful communication with children being seen as an<br/>
individual person, rather than a bundle of trouble needing to be &quot;broken&quot;<br/>
into a mold someone else designed. So there is information in there that can<br/>
line up nicely with unschooling as a lifestyle and there is information in<br/>
there that is likely to seem contrary to radical unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As much as I want to help Pam sell as many books as possible as she believes<br/>
fully in making the world a better place for all children, being that this<br/>
is an unschooling list, I wanted to offer my own insight so that if you<br/>
decide to go ahead with the purchase it doesn&#39;t become a &quot;I wish I&#39;d bought<br/>
the other one&quot; kind of thing. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps at least a little bit. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692680127">Thanks Lisa!  I&#39;m glad you wrote because it is specifically for recognizing what I can heal about myself that will allow me to be more connected to my girls, and also to learn to see them more as individuals...moving towards a radical unschooling lifestyle.  I have always been an attachment type parent with my girls, I just feel I need more tools, especially with them moving into their 3&#39;s and pushing every single button of every single unresolved issue I have going on!  I have many RU books already, and so this sounds like a fit for me right now...I&#39;ll just take what feels right for us and leave the rest like I do with everything else under the sun.  It does sound like she is doing much needed work on behalf of children, and I will be happy to support that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779309728">I am glad I can help. Her book and the classes helped me identify a lot <br/>
of my automatic scripts I was playing in my head regarding my <br/>
interactions with ds. My exposure to the information really came at an <br/>
opportune time for me to really delve into how my childhood was <br/>
affecting me and my relationship withds. It brought up a LOT of grief. <br/>
During one of the workshops, Pam has everyone bring a picture of <br/>
themselves at a young age. She then plays the song, &quot;How Could Anyone?&quot; <br/>
by Libby Roderick and asked us to imagine ourselves saying that to the <br/>
child we were then. It tore me up. I cried and grieved for a long time. <br/>
I still have an emotional response to thinking about that. It was a <br/>
pivotal moment in my life and in my relationship with my son. I didn&#39;t <br/>
want him to come to a point in his life 20 or 30 years down the road <br/>
and have to endure such a deep feeling of despair and feeling unwanted. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that when you get to read it, you find yourself in a better <br/>
place than when you started out. I know I did. :)<br/>
