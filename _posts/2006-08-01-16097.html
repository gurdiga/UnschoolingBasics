<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394848249">&quot;How do you seasoned radicals think fast enough to avoid the raised<br/>
voices/threats/punishments? and what will our kids think of us if we<br/>
constantly reconfigure how we handled a certain situation in the past?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t always!!!:) But I do hear it as a very dissonant chord when it<br/>
comes out of my mouth, and I rephrase or try to start over. <br/>
<br/>
As far as what our children think, if we reconfigure? Hopefully, that<br/>
we&#39;re learning and growing right along with them!! Sierra said &quot;You&#39;re<br/>
the best mom EVER&quot; today. Sweet, but I said &quot;I don&#39;t know about that,<br/>
but I&#39;m learning how to be a better Mom every day&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which is true. Every interaction, every day gives us moments to make<br/>
new and better choices. That&#39;s how growth works.:)<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list!<br/>

Ren! You take compliments graciously in the spirit they are given!<br/>
<br/>
Say simply, &quot;Thank you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t negate *her* feelings!<br/>

But since it&#39;s here. I DO think we need to accept our children&#39;s <br/>
compliments graciously. &quot;Thank you&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m glad you think so&quot; are <br/>
fine responses. Saying that maybe you&#39;re not negates the child&#39;s <br/>
feelings. She really thinks so. That&#39;s wonderful! Enjoy it!<br/>

&gt; Oh I am SO glad that you said that here, Kelly.  I think people need to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hear that and learn it.  My best friend taught me years ago that the only<br/>
acceptable response to a compliment was &quot;thank you.&quot;  I had a very bad habit<br/>
of accepting a compliment and either negating it or lessening it.  For<br/>
instance someone would say, &quot;You look very nice today.  Your hair is<br/>
different or something.&quot;  I would respond, &quot;MY hair?  Oh I can never do<br/>
anything with it.&quot;  Whenever I would do this with Melissa she would say, &quot;No<br/>
no no.  the only acceptable response to a compliment is thank you.  Now<br/>
start over.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had problems until I realized that by negating someone&#39;s compliment  <br/>
it&#39;s really insulting them. If they say &quot;I like that dress,&quot; and I  <br/>
say, &quot;Oh, this old thing?&quot; or something I&#39;m basically saying &quot;Boy, do  <br/>
you have bad taste!&quot; I try to keep that in mind when I feel the urge  <br/>
to downplay a compliment.<br/>
