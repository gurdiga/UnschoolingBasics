&lt;&lt; If your kids previously read a lot of novels, in particular, <br/>
are they watching shows and movies and playing games that have novel-<br/>
like qualities? That was something I found *myself* doing when we <br/>
first got Netflix, and then again when I discovered fantasy role-<br/>
playing computer games (there aren&#39;t nearly enough of these!) I had <br/>
been &quot;trained&quot; to think that movies and shows and games were somehow <br/>
less than reading, but when I was able to step away from that I <br/>
could see how I was choosing to watch and play the same sorts of <br/>
things I would choose to read. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is my first post, here, I think, and I really liked this point, and <br/>
wanted to add a smiliar one about writing.<br/>
 <br/>
I write *all* the time, in my head.  I think up ideas, connect them and <br/>
organize them, but I just don&#39;t always feel the need to write them down and share <br/>
them.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve discovered my 11yo daughter does the same thing, it&#39;s just disguised as <br/>
playing with stuffed animals.  Most people interpret this as &quot;she loves <br/>
animals and will probably grow up to be a vet.&quot;  But that&#39;s not really it.  She&#39;s <br/>
writing.  She&#39;s creating characters.  They each have their own separate <br/>
identity, she imagines what each one would say to each of the others in various <br/>
situations and settings.  She thinks up plots and works out conflicts.  It&#39;s all <br/>
part of the writing process, it&#39;s not all that visible unless you&#39;re looking for <br/>
it because so much of it is happening *inside* her head. <br/>
 <br/>
Her friends do the same thing, and recently they started having e-mail <br/>
conversations between the animals.  So then it was obvious.  I could see her sitting <br/>
at the computer typing up dialog in each character&#39;s particular voice and <br/>
seeing *in writing* (proof!!!) that it really is writing.  But by then I didn&#39;t <br/>
really need the proof, because we&#39;ve been doing this long enough for me to <br/>
learn to trust that valuable things are happening in her head, all the time, and <br/>
that each thing doesn&#39;t have to lead to something more &quot;productive&quot; and <br/>
&quot;schooly-looking&quot; to be worthwhile.<br/>
