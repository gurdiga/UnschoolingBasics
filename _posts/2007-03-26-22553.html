<div id="ygrps-yiv-243234680">Hello!  I&#39;m Rebecca, mama to 1 dd (turning 2yo in &lt;gulp&gt; 11 days) in <br/>
Colorado.  I&#39;ve been lurking here and on several other unschooling <br/>
groups for a few months now.  I suppose we have been unschooling from <br/>
the start.  I just didn&#39;t know that&#39;s what it&#39;s called.  We&#39;ve never <br/>
had limits or training regarding food, sleep, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
We did take one signing class when dd was 12 months old, but we <br/>
didn&#39;t do our homework or even go to half of the classes due to <br/>
napping and otherwise not being in the mood (dd&#39;s mood ;) ).  <br/>
Everyone I know seems to think baby signing is so wonderful, but <br/>
those classes were disturbing to me.  The instructor created <br/>
pressure/competition by asking how many signs our babies were doing <br/>
at the start of each class.  Some of the suggested teaching methods <br/>
were creepy too, such as pausing between giving the baby bites of <br/>
food until they signed &quot;more&quot; and &quot;food.&quot;  No one I&#39;ve talked to <br/>
about this seems to understand my discomfort, but perhaps some of you <br/>
understand what I&#39;m saying. Anyway, that experience led me to <br/>
thinking about homeschooling then unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My dh and I have been learning about unschooling and also reading <br/>
about NVC and consensual living.  Fortunately he is all for it, <br/>
although I think we both have some deschooling to do.  I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine our families will be accepting, but they haven&#39;t understood <br/>
most of our parenting choices (homebirth, no vax, extended <br/>
breastfeeding, etc.)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m starting to wonder about how unschooling will affect my <br/>
friendships though.  I have been fortunate to have developed <br/>
friendships with like-minded mamas around attachment parenting.  When <br/>
our children were infants, we were all doing similar things.  Now <br/>
that we are parenting toddlers and some school-aged children, our <br/>
parenting styles are starting to feel much different. We still share <br/>
some common interests of course, but there&#39;s so much talk about <br/>
preschools/schools, giving rewards and overall *conditional* <br/>
parenting, subtly and not-so-subtly comparing kids&#39; aptitude at <br/>
various skills...I&#39;m starting to feel like an outsider even among my <br/>
outsider friends.  <br/>
<br/>
How have your friendships changed as you became an unschooling <br/>
parent?  <br/>
<br/>
How do you and your children maintain friendships with others who are <br/>
approaching general living in a very different way?  <br/>
<br/>
TIA for your input.  I&#39;ve learned so much here already!  <br/>

<br/>
You may find yourself losing those friends....but making others! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Parenting choices seem to be the number one reason for relationships to <br/>
end. Like: your choice of mate and then your parenting style---the two <br/>
things that&#39;ll end a friendship! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How have your friendships changed as you became an unschooling<br/>
parent?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they aren&#39;t hard-core unschoolers, they have no kids: we&#39;ve found we <br/>
have better relationships with childless friends.<br/>
<br/>
Oh---and long-distance friends whom we never see. Old Air Force <br/>
friends---we were buds before children or when our kids were babies. We <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be friends if we lived nearby; but because we see each other <br/>
every 2-3 years, it&#39;s no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re soooo much happier when we do things with other radical <br/>
unschoolers. And we all go out of our ways to make these arrangements. <br/>
In fact, we&#39;re meeting up with a bunch of (80!) radical unschoolers <br/>
this weekend, going to PA with three other radical unschooling families <br/>
next week, and having another radical unschooling family from Ohio for <br/>
Easter Dinner. No one&#39;s from around here. We&#39;re all making a HUGE <br/>
effort to be together. But it&#39;s sooo worth it! Kids play so well <br/>
together! No one asks about curriculum. &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s just a pleasant way to <br/>
live!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How do you and your children maintain friendships with others who are<br/>
approaching general living in a very different way?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t much. We don&#39;t do &quot;family&quot; outings with extended family <br/>
either. It&#39;s just too painful to watch them be so mean to their kids. <br/>
They don&#39;t hit or anything---it&#39;s just the underlying meanness that&#39;s <br/>
incredibly intolerable. The comparing and shaming and bickering. Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
The more we get to know unschoolers, the more we like them. And the <br/>
more unschoolers we can bring &quot;into the fold,&quot; the more friends *we* <br/>
will have and the more friends our kids will have.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason for the conferences! To meet more unschoolers!<br/>

<br/>
Kelly, I just wanted to repeat that again. What I have<br/>
noticed most about my kids meeting other unschoolers<br/>
is how well they all play together. We now have<br/>
regular meetings, with a lot of swordfighting going<br/>
on, but no-one gets hurt and everyone has so much fun.<br/>
 And I love their moms too and am finally finding that<br/>
I am not the odd one out anymore !<br/>
Thanks to you all!<br/>
Love,<br/>
Mara<br/>

folks you&#39;ll figure out how they treat their kids. It<br/>

Some unschoolers can be very restrictive in<br/>

I&#39;m wouldn&#39;t bet that you&#39;ve pissed Ren off. It&#39;s clear that you did not<br/>
read the guidelines before you joined this list. It can be frustrating<br/>
getting into these long threads about an individuals right to unbridled<br/>
self-expression. Lists have guidelines for a reason. People come here for<br/>
help and guidance from the UNSCHOOLING point of view. In that sense, all are<br/>
welcome, whatever your religious affiliation or lack thereof. This list has<br/>
guidelines in order to keep it focused, productive, and growth-oriented,<br/>
IMO. That is my experience of it. When people go off in this unbridled way,<br/>
it takes time, effort, and energy to try and help the unbridled one see the<br/>
real purpose of this list and how it might actually benefit them to stay<br/>
within list guidelines. When it becomes clear that a person will continue to<br/>
insist on their &quot;right&quot; to speak as they wish, taking up people&#39;s precious<br/>
time and resources, then, personally, as an extremely appreciative member of<br/>
this list, I have no problem seeing that person blocked from posting. If I<br/>
want to find God, a god, goddesses, or anything else under the sun, I&#39;m<br/>
pretty sure there&#39;s a list out there somewhere for just that thing. Please,<br/>
beautifulsassyprincess, go find a list that welcomes your need to preach.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193167832">Thanks Lisa & Manisha.  I will keep a more open mind about the <br/>
homeschool groups.  I have met some homeschooling families through La <br/>
Leche League now that I think about it.  I think they&#39;re using <br/>
curriculum, but they are respectful to their children.  <br/>
<br/>
My local AP group has one unschooling family, but the children are <br/>
teens.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I will make new friends.  I think I&#39;m just processing the <br/>
changes in my current friendships.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238465205">&quot;It seems awkward to seek out the hs crowd when my dd isn&#39;y 2yo&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Actually,  in our little town in Montana we welcome everyone so far, certainly people whose kids are 2, or one, or newborn. We have had an expectant Mom. When is too early? It&#39;s not possible to be too early to us!  <br/>
