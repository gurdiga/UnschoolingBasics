<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864488840">I just read &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; and enjoyed it very much except for <br/>
the fact that the author only had one child so for me (four kids and <br/>
possibly more) to relate to some of her ideas was difficult.  I still <br/>
think she makes wonderful sense and I am just so overjoyed that my <br/>
husband and I have finally embraced the radical unschooling life.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other similar books with an unschooling approach related <br/>
to larger families? dealing with siblings sharing/fighting and other <br/>
issues that come from sharing a house with lots of little loved ones?<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Amy</div>
