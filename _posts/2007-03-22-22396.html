<div id="ygrps-yiv-373388863">Well, if you�re unschooling, you�re in it and you�ve been in it since<br/>
day one with each of them!! :-)  You might want to take a look at the<br/>
Links on this Yahoo group too get a better idea of what unschooling<br/>
entails.  <br/>

for new ways of exploring.<br/>
<br/>
as a family who has always unschooled there was no difference in how we <br/>
lived our life when my child turned &#39;school&#39; age.  the differences on how <br/>
she approaches learning comes from her drives, desires and abilities.  it is <br/>
amazing to witness the growth that organically occurs that has nothing to do <br/>

will unfold for each child.<br/>

Have you read anything about unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
What do you know about it? Where did you hear about it?<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t use the &quot;c&quot; word here. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you heard the terms &quot;natural learning&quot; or &quot;organic learning?&quot; <br/>
&quot;Life learning?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why would anyone buy Sonlight or Abeka? What would you be looking for <br/>
from them?<br/>
<br/>
How can you keep things from happening?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now why would you even think to do that?  I think you missed my point.  One <br/>
thing that might be helpful is to recognize that unschooling means letting <br/>
go of the &quot;school age&quot; vernacular.  All ages are learning ages...school <br/>
doesn&#39;t define what we do and how we do it.<br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t waste your money on prescribed book work for kids under the age of (?) <br/>
..spend it on adventures, toys, traveling, museums, field trips, computers, <br/>
books, charitable endeavors, feeding the hungry and housing the homeless <br/>
etc. etc. etc.<br/>
