<div id="ygrps-yiv-696289507">Thank you to those who took time to respond.  :)  I understand that <br/>
just everyday life presents itself with numbers and problems that <br/>
causes us to have to reason.  That is how I always saw it.  To me that <br/>
is plenty of math.  But my daughter is very goal, schedule, and text-<br/>
book type focused.  The only time I ever bought her a text book was at <br/>
her request.  She wants a high school diploma and be done with Algebra <br/>
2 by the time she is 15.  I don&#39;t agree with her, I think she is <br/>
misguided by false notions.  We have talked about this at great length <br/>
over the years and she still wants to be and live and COMPLETE things <br/>
quickly.  What am I to do?  The only thing I can figure out, is to <br/>
suppot her.  How do I help her get to where SHE WANTS to be in the <br/>
next 2 years if she is so far behind?  Anyone have a situation like <br/>
this?  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If this is something that she really wants to do or feels that she<br/>
must do for herself, what about hiring a tutor?  There always seem to<br/>
be tutor type people around homeschool groups - former teachers who<br/>
are now homeschooling or dads who have a knack for a particular<br/>
subject.  See if you can find someone who can explain algebra in a way<br/>
that makes sense to her.  In the movie Big (Yeah, I keep bringing that<br/>
up LOL!) Tom Hanks&#39; character is at this dinner party and the host&#39;s<br/>
son keeps popping in asking for help with his school work.  Algebra<br/>
comes up and Tom&#39;s character (who is just a 13yo boy trapped in a 30<br/>
yo body) says, &quot;Oh, I know math&quot; and he goes and shows the boy how<br/>
doing algebra is a lot like baseball.  &quot;ding ding ding ding ding&quot;<br/>
suddenly it all makes sense.  Algebra never made sense to me until<br/>
someone showed me how it worked in a physical way (using blocks to<br/>
show me how algebra was just completing sets to make whole figures all<br/>
those x&#39;s and b&#39;s and a&#39;s were just the negative spaces)<br/>
<br/>
It also might help your daughter to talk through why she feels that<br/>
algebra is important to her.  Have you both read the Teenage<br/>
Liberation Handbook?  Might be helpful and insightful.<br/>
