<div id="ygrps-yiv-533012980">Wow- I actually clarified that &quot;sleep silence&quot; thing yesterday morning, to say that yes, complete silence would be creepy, and that the non electronic sounds of the nature and the night are what I was intending to represent, but 2 of my posts never came through.  Maybe it&#39;s a moderation issue?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to have found several online unschooling groups to be part of.  I&#39;m not sure why members of this specific group use such non-gentle language toward one another, but I&#39;m finding it difficult to continue to learn and grow from interactions on this list.  I feel sad for other readers who were attacked from every angle and had each sentence ripped to shreds.  I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found an environment that feels supportive for you, but I don&#39;t think this is the place for me.  Life is too short to have to deliberately separate people&#39;s angry emotions form their post to try & find the gems of wisdom and insight that are readily available on forums with a more positive focus.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy having my ideas challenged, but kind and nonjudgemental language is much easier to digest.  I&#39;m enjoying it on other unschooling forums, so I will spend more time there.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you all, I hope your journeys are enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lisa will probably be back later.  At least that is how it happened for <br/>
me too.  I rejoined a couple of these lists, the most challenging to <br/>
me, several times before the messages really permeated my thinking <br/>
processes.  It&#39;s unfortunate that it seems like an attack when really <br/>
it&#39;s just a major discomfort to have your way of thinking very closely <br/>
examined.  One thing I&#39;ve learned throughout my own unschooling journey <br/>
is that the ideas that really stung me and made me feel immediately <br/>
defensive were the ones that really needed to be closely examined.  I <br/>
had the most trouble letting those go.  It really did take years before <br/>
I felt like an unschooler.  I hope to help others weather that <br/>
challenging journey.  But truthfully, the people on this list and <br/>
others like it can only provide insights and wisdoms along the way.  <br/>
The hardest work has to be done by the person on the journey.  But it&#39;s <br/>
so worth it!!<br/>
