<div id="ygrps-yiv-807790803">so the kids are watching Dora, and they are finding what&#39;s &#39;wrong&#39;  <br/>
with the picture.<br/>
<br/>
So the first question is where do the clouds belong, in the sky or on  <br/>
the ground and Rachel says &quot;Is it a foggy day?&quot;<br/>
The second question is what&#39;s wrong with the tree (it&#39;s upside down)  <br/>
and Sam says &quot;Some plants in the rain forest grow that way.&quot;<br/>
The third question is where does a fish belong, in a nest or in the  <br/>
lake and Dan says &quot;On my plate with tartar sauce&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ROTFL.....I love unschooling. Josh always got in trouble at school  <br/>
for not accepting the right/wrong on those sheets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153660029">LOL sounds a lot like our house! I had a professor in college (a <br/>
business management course) who told us the first day that the answer <br/>
to every question in his class was &quot;It depends&quot;...of course, we had to <br/>
know what kinds of follow up questions to ask to arrive at a conclusion <br/>
(where do clouds belong? it depends..., is it foggy? is it raining? are <br/>
you on a mountaintop?...) I&#39;ve held onto that one tidbit (don&#39;t <br/>
remember much of the rest of the class at all) and we play games with <br/>
that all the time.<br/>

Makes me think of the book I was reading today ~Frogotten Ellis Island~ <br/>
and it was talking about the intelligence tests they gave the <br/>
immigrants and how some wouldn&#39;t give the *right* answers because the <br/>
questions were asinine; for example a woman was asked whether it was <br/>
better to sweep a dirty staircase from top to bottom or bottom to top <br/>
and she said she hadn&#39;t come to America to sweep stairs.<br/>
