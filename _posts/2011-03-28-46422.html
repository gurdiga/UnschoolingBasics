<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106868549">This morning my six-year-old son and I were discussing the American Revolution & the Civil War--he&#39;s watching America: The Story of Us (a second time).<br/>
<br/>
He suggested the invention of an &quot;automatic bayonet&quot; to replace the standard ol&#39; bayonet.  Immediately I began to explain what &quot;automatic&quot; means in regard to weaponry--and that a bayonet cannot really be made &quot;automatic,&quot; nor would there be any point in making it so NOW.<br/>
<br/>
About ten minutes into the &quot;argument&quot; I stopped.  I felt like I was simply fighting with him and quite frankly, does it matter that he know an automatic bayonet is unnecessary in 2011?<br/>
<br/>
What are your thoughts on this one--am I wrong to let him believe a bayonet could/should be made into some type of automatic weapon or should I just let his six-year-old mind mull it over?<br/>
<br/>
In other words, &quot;pick my battles.&quot;  No pun intended.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250767813">With 11 y/o Draven, who is completely into weapons and war, I try not to<br/>
negate his ideas to often.  If he says something that I know is incorrect<br/>
(some fact based thing, not an idea he has) we&#39;ll talk about good and bad<br/>
sources for information and try to find him more correct information.  With<br/>
his ideas I ask lots of questions which shows that I&#39;m interested, and also<br/>
helps him think through his idea more.   I don&#39;t try to get him to realize<br/>
his idea won&#39;t work, I honestly try to find out more.  Sometimes he realizes<br/>
it wouldn&#39;t work, or that there&#39;s something better already, sometimes he<br/>
surprises me with how well thought out his idea is.<br/>
<br/>
Questions like<br/>
<br/>
What would it look like?<br/>
How would it work?<br/>
Where could they use it?<br/>
What materials should it be made out of?<br/>
Could it be produced in a factory or would it have to be hand made?<br/>
Who would it help?<br/>
<br/>
The questions I ask depend on his mood at the time, and sometimes his answer<br/>
is &quot;I&#39;m not sure&quot; and he moves on, other times we&#39;ll spend days touching on<br/>
the subject of his idea.<br/>

No one needed an iPad but fortunately Steve Jobs wasn&#39;t argued out of  <br/>

<br/>
The greatest ideas will come from the freedom to play with ideas and  <br/>
see where they take someone than from being told by someone older and  <br/>
&quot;wiser&quot; how the world is.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of an arguement, say &quot;Cool! Tell me about it.&quot; :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935936663">When I was little I had a HUGE arguement with my grandma. I was about 7 or so.<br/>
We debated whether quarter after 2 was 15 minutes or 25 minutes. As an adult,<br/>
out of the blue, I looked back and felt bad for thinking I was smarter than she.<br/>
I am sure that homeschooling has many more of those instances. Kids think they<br/>
are smarter than their parents. I am sure it is a healthy developmental stage.<br/>
So, I would try to explain things to him, but the stuff that doesn&#39;t matter he<br/>
will figure out as he gets older and self correct. Also, homeschooling your<br/>
child has power struggles that children in public school may not have, at least<br/>
not as often. I have found that the battles I have fought with my kids were<br/>
resolved after I let go of the need to be right, and allowed other people (even<br/>
strangers) provide the information that they rebutted from me. Being a HS mom<br/>
has struggles and if you do not choose your battles wisely you can get very<br/>
stressed out. The best thing about homeschooling is when tensions are higher<br/>
like that you are able to take a break and go do something fun for a while<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283862657">Mo has been absolutely sure of a number of things over the years (she&#39;s 9) and then later, without any fuss at all, discovered she was wrong. Or completely forgotten she ever thought differently. Or completely lost interest in the topic. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make a big deal about something that really isn&#39;t. Admire his very real cleverness and vision. Clever, visionary people are frequently wrong - what lets someone realize a vision isn&#39;t certainty, its a willingness to take a chance and learn something along the way. But if you make an issue of having a &quot;right answer&quot; too much of the time, kids can lose that willingness and come to believe its better to be right than imagine something new. <br/>

argument to be won but a theory in the making.  I encourage his theories<br/>
as I think that&#39;s a more important and practical skill than knowing any<br/>
particular detail.  He&#39;ll figure out the details by experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018691006">Just to throw in my two cents - I agree that exploring the concept together is more important than being &#39;right&#39; about it.

I&#39;d ask questions BUT I&#39;d ask in such a way as to show how unnecessary or untenable the concept was.

That experience helped me learn how to interact with DS when he started explaining some idea or invention he had. I&#39;d ask for details (size, shape, color, material, etc) and maybe what had triggered the idea (saw something on TV, part of a videogame, an experience he had, etc) and totally enter into his thought process as much as I could. Sometimes we&#39;d discover that the thing already sort of existed in some form. Sometimes he&#39;d follow his idea for a bit and realize that it was a &#39;dead end&#39; (unwieldy, hard to make, whatever).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407239395">What a great reply--thank you!  And I completely agree, I think being right, correct, whatever is so ingrained in all of us we tend to argue just about everything.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to deschool myself so I may better unschool my son.  <br/>
<br/>
And here is my main problem:  I have a M.Ed. and teacher-certification.  I think I&#39;m at a huge disadvantage because of it.  HA HA!<br/>
