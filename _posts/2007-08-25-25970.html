<div id="ygrps-yiv-323420812">I&#39;m in Fort Collins; we have the UR-FREE yahoo group.  In Boulder  <br/>
there&#39;s the Blue Skies 2 group.<br/>
<br/>
We like to go down to Broomfield and go to that cool indoor pool,  <br/>
can&#39;t remember the name, I get it mixed up with the one in Lafayette.<br/>
<br/>
You could look for unschoolers by posting on the EHCO yahoo group  <br/>
which is a state wide homeschooling list.<br/>

&gt; Do any unschoolers get together out here? I live in a suburb south of<br/>
&gt; Denver. I figure that Denver, or certainly Boulder would have some<br/>
&gt; groups that get together...<br/>

meeting up with some other unschoolers we&#39;ve met at the Live & Learn  <br/>
confs.   So far the plan is to go to Legoland homeschool discount day  <br/>
on Oct 8th, and I think Sea World on the 10th, which may also be a  <br/>
discount day.  You&#39;re welcome to join us.<br/>

Oh, really?! What fun! It&#39;ll be PACKED on that day, but I&#39;d love it! I bet  <br/>
the kids would too. Yes, include me, please! It&#39;s a tad of a drive for us, but  <br/>
that&#39;s ok - we live in Claremont...We can if there are DEF. discounts ;) <br/>
 <br/>
Let&#39;s talk more in the near future, or off list, k? Thanks! <br/>
