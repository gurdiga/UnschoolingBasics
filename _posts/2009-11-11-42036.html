<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172195659">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has received any blank emails from me, please do not open it.  A virus may have affected my email.  I am trying to figure out the source of the problem.  Please bear with me.  I know these blank emails have been sent to some of my recent contacts and groups.  Please delete them if there is no subject line.  I apologize for any inconvenience.  If anyone knows how to fix this problem, by all means, please email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:tvgailo@...">tvgailo@...</a>.<br/>
