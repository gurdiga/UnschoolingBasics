<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931054090">My 6 year old daughter does the same thing and has since she was around<br/>
4.  She has always been unschooled.  I just smile and say yes.  I&#39;m sure<br/>
there is some reason that she does it and if it makes her feel better to<br/>
ask to do things, I am happy to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I do sometimes get frustrated with it still, but I know it&#39;s just part<br/>
of being her.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828085386">Hello Nicole,<br/>
<br/>
I would&#39;t worry about it. My doughter(4) went to school for 3 months and<br/>
sometimes she holds up her hand when she wants to say something.even when<br/>
it&#39;s just the 2 of us.<br/>
<br/>
I just try to let go of it. I founded out that when I can let go she most of<br/>
the times lets go too.<br/>

lovable about her. (Sniffing the top of her head or the back of her <br/>
neck works well in a pinch)  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Then, smile and lovingly say &quot;yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then, even though it can be so frustrating, try to be grateful for <br/>
all the opportunities she gives you to say &quot;yes&quot; to her!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all your choice in how you feel.  You can choose to feel <br/>
frustrated or you can choose to see the beauty and fragility in each <br/>
of those moments.  You&#39;re the only one who can choose your <br/>
feelings.  And, maybe know *that* can help you see what a powerful <br/>
woman you really are.<br/>

she doesn&#39;t really have a sense of what you&#39;re doing and how that <br/>
relates to what&#39;s she&#39;s doing, so she&#39;s asking, to make sure its <br/>
convenient. What do grown-up do when kids aren&#39;t looking at them? <br/>
Could be anything.<br/>

  My younger two kids have never been to school -- or anywhere else they had to ask for everything -- yet they&#39;ve always asked me to do virtually anything they do.  I just say sure, and let it go at that.  <br/>
   <br/>
  It can get to be a bit much, but I figure since I don&#39;t require them to ask, it must be that they value my input, or maybe they just want me to know what they&#39;re doing.  Recently, they&#39;ve moved to telling me what they&#39;re going to do rather than ask, but still, it&#39;s no biggie.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431064378">Both of my kids went to daycare then the public schools.  The 15yo is in his 3rd year homeschooling, and my 11yo is in her first year.  They don&#39;t ask to go to the bathroom, but they do ask about nearly everything else.  &quot;Mom, can I listen to my cd&#39;s?&quot;   &quot;Mom, can I go outside with the dog?&quot;   &quot;Mom, can I sit here by you?&quot;   &quot;Mom, I&#39;m tired. Can I go lay down?&quot;  Like the others, I just answer &quot;Yes&quot; and go on.<br/>
<br/>
The only time it gets to me is when I am lying down for a nap, and the 11yo wakes me to ask if she can use the computer, get a drink, read her library book.....for heaven&#39;s sake the answer is always &quot;Yes!&quot;.....but I just say &quot;Yes&quot; in my normal tone and turn over and try to go back to sleep!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898717008">In our home, our kids were in school for five years before pulling them out and <br/>
unschooling. Even now that we&#39;re deschooled, they still ask for a lot of things. They don&#39;t <br/>
ask as a means of obtaining permission, but it is a way to check in with me. It is also <br/>
important because we&#39;ve had many experiences with someone eating all of the eggs, and <br/>
not having enough to make cookies, or them getting involved with a messy project and <br/>
then needing to quit in the middle to make another engagement that they&#39;ve been looking <br/>
forward. So we&#39;ll say, &quot;Yes, you can have eggs but please leave two for a cookie batch.&quot; It&#39;s <br/>
just common courtesy  in a family! So now my older children don&#39;t ask &#39;Can I&#39; but ask &#39;is <br/>
there a plan for this?&#39;<br/>
As someone else mentioned, be thankful that they are wanting to connect to you, smile, <br/>
and gracefully say &quot;Yes! You can!&quot; It feels good to say Yes so much. Something else, some <br/>
children really chaff at the idea of too much freedom at once, and to them, asking is a way <br/>
to carefully tread the path to new boundaries. Four seems to be an age where they are <br/>
more likely to experiment with those expectations anyway.<br/>
Enjoy it..<br/>

  After posting I thought about it and realized something. Shell often come up to me and say momma Im gonna ask you something.......then she dosent actually ask a question she just tells me something. <br/>
  So I got to thinking and realized her asking is probably meant a lot more like telling me. <br/>
  So today she asked can I play outside ? and in a very sweet voice I said no and she smiled and said yes I can! and I said yes of course you can but Im glad you want to let me know because i want to be outside with you to be sure you are safe.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had a similar &quot;problem&quot; with my daughter (7), when we started unschooling last year in <br/>
august. I thought it was rather clear that she was now allowed to virtually do whatever she <br/>
wanted, and that she didn&#39;t have to ask anymore. One day though, she gave me the answer <br/>
I needed to understand and appreciate her asking. She asked me if she could wear a dress <br/>
(it was winter). I said, yes, of course, you know you don&#39;t have to ask for such a thing... and <br/>
she said &quot;yes, I know but... hm... I kind of wanted to know, if it is &#39;OK&#39; to do it, you know? If <br/>
people outside will laugh about it, or if they will understand it&quot; You see? They are just <br/>
checking out if they are doing things right, if their behaviour fits in with cultural <br/>
&quot;agreements&quot;, traditions and customs. That&#39;s a good thing and another proof, that we can <br/>
totally trust on their abilities to find out everything they want and need to know about the <br/>
world/society we live in :-) <br/>

    To give a short background...most of this year we were having <br/>
extreme family and<br/>
financial troubles . the kids all wanted to go to school and we thought <br/>
it might<br/>
be best for a little while. My youngest 4 was in a preschool program <br/>
for 3 hours<br/>
a day.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So, between school and extreme family and financial issues, your <br/>
children have heard &quot;no&quot; a LOT in their short, short lives.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   My 4 year old constantly asks for every little thing. ive told her <br/>
you dont<br/>
have to ask and she says ok and goes right back to it. So Im wondering <br/>
what you<br/>
guys suggest.<br/>
<br/>
  Can I wash my hands? play in the dirt? get a drink of water? etc etc<br/>
<br/>
   Right now Ive stopped telling her she dosent have to ask because i <br/>
feel like<br/>
Im getting frustrated over it and i just keep saying yes of course you <br/>
can! to<br/>
almost everything.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Maybe they just like hearing &quot;YES!&quot;  ?? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Say it JOYFULLY!  Not just &quot;yes&quot; but &quot;YES YES YES! OF COURSE!!!!!&quot;<br/>
