<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003915654">Hi everyone!  Since we&#39;re such a diverse group of people here I <br/>
thought it a good place to inquire.  Does anyone live in Maine?  Has <br/>
anyone traveled to Maine?  What are the &quot;not to miss&quot; destinations?  I <br/>
do plan to visit Acadia National Park and would love to see puffins.<br/>
<br/>
What about the dining?  Any great restaurants that you recommend?  Pat <br/>
is looking forward to eating lobster while I have been trying to eat a <br/>
more fresh and basic diet.  <br/>
<br/>
The reason I ask is that Pat and I are planning a two week road trip <br/>
for our honeymoon the end of September.  This has been NINE YEARS <br/>
coming, so we are VERY excited.  I&#39;d love to hear anything you have to <br/>
share.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

nice trolley museum in Kennebunk if you like that stuff. Of course, <br/>
you have to get the lobster or at least some New England clam chowder. <br/>
Hmm September is a little late for peak season for some things - and <br/>
great time for others - and a little early for still others (like the <br/>
glorious foliage of October). There used to be a small chain of <br/>
restaurants called Road Kill Cafe up there that is a fun place to eat. <br/>
Food and price are reasonable but what&#39;s fun is that they rename <br/>
stuff - like you can get a plate of &#39;lugnuts&#39; as an appetizer (stuffed <br/>
mushrooms I think it was) and the specials of the day are &quot;whatever <br/>
they caught in the swamp out back&quot; and &quot;whatever they scraped off the <br/>
road out front&quot;. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re still in business (it&#39;s been <br/>
several years since we visited ME). Oh and there was a wonderful <br/>
romantic restaurant right on the waterfront in Portland - big picture <br/>
windows, floor to ceiling, let you look west over the water at the <br/>
skyline and the sunset as you eat a romantic dinner for two. Can&#39;t <br/>
remember the name off hand (we ate there on our honeymoon 12 years ago <br/>
this October).<br/>

We live in MA and LOVE Maine (we&#39;re going camping near Lake Sebago the <br/>
last week of Aug).  I especially love Boothbay Harbor (friends own a <br/>
B&B there).  When I was growing up my parents had a boat and we went <br/>
every summer for three weeks, in and out of their craggy coastline, I <br/>
LOVED it! (camping on the ocean).  There are SO many good places to <br/>
eat, especially if you love seafood.  We (my family now, not when I was <br/>
a kid) didn&#39;t liked Camden (the people were snotty, and the atmosphere <br/>
was too &quot;upper crust&quot; for us.   Where are you from and where are you <br/>
starting your road trip in Maine?<br/>
<br/>
You can email me off list if you would rather.<br/>

We&#39;re celebrating our 14th this Oct 12!  We were going to go to Maine, <br/>
but as you said, it&#39;s post season and decided on Disney in FL instead <br/>
(had a blast, I know some don&#39;t like Disney.....)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This year, we&#39;re celebrating by packing up our gear to head out to <br/>
the Live and Learn conference. We hit the road bright and early the <br/>
day after our anniversary. I&#39;m thinking we&#39;ll probably let DS stay <br/>
with Grandma overnight a few weeks before that and spend a night off <br/>
somewhere alone.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, we prefer the off season for most things (and Disney would <br/>
be a waste for me since most of the rides cause motion sickness - <br/>
I&#39;m the designated &#39;stuff holder&#39; when we go to carnivals - we even <br/>
pay for admission and food and stuff for SIL to come along to take <br/>
DS on rides).<br/>
<br/>
BTW If anyone is in the area or traveling through and has a day or <br/>
two free, Sept 16-Oct 2 is the Big E New England &quot;state&quot; Fair. Lots <br/>
of rides, food, animals, specialties from all the New England States <br/>
and a big Mardi Gras parade every evening. It&#39;s at the Eastern <br/>
States Exposition a stone&#39;s throw from 6 Flags New England in MA <br/>
(just over the border from CT). If you google Big E you should find <br/>
it.<br/>

on our own private island--sigh. Heaven! We could paddle around in the <br/>
canoe, then head back to the island, sit by the fire...<br/>
<br/>
If you ever go to my main page, the just me part, that&#39;s me hiking at <br/>
Baxter.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the back country sites is on an island by itself, but you pretty <br/>
much have to enjoy hiking to get there. As I recall it was a 12 mile <br/>
hike. I think we broke it up on the way in but hiked it all out. The B&B <br/>
we stayed at that night, &quot;The Lake House,&quot; was absolutely wonderful and <br/>
had some of the best food I&#39;ve ever eaten in my life.<br/>

*****************************************<br/>
I lived in Maine for ten years, and Julian was born there.<br/>
Spend some time in Portland. It&#39;s a wonderful little city with amazing  <br/>
restaurants and art. The art museum is incredible. DeMillo&#39;s Restaurant is  really <br/>
only okay, but it&#39;s a floating restaurant in a boat, so it&#39;s pretty  cool.<br/>
 <br/>
Bar Harbor and Acadia are my favorite places on earth. DEFINITELY eat at  <br/>
Jordan&#39;s Pond in the park. Food is delicious and it&#39;s very romantic. The whale  <br/>
watches and other ranger-led boat trips are great.<br/>
 <br/>
E-mail me with any more questions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913300303">Hi!  I mostly lurk, but I have to weigh in on this, since I lived in Bar Harbor for 5 years, just moved down the coast and inland about 1 1/2 years ago.  <br/>
 <br/>
When you&#39;re in Bar Harbor, check out the Morning Glory Bakery.  It&#39;s on Rodick Street, just off the main drag.  Just ask anyone to point you in the right direction.  They make absolutely everything from scratch (even their croissants and granola).  People who find it towards the end of their stay are always sorry they didn&#39;t find it sooner.  <br/>
 <br/>
The Balance Rock in is right there in town in one of the old &quot;cottages&quot; from days of yore and has a spectacular view right on the sea.  You can easily stroll into town.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.balancerockinn.com/welcomebri.htm">http://www.balancerockinn.com/welcomebri.htm</a>  The Nannau is closed for the season, but I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t mention it for future reference.  I&#39;ve always wanted to stay there.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nannau.com/index.html">http://www.nannau.com/index.html</a><br/>
 <br/>
The Burning Tree in Otter Creek:  this is such a great secret, since it&#39;s not right in town.  It&#39;s super-casual (island Maine-style) in an old small house, use their own organic vegetables, specialize in seafood (Elmer smokes his own salmon yummmmmmmm).  I used to wait tables there and I&#39;ve waited on Brooke Astor, random Rockefellers, and seen **Martha** who has a home nearby.  Plus all my tatooed friends.  I recommend everything.<br/>
 <br/>
And to keep this ON TOPIC, Back in Bar Harbor do this:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.divered.com/index.html">http://www.divered.com/index.html</a>  Diver Ed&#39;s Dive-in Theater.  I&#39;d pay money just to hang out with Eddie Monet.  I mean it.  <br/>
 <br/>
and if it rains, go to Reel Pizza and watch a movie, drink a beer and eat pizza.<br/>
 <br/>
Have Fun! <br/>
Liza Rose<br/>
