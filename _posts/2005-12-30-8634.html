I&#39;d love to get some folks here involved, but couldn&#39;t find info. on<br/>
the next one. Will you keep us informed if you hear anything?  It&#39;s a<br/>
really cool idea. Thanks for sharing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-721573412">Thanks Ren!  I guess I was a little careless with that link - that&#39;s what<br/>
happens when I post late in the evening.  I&#39;ll try to catch the info on the<br/>
next one.<br/>

This is the address submissions were previously directed toward:<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that they will at least know about the next one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-167317250">Perhaps there needs to be a &quot;carnival of radical unschooling.&quot; I  <br/>
visited that carnival a few days ago, and some of the links didn&#39;t  <br/>
strike me as especially good examples of unschooling--like the woman  <br/>
who called in an &quot;unschooling day&quot; when her carefully structured  <br/>
plans for her kids&#39; education fell apart for some reason. Or this,  <br/>
from the &quot;explaining what we do all day&quot; post:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The day after Halloween is the day the children get all the candy  <br/>
out of their bags they want, all day, Milky Way after Skittles, after  <br/>
KitKat, after Reece&#39;s after Pixie Sticks, for tomorrow, what they did  <br/>
not gorge on today, goes away. Helps me not have to regulate it from  <br/>
now til Easter.&quot;<br/>

It&#39;s not unschooling but you can still submit unschooling posts. <br/>

Sorry it took me so long to come back to this email - it really caught me by<br/>
surprise!  I would gladly participate in an unschooling carnival, but head<br/>
one up?  I wouldn&#39;t have thought of ME first!  I&#39;ve only been blogging for<br/>
about five months and really only about a third of my posts are even about<br/>
homeschooling let alone unschooling!  Danielle&#39;s been blogging far longer<br/>
than I and incidentally has better name recognition as well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying I wouldn&#39;t do it, I&#39;m just checking to see if I&#39;m the best<br/>
choice for the job.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, trying to confuse my poor addled brain with the whole <br/>
Danielle, Daniel thing again aren&#39;t you? I&#39;m sure it&#39;s amusing.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I&#39;ll be happy to have either of you witty people head it up. <br/>
It&#39;s not like I have any say over this matter...I&#39;m just really good <br/>
at coming up with ideas for other people. <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem like it would take up that much time, but maybe I <br/>
don&#39;t know enough about how to pull one off.  If anyone wants to <br/>
volunteer, that would be great. I think you&#39;d be a fabulous RU <br/>
carnival organizer Daniel.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you have to pass some blog test of experience to run a <br/>
carnival.;) I&#39;m a new blogger myself, only posting regularly in the <br/>
last couple of months. Ooh, I joined a blog ring though! Hoping to <br/>
inspire myself to keep writing more.<br/>
