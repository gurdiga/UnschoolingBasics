<div id="ygrps-yiv-713820301">&quot;I love my husband and don&#39;t want to be divorced over this, I don&#39;t<br/>
know what to do.  I&#39;ve stood my ground but what good does it do when<br/>
DS cares so much about what his dad says?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, divorce would be much more harmful to them than schoolish stuff<br/>
in this case.:)<br/>
BUT, is there any way you can get to a conference this year? I&#39;ve seen<br/>
many Dad &quot;conversions&quot; there. <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t heard great things about the &quot;Grown without Schooling&quot; video<br/>
thus far. Cameron Lovejoy is working on a radical unschooling<br/>
documentary video I believe (can you give us an update Kelly?).<br/>
<br/>
I just explained the situation to my dh and asked him what will help a<br/>
guy like your dh, that is so stuck in schoolish thinking. He said &quot;two<br/>
things; time and patience&quot;:)<br/>
Not so easy when time is of the essence. He said it was baby steps for<br/>
him.  I can definitely agree with that!<br/>

I agree, so if he still doesn&#39;t get it after reading my &#39;book&#39; perhaps<br/>
I&#39;m better off with relaxed schooling and just sticking with it<br/>
because this back and forth shit is not healthy at all.<br/>

Sadly, no, his vacation days are going to be swooped up with our<br/>
family that is spread out between VA, MI and TX and the children are<br/>
begging to go to Las Vegas and see their friends who moved there about<br/>
a year and a half ago.<br/>

Thanks for asking your DH, Ren.  I agree with you two also. I&#39;m tired<br/>
of not being heard, tired of not being trusted, tired of Zak being<br/>
pulled one way and another.  Why is it that it seems the majority of<br/>
moms actually look into things concerning their children whereas Dads<br/>
don&#39;t (that is an in &#39;general&#39; comment from reading many other posts<br/>
concerning DH&#39;s)? <br/>

<br/>
Heck fire and tarnation yes, let&#39;s keep some perspective!  Divorce is<br/>
nasty bad on kids and then, the kids would still be around their dad part<br/>
of the time and around him without you there as buffer, support, comfort.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t this dad say he&#39;d trust the mom on this issue?   If I&#39;m thinking<br/>
of the right dad, how about asking him one thing.   When he&#39;s about to<br/>
say something school or learning related, ask him to take a deep breath<br/>
and say instead,  &quot;cool, I hope you have fun.&quot;  Or something.   At first<br/>
he&#39;ll forget.   Then he&#39;ll remember but he&#39;ll remember AFTER he&#39;s said<br/>
the schooly thing.   Then, with any luck, he&#39;ll remember just before it<br/>
comes out his mouth and he&#39;ll stop himself.   <br/>
<br/>
If he won&#39;t read then keep talking to him, but let it be in little<br/>
snippets and not in an &quot;I&#39;m here to educate you&quot; kind of way but in the<br/>
way you&#39;d share any interesting thing with him.  Let your own<br/>
conversations with your kids be an example to him of happy, stress free<br/>
communication. <br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t have to understand it all right now in order to stop causing<br/>
stress.  Just help him and yourselves over this one thing at this time,<br/>
if you can. <br/>
<br/>
Has he read Rue&#39;s book?  Maybe ask him to read that.  &quot;Parenting a Free<br/>
Child: An Unschooled Life&quot; by Rue Kream <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freechild.info/">http://www.freechild.info/</a><br/>

You and the kids don&#39;t have to change what you&#39;re doing. You feel good  about <br/>
it. The kids are starting to get it.  It&#39;s okay if in a friendly way  you <br/>
express that Dad doesn&#39;t understand unschooling yet, so he&#39;s going to need  time.<br/>
 <br/>
In the meantime, don&#39;t worry about his getting unschooling -- help him  <br/>
figure out ways to communicate with the kids that won&#39;t make the kids feel  <br/>
squashed. I&#39;d ask him to read something like &quot;Liberated Parents, Liberated  Children&quot; <br/>
or  &quot;How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will  Talk&quot; by Faber <br/>
and Mazlish.<br/>
 <br/>
The thing about all this stuff is that it can be scary! Your husband was  <br/>
psyched when your son had this goal because it made him feel safe.  He  could <br/>
tell people that his 12 year old son was studying because he wants to  finish <br/>
high school and go to college early. He WILL get it, but he needs time to  see it <br/>
in action. Think about it....you&#39;ve read here for a long time, and just  NOW <br/>
you&#39;ve become passionate. <br/>
 <br/>
Ask him to look for stuff that your kids are doing that seem cool, or to  <br/>
find things that they can do together that will be fun. Ask him to be gentle in  <br/>
his communications with them. Tell him you&#39;ll try to be patient as he goes  <br/>
through HIS process.<br/>
 <br/>
I suspect your son&#39;s interest in the GED was a kind of Prodigy Complex. He  <br/>
liked the idea of entering college really, really young...that would seem  <br/>
impressive!  He might be a kid who would really like a big, flashy project  that <br/>
could get him a lot of attention. That&#39;s not a bad thing. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s going to be okay. He sounds like he&#39;s a nice guy who adores his kids,  <br/>
and you. Changes, good, bad, big, little can be challenging. Don&#39;t worry.<br/>

It is, unfortunately, a very general thing with men.  When women are pregnant they will read all kinds of books and such; men will not.  Women feel very connected to their children from the start - mostly because we are carrying them.  I think men always feel &quot;late to the party&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Also, men tend to be very &#39;logical&#39; beings, and so they are more apt to stick with what works.  Women will sway with the changing needs of their children.  My husband always says women are like the seasons and men are like time - and it&#39;s true.  And both work really well together.  It just takes time for a man to see certain things that are outside of his realm of &quot;expertise&quot;.  But, given time, it&#39;s possible for them to come around and understand.<br/>
<br/>
Be true to RU, take your time with it.  Don&#39;t force it on your husband just as you wouldn&#39;t force workbooks on your kids.  Allow him to share in the fun and the living, and continue to talk to him about it.  Talk to your children too, and help them to understand (as someone else said) that it will take time for dad to &#39;get it&#39;, but that he loves them just the same.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is s-l-o-w-l-y coming around, bit by bit.  He (like many men) likes to feel in control of situations, and unschooling can look and feel very out of control.  He&#39;s learning to let go of the &quot;that&#39;s not how it was done in my house&quot; and &quot;I wasn&#39;t like that as a child&quot; etc, etc (sigh), and he&#39;s enjoying his children much more.<br/>
<br/>
Ask your husband why he wanted to have children.  Was it just to have little people mimick him?  Or was it to enjoy watching them unfold and learn about life.  Did he have children to say &quot;yes, I have children&quot; or did he have children to watch someone else&#39;s spirit blossom, and to be a guide and facilitator for that spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, word that in a very non-judgmental way, and in a way that your particular husband will understand....and good luck with it.<br/>
