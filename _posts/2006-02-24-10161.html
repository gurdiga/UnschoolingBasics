<div id="ygrps-yiv-646821974">I totally agree, *high* sugar intake isn&#39;t healthy. But given the  <br/>
freedom, children really do choose a healthier diet over time. I know  <br/>
that all of my eating issues are caused by my mother, who did not  <br/>
allow any kind of snacks, sweets or junk food. My brother and I used  <br/>
to sit and daydream about when we&#39;d get some. What about emotional  <br/>
damage? I am also concerned that many of Dr Mercola&#39;s sources are  <br/>
outdated, esp the ones that are 50 to 60 years old.  I&#39;d like to know  <br/>
what the definition of excessive is, is there a link that states  <br/>
that? At the top it says that &quot;excess sugar *may* cause the  <br/>
following:&quot;. I really don&#39;t think that eating a normal amount of  <br/>
sweets, combined with a relatively balanced diet, is poor nutrition.<br/>

about sugar. Body needs some to build brain and energy...I think  <br/>
there&#39;s probably more to worry about in all the chemicals that junk  <br/>
food has....but it&#39;s all about balance. And letting kids find their  <br/>
own rather than dictating.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the good conversation....and for the link. I do like  <br/>

to my parents!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014157474">Not going to flame you for sure. However, you are giving a LOT of power<br/>
to electronics which I haven&#39;t seen to be there with my never limited<br/>
almost 9 yr old DS. Yes, he loves his Gameboy, he loves his favorite TV<br/>
programs and computer and video games. He ALSO loves running around<br/>
playing with toilet paper tubes and sticks and marbles and making rivers<br/>
and dams with the garden hose and dirt and rocks and such and making<br/>
snowballs and sledding and jumping through a lawn sprinkler and swimming<br/>
and canoeing and making ramps for his little vehicles and watching mud<br/>
dauber wasps find exactly the right kind of nest mud and picking fresh<br/>
wild blackberries from the brambles in the back of the yard on a fine<br/>
early summer morning. I will say he tends to dislike crayons mostly - he<br/>
prefers fine point markers, pens, and the like to the fat, imprecision<br/>
of crayons. Just his own personality - he loves making detailed line<br/>
drawings over making colorful fanciful drawings, just his way, which we<br/>
honor by making sure he&#39;s got plenty of such pens and markers and lots<br/>
of spiral bound sketchbooks (they tend to lay flatter and are easier to<br/>
manage than perfect bound stuff). When there is no more power ascribed<br/>
to TV than to a piece of colorful ribbon, it is a FREE choice to<br/>
interact with either, or BOTH. He&#39;s just as content to have the<br/>
electronics off and play cards or a board game, precisely BECAUSE he<br/>
knows it is a FREE choice  which he can take up at any time and leave at<br/>
any time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631411117">Without knowing the players, it sounds like &quot;I wish your children were as polite and quiet as you were.&quot; I think this is very common not only in unschooling families, but in most every family in which a grandparent is unable to exercise the same measure of control over the grandkids that they exercised over their own children. It&#39;s frustrating for a grandparent to see the benefits to a child of different parenting styles than the ones they exercised, partly because (particularly in unschooling) it can be hard to have faith that the grandkids will be &quot;successful.&quot; <br/>

I would suggest seeing grandma and grandpa either at your house, where the kids are familiar and comfortable, or somewhere neutral where they can run around and blow off steam, like a playground, water park,camping, etc.  Expecting kids to be calm and obedient at G&G&#39;s house will only stress EVERYONE out ;)<br/>

 <br/>
We have found that many &quot;unsupporting&quot; people aren&#39;t unsupportive maliciously; for the most part, they just really want to connect with the child but find that the traditional routes to connection (&quot;What grade are you in?&quot;, &quot;What are you learning?&quot;) are now closed. If you think about it, most of us (and a number of preceding generations) were raised and &quot;schooled&#39; in some basics - naming Presidents and state capitols, knowing the dates of wars, The Mayflower, yada yada. While these are all trivial pursuits, they do give us a common frame of reference, a connection point, that allows us entry into deeper conversation. Most of us were raised that way, for good or bad, and continue to work that way today.<br/>
<br/>
Grandparents are no different; they are using their tried and true methods for connecting. The problem is that our kids don&#39;t know the answers to these trivial questions, don&#39;t know what they&#39;ve &quot;learned&quot; in a day, etc. So rather than acknowledge that they need to find a different way to connect (which means undoing years of programming), our relatives will ask our children to change so they can connect. And if that doesn&#39;t work, they&#39;ll question unschooling in an effort to get us to change, all so that they can connect with our kids. This paradigm holds a very might sway.<br/>
<br/>
But at it&#39;s heart, I think that most time this behavior comes from a place of good (trying to connect) rather than a place of bad. So we try to help them find other ways to connect - suggesting questions the grandparents can ask that will lead to enjoyable conversations, providing background info on our children&#39;s interests rather than on unschooling, and ensuring they get up-to-date info on what our kids are into at that particular point in time. The goal of this is simple - I don&#39;t need my parents to &quot;get&quot; unschooling, I need them to &quot;get&quot; their grandkids. Once that happens, a lot of the worry melts away - - -and many of the criticisms with it, because they no longer have a problem to solve. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122323351">The comment was made at a park after taking a walk. I thought the kids  <br/>
were fine. We stopped visiting their house about two years ago. They  <br/>
were ok to my children before my nephew was born. Grammy had the  <br/>
opportunity to watch F several days a week including an overnight. She  <br/>
stopped being nice to me children and started treating them less than.  <br/>
So we stopped visiting. Last year we met them at NEU hoping they would  <br/>
stay but they didn&#39;t. They don&#39;t approve of our unschooling though  <br/>
before F they made comments about what sweet, smart, thoughtful  <br/>
children they were. They hardly acknowledge the baby when they visit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just as soon write them off as I did my father/step-mother. But DH  <br/>
wants some conact. We are visiting the whole extended family in a few  <br/>
weeks. Everyone one else is wonderful. We plan to do a bunch of beach  <br/>
going, bike riding, kayaking etc so we won&#39;t be around them too much.  <br/>
I just get anxiuos and high strung when u think about being around them.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would suggest seeing grandma and grandpa either at your house,  <br/>
&gt; where the kids are familiar and comfortable, or somewhere neutral  <br/>
&gt; where they can run around and blow off steam, like a playground,  <br/>
&gt; water park,camping, etc.  Expecting kids to be calm and obedient at  <br/>
&gt; G&G&#39;s house will only stress EVERYONE out ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828219789">That was great Jeff. Much appreciated insight. It&#39;s hard to turn it  <br/>
around when it&#39;s in your own head :-)<br/>
<br/>
It gives me the idea of writing them a nice email saying something  <br/>
about getting it that it can be difficult fir them to find ways to  <br/>
connect since our kids aren&#39;t schooled and offering them ideas about  <br/>
their interests. I can just send a detailed note about each kid, where  <br/>
they have been or our going recently, what their passions are, what  <br/>
they ate reading or watching.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have found that many &quot;unsupporting&quot; people aren&#39;t unsupportive  <br/>
&gt; maliciously; for the most part, they just really want to connect  <br/>
&gt; with the child but find that the traditional routes to connection  <br/>
&gt; (&quot;What grade are you in?&quot;, &quot;What are you learning?&quot;) are now closed.  <br/>
&gt; If you think about it, most of us (and a number of preceding  <br/>
&gt; generations) were raised and &quot;schooled&#39; in some basics - naming  <br/>
&gt; Presidents and state capitols, knowing the dates of wars, The  <br/>
&gt; Mayflower, yada yada. While these are all trivial pursuits, they do  <br/>
&gt; give us a common frame of reference, a connection point, that allows  <br/>
&gt; us entry into deeper conversation. Most of us were raised that way,  <br/>
&gt; for good or bad, and continue to work that way today.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Grandparents are no different; they are using their tried and true  <br/>
&gt; methods for connecting. The problem is that our kids don&#39;t know the  <br/>
&gt; answers to these trivial questions, don&#39;t know what they&#39;ve  <br/>
&gt; &quot;learned&quot; in a day, etc. So rather than acknowledge that they need  <br/>
&gt; to find a different way to connect (which means undoing years of  <br/>
&gt; programming), our relatives will ask our children to change so they  <br/>
&gt; can connect. And if that doesn&#39;t work, they&#39;ll question unschooling  <br/>
&gt; in an effort to get us to change, all so that they can connect with  <br/>
&gt; our kids. This paradigm holds a very might sway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But at it&#39;s heart, I think that most time this behavior comes from a  <br/>
&gt; place of good (trying to connect) rather than a place of bad. So we  <br/>
&gt; try to help them find other ways to connect - suggesting questions  <br/>
&gt; the grandparents can ask that will lead to enjoyable conversations,  <br/>
&gt; providing background info on our children&#39;s interests rather than on  <br/>
&gt; unschooling, and ensuring they get up-to-date info on what our kids  <br/>
&gt; are into at that particular point in time. The goal of this is  <br/>
&gt; simple - I don&#39;t need my parents to &quot;get&quot; unschooling, I need them  <br/>
&gt; to &quot;get&quot; their grandkids. Once that happens, a lot of the worry  <br/>
&gt; melts away - - -and many of the criticisms with it, because they no  <br/>
&gt; longer have a problem to solve.<br/>

<br/>
Allow me to respond to your anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
Could you just imagine the following?<br/>
<br/>
In your beautiful mind weave a fishing net of rose (pink) coloured strands intersped with golden filaments. When the net is done throw it out over all the people you feel anxious about and just let it go and let it be.<br/>
<br/>

PS the rose coloured net with the golden filaments come from Rebecca Marina at EFTExpert.com. It is currently helping me a lot with quite mundane anxieties already.<br/>

there to visit (after saying hellos) and tell the in-laws that you saw a<br/>

looking forward to checking out...and take them there. Rather than<br/>
trying to compress them to fit in the tiny space of their house (and it<br/>
can be tiny even if it&#39;s 5000 sq ft), find ways to let them burn energy<br/>
on a regular basis throughout the day. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41940592">A steady stream of doing and being stuff for the grandparents is really<br/>
helpful, especially when they&#39;ve got multiple sets of grandkids and set<br/>
A is doing soccer and set B just won an academic award or two and so on.<br/>
Even though my folks are great (and think DS is wonderful just as he<br/>
is), it can be hard when they don&#39;t see him often to know what to use to<br/>
connect - so I make sure to send pix and emails and phone calls with<br/>
tidbits of daily life. That way, they can ask him about the submarine he<br/>
visited, or the toads in the back yard, or whatever. I also try to throw<br/>
in references to the TV shows, movies, videogames he currently enjoys -<br/>
for instance, right now he LOVES the old MASH episodes (we have the<br/>
whole season on DVD) and my dad and I used to watch MASH together all<br/>
the time (along with the rest of the family). That&#39;s a point of<br/>
connection - DS can actually reel off whole sections of dialog! It helps<br/>
them when he starts talking about Pikachu or &quot;robucks&quot; or sackboy to<br/>
know that he&#39;s referring to videogames (Pokemon, Roblox, Little Big<br/>
Planet respectively) - they may not play games or have a lot of interest<br/>
in them themselves BUT they can at least ask questions that make sense<br/>
and converse about it because I&#39;ve mentioned it along the way.<br/>

This got me thinking that maybe the kids are sensitive to your  <br/>
anxiety.   I know that when I am nervous about something my kids  <br/>
usually pick up on it.  It is like a warning signal to them that  <br/>
something is amiss.   No matter what other things you try, if you can  <br/>
practice being calm and happy, not anticipating problems.  Focus on  <br/>
your children and their needs and their happiness and block out as  <br/>
much negativity  as you can.  You may find they will be themselves  <br/>
more.  Who knows, your happy demeanor may even rub off on your in  <br/>
laws.  At the very least you will have a better vacation that way.<br/>

There will be plenty of new slights to get upset about. :)<br/>
