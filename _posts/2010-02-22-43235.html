 </span></blockquote>One week is not enough time to make a difference. : -)  I can say with complete confidence that you can let them watch TV as much as they want. They will self-regulate once watching TV gets old and boring. My older girls 8, 5, & almost 3 requested a TV Free day. Last night, my 5 year old asked if we could start having TV free Tuesdays. I said sure and didn&#39;t think anything about it. When we got up this morning, my almost 3 year old ask me to turn off the TV and turn the radio on instead. Normally, we have the TV on pretty much 24/7. They turn it off or go in other rooms and play. The TV isn&#39;t a big deal to them. Kids need time to adjust when you start removing limits.<br/>

Okay, brace yourself - let them watch as much as they want. You don&#39;t have to tell them you&#39;re doing that, just say yes when they ask for tv, and when they ask for &quot;one more&quot; - keep saying yes. Have other things available, fun things, but expect them to watch a lot of tv for awhile. Its natural for people to want thing that have been limited! Its part of what makes something a treat or luxury item - its a limited commodity. <br/>
<br/>
That wasn&#39;t what you wanted to hear, was it? Once kids stop thinking of tv as a luxury item, then other fun things will be more appealing, they&#39;ll be able to choose to do something else.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, it can help to plan some outings that start early in the day to give you all a bit of a break. It also helps a whole lot for you to learn a little tv etiquette - don&#39;t ask kids to change gears in the middle of a show, wait for the end. Also, it can help to make conversation during a commercial, rather than in the middle of a show. That kind of etiquette will save fighting! No-one likes to be interrupted in the middle of something. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-871197469">Watch -with- them or go do something else for your own self - that<br/>
knitting project or that novel or the yoga DVD that&#39;s been gathering<br/>
dust...sitting there stewing over them not doing educational looking<br/>
stuff isn&#39;t going to be helpful. Given their ages, they probably need<br/>
your assistance to find when programs they want to see are on. Go<br/>
-looking- for them and help them access those programs. Go to the<br/>
library and see if there are related books (Arthur and other cartoons<br/>
have a series of books as well). Are there foods you can prepare that<br/>
are similar to what Little Bear is eating? And so on. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To put it in a slightly different perspective: if your kids were sitting<br/>
around all day reading or writing poetry, would you have the same<br/>
problem? Think about why. TV is considered &#39;bad&#39; and &#39;a waste of time&#39;<br/>
while reading is &#39;good&#39; and &#39;educational&#39;. But these days, TV can take<br/>
you more places, more clearly than books in many cases and<br/>
*particularly* for those whose learning style leans toward visual and<br/>
auditory - they NEED to see color and movement and hear the sounds, the<br/>
printed page isn&#39;t their primary means of absorbing information.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, what -else- are they doing? I know very few young ones who are<br/>
sitting totally still watching TV for hours at a time. There&#39;s often<br/>
other forms of play happening in parallel to what is on - whether<br/>
they&#39;re acting out the characters and scenes or whether they&#39;re<br/>
drawing/coloring or building with Legos or whatever, odds are there is<br/>
other stuff going on that is getting lost in the fear of TV.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If they&#39;re used to tv being limited they might just watch, especially at first. Morgan is amazing at multi-tasking while watching tv, but when she&#39;s watching something new she usually focuses pretty intently. When kids aren&#39;t used to having lots of tv access, then a whole lot of things are new - and if they&#39;re not sure how long all this wonderful tv access is going to last they may be trying to soak up every last moment. <br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s something else to look at, too - Are there other things to do in the same room? If your house is pretty tidy, and the tv is separate from &quot;play areas&quot; that will get in the way of kids playing while the tv is on. <br/>
