<br/>
Flamingos are especially interesting because they only mate in years when <br/>
conditions seem right for a successful nest.  And the males display in <br/>
groups  kind of like a Mr. Universe competition.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Since both parents attend the nest and feed the young, even after young <br/>
flamingos can feed themselves, there are advantages to mating with a male <br/>
who obviously is getting the good food.  First, he can show you where it is, <br/>
next, he can supply better food for your offspring, and finally he can show <br/>
your maturing offspring where to find the better food.<br/>
<br/>
Since Flamingos breed in large colonies I&#39;ve always thought it would be much <br/>
easier to find your own nest again if you could spot your (brightly colored) <br/>
mate quickly, but this from a woman who loses her car in parking lots. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
