<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249750792">Thank you for the website regarding home education in Idaho.  I am <br/>
concerned because this is the jist of what the law says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The parent or guardian of any child resident in this state who has <br/>
attained the age of seven (7) years at the time of the commencement of <br/>
school in his district, but not the age of sixteen (16) years, shall <br/>
cause the child to be instructed in subjects commonly and usually <br/>
taught in the public schools of the state of Idaho.&quot; The generally <br/>
accepted subjects are: English, math, reading, science, history and <br/>
civics. <br/>
<br/>
Idaho Code title 33, section 202 - &quot;... Unless the child is otherwise <br/>
comparably instructed the parent or guardian shall cause the child to <br/>
attend a public, private or parochial school...&quot; NOTE: If the child <br/>
is &quot;otherwise comparably instructed&quot; (which includes home education), <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TO ME, this sounds like I need to be using a curriculum or at least <br/>
noting how I am instructing them.  However, I do know that there are <br/>
some unschooling families in Idaho.  They don&#39;t speak up much on any <br/>
chatlists and I don&#39;t know of an Unschooling group.  Maybe this is why <br/>
they keep a low profile.  I am just wondering about how open I should <br/>
be to others in admitting that I unschool.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Does the law say you have to provide proof of instruction, or show anyone <br/>
your child&#39;s work or provide the details of your instruction method?<br/>
If not then you don&#39;t have to note how you instruct them.<br/>
<br/>
Montana law says something similar.  But we are not required to provide <br/>
information about curriculum or instruction and the school authorities have <br/>
no legal right to ask.   So it&#39;s not as if they have the legal power to make <br/>
you prove you&#39;re using a curriculum or as Montana law states, &quot;an organized <br/>
course of study.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The law says your kids must cover subjects taught in school.<br/>
I think you can be fairly confident at some point during the year your kids <br/>
will come across something that could be classified under the categories <br/>
listed in your state law.<br/>
<br/>
I found this link to support group information in Idaho.   You can probably <br/>
find other unschooling families to talk with.<br/>

You don&#39;t have to be afraid.  Other families are happily unschooling in <br/>
every state.  I&#39;m in Montana but you can email me off list if you think I <br/>
could be of any help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271101170">I&#39;m in Florida.  I just re-read the county&#39;s requirements and yes, I need to keep a file of &quot;proof of learning&quot; I&#39;ll call it, along with what&#39;s taught for two years.  I&#39;m not really all that concerned as my son is already at eight, reading better then most high school graduates.  He qualifies for the &quot;gifted&quot; program but the teacher was a nasty woman.  I have given him freedom to learn what he loves and he is growing by leaps and bounds.  I will still have to have him do the stupid FCAT (it really is a poor test) or have an evaluator come in for a yearly report of his progress.  So curently, I&#39;m just saving ALL his projects, pictures, stories and games he has created.<br/>
If he gets a good evaluation or good score on the FCAT (or similiar test)  I don&#39;t think they will bother to look further.  So on that note, I guess I&#39;m not completely free to totally unschool as I&#39;ll need to show proof.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012748485">IL law is very similar, too.  We don&#39;t have any reporting to do.  And you<br/>
can cover those *requirements* in other ways besides a curriculum.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473995158">*****However, I do know that there are<br/>
some unschooling families in Idaho. They don&#39;t speak up much on any<br/>
chatlists and I don&#39;t know of an Unschooling group.*****<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Idaho and drive a vehicle with seven unschooling bumper stickers <br/>
proudly displayed....we are in town regularly in our tie dye L&L <br/>
shirts....nobody hiding out here and we have no problem in discussing <br/>
our lifestyle with anyone who asks.<br/>

There are probably more unschoolers than you think.  Why don&#39;t you<br/>
start a local Unschooling group for your area?   You may be surpised<br/>
who comes out of the woodwork!  Many people who joined the above group<br/>
were quietly hanging out in the big School-At-Home Religious<br/>
Homeschooler organization up here and were very greatful to finally<br/>
have a place they could call home.  :)<br/>
