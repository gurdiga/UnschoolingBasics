&lt;&lt;I always hesitate to bring the screw-ups here. I realize that my life<br/>
can seem sooo perfect when I write.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree with this. I know I might get flack for this but here<br/>
goes...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the type of person (so with my opinion I only speak for myself)<br/>
that thrives on the positivity of what I could be doing better,<br/>
rather than focusing on what mistakes I&#39;ve made. I&#39;ve found in groups<br/>
where people talk a lot about what they are doing wrong it tends to<br/>
stay focused on that and excuses having to do better.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Kendrah, that&#39;s EXACTLY why we choose to show our *best* sides. If <br/>
readers think we never screw up, they&#39;re not really *thinking*! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like to focus on the positive too. Around here, we call &quot;mistakes&quot; <br/>
&quot;LEARNING-TAKES&quot;---which is what they really are. But it&#39;s better to <br/>
move in the *better* direction all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Misery loves company and all that---it&#39;s just too easy to sink into &quot;I <br/>
screwed up---aGAIN!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So much better to say, &quot;I did a *little* better this time. If I&#39;m <br/>
aware, I can do *much* better next time!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s rare that there&#39;s SUCH an OBVIOUS malfunction as we had in <br/>
Minnesota; that&#39;s why I brought that here. The smaller ones are so <br/>
small and rare as to almost be inconsequential anymore.---Not that they <br/>
aren&#39;t addressed here at home, but they aren&#39;t &quot;newsworthy.&quot; &lt;g&gt; But it <br/>
only got that way with lots and lots of trial and error and, well, <br/>
learning-takes. And my and Duncan&#39;s personalities are so different (Ben <br/>
says they are the same! &lt;G&gt;) that we&#39;re still learning that dance.<br/>
<br/>
It takes work, but with just a deep breath, a little thinking, and some <br/>
empathy, we can BE better parents. A few extra tools (like the one you <br/>
just picked up from Ren) don&#39;t hurt! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

I needed to hear this today. Badly. <br/>
 <br/>
I had a HORENDOUS day yesterday, where I wound up screaming at both the  <br/>
children and being a huge pain in the rump. I was arbitrary, annoying and  cranky. <br/>
And being an ass - please excuse my &quot;French.&quot; ;)<br/>
 <br/>
Julian (almost 5) comes to me and says, &quot;You need a hug.&quot; We hugged. It  <br/>
helped for a moment or two, more than I realized, because all of the sudden, I  <br/>
was able to say, &quot;Oh, who cares about this laundry/water poured out of the  <br/>
bath/massive ants/my depressive issues...let&#39;s lay here and watch Oobie before  <br/>
bedtime.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
So we did. And I felt SOOOOOOO much better, as did my poor kids ;) (who  <br/>
always seem to understand when Mama&#39;s a poophead and accept my apologies with  <br/>
grace and kindness). So later, instead of allowing myself to dwell in the house  <br/>
of crap I built, lol, I let myself feel good about making the change, about  <br/>
seeing what I did RIGHT, not what I did &quot;wrong.&quot; And THAT is what helps me know <br/>
 inside I&#39;m on the right path with them. <br/>
 <br/>
I am now reaffirmed in my desire to see hat I do, what we do right, and to  <br/>
stop focusing on all I feel I do that is wrong. It&#39;s bad for my heart of hearts <br/>
 anyway, and def. is for the kids too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-730374298">~~However, what I need to hear is suggestions on what I could be doing<br/>
better, not acceptance for what I did wrong.:) ~~<br/>
<br/>
Same here.<br/>
<br/>
I guess at this point, I KNOW everyone makes mistakes and having hung<br/>
out with so many unschooling families I realize we&#39;re all human!:)<br/>
<br/>
But what helps me the most is hearing about great ideas in rough<br/>
moments, gentle words when stressed or ways that people learned to<br/>
re-think situations and be creative!<br/>
<br/>
I know when I screw up too. I&#39;m at a point where I really don&#39;t need<br/>
to post a question to the list, because I&#39;m quite aware of how it<br/>
could have been handled better.<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple nights ago, Jalen was bouncing up the hallway unaware<br/>
that a kitten was right under his feet. I screamed &quot;JALEN&quot; at the top<br/>
of my lungs. Scared the crap out of him. I saw that foot heading for a<br/>
kitten and totally panicked.<br/>
<br/>
Poor guy was so sad that I had raised my voice. Even though I didn&#39;t<br/>
chastise him, the loud &quot;JALEN!&quot; was so unusual he got his feelings<br/>
hurt pretty badly. I felt like crap. It was panic, but I could have<br/>
handled it better.<br/>
<br/>
I got over there and hugged him long and hard and apologized for<br/>
scaring him. I explained that I was really scared that a kitten was<br/>
about to get stepped on, but I shouldn&#39;t have yelled like that. He&#39;s<br/>
really sensitive to any kind of loud voice. If you have an edge of<br/>
irritation in your voice he&#39;ll say &quot;don&#39;t yell at me&quot;. He&#39;s a great<br/>
barometer for me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo....I knew I could have handled it better. I knew exactly what<br/>
Kelly or Rue or Deb or Joyce or Meredith or Danielle would say (pretty<br/>
much...I hear their voices in my head now)HA!<br/>
<br/>
I also know that because it&#39;s unusual for him to hear that, it works<br/>
really well in emergencies. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey Karen,<br/>
<br/>
thanks for sharing your process through this kind of day. It was encouraging<br/>
to hear, as I was really overtired yeasterday arvo and did a bit of a temper<br/>
tantrum myself - ok, I WAS controlled, but kids can pick up the vibes.<br/>
You are so right, it&#39;s what we focus on - I can actually feel hurt that my<br/>
kids haven&#39;t listened to my requests and in this case, they were just having<br/>
a whole stack of fun and didn&#39;t MEAN to be quite that loud - they just got<br/>
carried away. They had a friend over and were making funny videos together<br/>
- I had asked them to keep it down because it was geting late and my hubby<br/>
had gone to bed). A humorous comment or a repeated reminder would have worked<br/>
fine - they are receptive kids. But I was asking them to be quiet, when my<br/>
son came to a bit in the movie where he had to make a loud noise - I think<br/>
they were being invaded by aliens, or something. I felt totally ignored and<br/>
walked out, slamming the door behind me. Yeah, I know....lol. I was thinking<br/>
about it after and realised that sometimes a sense of perspective is all<br/>
that&#39;s needed - so hard to find in the heat of the moment, but it&#39;s good<br/>
to have clarity on this kind of thing for next time.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034980350">I&#39;m thinking of the words to say I remember Ren&#39;s post about Jalen <br/>
and the couch. So I say in a non-threatening tone &quot;tell me what <br/>
happened here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Whoa - that is brilliant. That&#39;s it, the &#39;non-threatening tone&#39;. I often<br/>
find myself rushing over, all emotionally-charged. I love the way you handled<br/>
this, thanks for going into details. I have only really got to a place where<br/>
I can start to have the penny drop with each little detail of these sort<br/>
of scenarios, so this really helps me think my behaviour through. I have<br/>
a friend who adopts a neutral tone and it even calms ME down. She isn&#39;t a<br/>
pushover, but she is wise enough to know that she is the mediator or the<br/>
person with the postiion to help de-escalate things. I am learning SO much<br/>
from this approach. I am quite an exciteable personality, so I can be a bit<br/>
of a dummy with this kind of thing. After all, charging over with the old<br/>
&quot;What the @3*! is going on here&quot; is no help at all. I usually apologise for<br/>
jumping the gun and my kids are very forgiving, but I really want to get<br/>
some better techniques. This light bulb stuff for me, thanks!<br/>
