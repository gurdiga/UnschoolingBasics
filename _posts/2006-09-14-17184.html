<div id="ygrps-yiv-259833283">Hi, I just came across this idea of homeschooling/unschooling as I was<br/>
doing some research online to help me figure out what to do about my<br/>
3rd grader who just HATES School.  We just moved (but she hated school<br/>
before, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the move), the teacher seems great, so<br/>
does the school, and she has friends.  <br/>
She loves to play with her Leapfrog Explorer Globe, can find dozens of<br/>
countries in a flash on it, is working on states/capitals now---and<br/>
this is just in her free play time at home.  I think she might be the<br/>
sort of child who would thrive with unschooling, from the relatively<br/>
little I have read already.  <br/>
Any advice from those who started unschooling after a child was<br/>
already public schooled?  <br/>
 I have an older daughter who I would NOT keep at home, she has<br/>
multiple  developmental delays and is getting what SHE needs in<br/>
school.  Is is unfair to send one to school and unschool another?<br/>
Thanks! Joan<br/>
PS any ideas on convincing an unwilling spouse, as I imagine mine will<br/>
be if I go this route, he will say I&#39;m giving in to what my daughter<br/>
wants, to stay home.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Well, my DS was never in school BUT I was. You&#39;ll need to work on <br/>
getting the school mindset out, &quot;deschool&quot; as it&#39;s called. Even *with* <br/>
a child in school, you can change the way you look at and relate to <br/>
the school system.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Fair is making sure each child receives what s/he wants and needs. <br/>
Fair is not making everyone &#39;even&#39; as they do in school (you&#39;re going <br/>
too fast, so slow down...you&#39;re going too slow, so speed up...everyone <br/>
has to do the same things at the same time is NOT fair to most of <br/>
those involved).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why is doing what she wants a bad thing? If your DH wants ice cream <br/>
after dinner, would you be &#39;giving in&#39; to give him some? Why is it a <br/>
bad thing to give kids what they want and need but it&#39;s expected that <br/>
we&#39;ll give adults what they ask for without question most of the time?<br/>

<br/>
*************************<br/>
My oldest went through 2nd grade and then was brought home.  We eased our<br/>
way into unschooling, but still only did basic stuff (mostly math and *some*<br/>
vocabulary/grammar work) the first year.  After that we let go of curriculum<br/>
altogether.  Take a vacation and let go of all the schooly things.<br/>
<br/>
As for your other daughter, you will hear on this list and on other<br/>
unschooling forums that delays are calculated by a system that has no real<br/>
base.  A child who is unschooled will never be &quot;delayed.&quot;  There is nothing<br/>
to be delayed from.  You might also hear people say that whatever it is that<br/>
she *needs* from school can also be given to her at home (and more!)  Is it<br/>
fair to have one child in school and one not?  Sure, but only if the other<br/>
child *wants* to be in school.  If the other child is being sent and is<br/>
unhappy or jealous about the freedoms of the child at home I would say that<br/>
it isn&#39;t fair as you aren&#39;t really meeting the needs of everyone (and<br/>
emotional needs are as (if not more) important than educational needs.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083119632">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just started unschooling this year.  (actually just last week)  My <br/>
kids were in school through 3rd and 4th grades.  We finally pulled <br/>
them out after countless problems with public schools, and within <br/>
their school.  Now that we have been doing what is <br/>
called &quot;deschooling&quot;  my kids are enjoying learning again, about the <br/>
things they like.  Last week we tried experimenting on different <br/>
things that might take the tarnish off from pennies-(something my <br/>
son asked me if I knew how to do it/what would take it off).  We <br/>
brainstormed, and tried baking soda and water, peroxide, and even my <br/>
dad had told me he heard that coke will disolve a penny, so we tried <br/>
that too. None of that worked. I was talking to a friend of mine, <br/>
and she said taco sauce would do it.  So we tried soaking the penny <br/>
in taco sauce for like 15 minutes, and it worked.  All of this came <br/>
from my son, and his wanting to clean off the penny.  It was fun <br/>
brainstorming, and trying to figure out what worked.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know your situation with the public schools, but I can tell <br/>
you my kids were miserable.  They hated school, and didn&#39;t have fun <br/>
learning any more.  Some other things happened, which was the straw <br/>
that broke the camels back, so we pulled them out.  Now they have so <br/>
much more freedoms, and they are getting excited about learning-<br/>
about the things they are interested in- not what is forced on them <br/>
in the public school system.  Sorry if this sounds like I am soured <br/>
on public schools, we have been through alot in the past 4 and 5 <br/>
years.  I don&#39;t think schools promote exciting things to learn <br/>
about, and force the kids to learn about what they feel is <br/>
necessary.  I remember not liking school, and doing only what I had <br/>
to do, to graduate and get out. I think it&#39;s important for me and my <br/>
husband to grow along with the kids, and learn together.  I think, <br/>
even in the short times we&#39;ve been unschooling, I&#39;ve seen definate <br/>
changes, and luckily my hubby is with me every step of the way.  In <br/>
fact when we first started researching homeschooling, neither one of <br/>
us was sure about it, but now I wouldn&#39;t want it any other way.  I <br/>
hope this helps some--sorry I&#39;m so long winded.  I&#39;m sure I will <br/>
stumble, but there is always a way to get back up and try again.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and the best advice I can give is to just enjoy, and live <br/>
life, and have fun.  Kids don&#39;t stay young for very long.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603177688">Hm, is it unschooling to do as if you don&#39;t know the answer and do  <br/>
all kinds of experiments just to have your children go through the  <br/>
experience? I don&#39;t mean to say something bad about what you wrote!  <br/>
I&#39;m new to this and would like to hear the opinions of the people who  <br/>
are experienced. I mean, it would have been easier to look it up on  <br/>
google. Trying all kinds of things as to make it like more &quot;learning&quot;  <br/>
seems to me like you&#39;re trying to .. I dunno! I mean... maybe your  <br/>
children didn&#39;t know they could find out in an easier way and if they  <br/>
ever find out that it could have been an easy look up think, why did  <br/>
we have to do all this (even if it was &quot;fun&quot;... you  know what I  <br/>
mean?). Of course, doing it the way you did it also sounds  <br/>
unschooling to me.<br/>

I too, am new to this.  This whole experiment thing<br/>
happened because my son came to me.  I never thought<br/>
about looking it up on the computer, we just wanted to<br/>
brainstorm, and see what we thought would clean the<br/>
penny.  My son loves to do this kind of stuff, so who<br/>
am I to tell him to look it up on the computer.  I<br/>
think he feels he learns more from trying, than<br/>
looking it up on the computer.  Seeing the effects of<br/>
what we tried is more fun than reading about them.  I<br/>
welcome any and all ideas from anyone.  I am new to<br/>
unschooling, but had fun with my kids trying to clean<br/>
the penny.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; son asked me if I knew how to do it/what would<br/>
&gt; take it off). We<br/>
&gt; &gt; brainstormed, and tried baking soda and water,<br/>
&gt; peroxide, and even my<br/>
&gt; &gt; dad had told me he heard that coke will disolve a<br/>
&gt; penny, so we tried<br/>
&gt; &gt; that too. None of that worked. I was talking to a<br/>
&gt; friend of mine,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and she said taco sauce would do it. So we tried<br/>
&gt; soaking the penny<br/>
&gt; &gt; in taco sauce for like 15 minutes, and it worked.<br/>
&gt; All of this came<br/>
&gt; &gt; from my son, and his wanting to clean off the<br/>
&gt; penny. It was fun<br/>
&gt; &gt; brainstorming, and trying to figure out what<br/>
&gt; worked.<br/>

That&#39;s the beauty of unschooling. One family will go straight to google while another will play around with their own experimentation. Some will do both. Some neither, they&#39;ll use a book or caqll grandpa. It all counts. It&#39;s all learning.<br/>

&gt; seems to me like you&#39;re trying to .. I dunno! I mean... maybe your  <br/>
&gt; children didn&#39;t know they could find out in an easier way and if they  <br/>
&gt; ever find out that it could have been an easy look up think, why did  <br/>
&gt; we have to do all this (even if it was &quot;fun&quot;... you  know what I  <br/>

&gt; unschooling to me.<br/>
