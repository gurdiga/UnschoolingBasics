<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399983941">Hello All, I beg your pardon for this slightly off topic request;  I am looking for a new <br/>
physician and dentist in the Boston and/or greater Boston area.  The further on our <br/>
unschooling journey we get, the less I feel able to deal with docs and dentists from <br/>
mainstream medical community.  Does anyone have any recommendations for heath care <br/>
practitioners -- alternative, gentle, relationship oriented practitioners with wisdom and deep <br/>
knowledge about all aspects of well-being and medicine?  Thank you,<br/>
<br/>

Where in Boston are you?I have a doctor that I adore who sees lots of  <br/>
unschoolers. He&#39;s a homeopath as well as MD, and very cool. His name is Leonard  <br/>
Horowitz, and he is in Danvers. Depending where you are it could be a trek, but  <br/>
maybe worth it for a good doctor.<br/>
