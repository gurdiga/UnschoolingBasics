What  if I did that? Or Dh? What if I got up tomorrow and decided to<br/>
do just what  I wanted? No breakfast today kids,no clean clothes<br/>
either. I&#39;m going to  enjoy myself,not do anything useful<br/>
whatsoever.Everbody fend for yourself  now.BTW, Dh lost his job<br/>
because he&#39;s just doing what is fun now, and we no  longer have a<br/>
house or car,or  electricity&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
This may have already been said, if so just delete.  I am in the  middle of <br/>
reading responses.  But there is a middle ground.  I know  several moms who do <br/>
not enjoy cooking big meals.  But still love their  children and their <br/>
children are fed, not starving.  Since one  mom&#39;s son was little he has been cooking <br/>
his own eggs, and enjoys it.   I make a double batch of bagels every week and <br/>
stick them in the fridge so that  in the mornings there is something already <br/>
done, either they or I can pop them  in the toaster.  I do not like cooking <br/>
first thing in the morning.  We  have cereal around that they like so they can <br/>
get it for themselves.  To  tell you the truth really we graze, eat small stuff <br/>
all day.  We never eat  together as in a &quot;meal&quot; because we are never hungry <br/>
together.  So we have  lots of snack type foods in the fridge where the boys can <br/>
get at them.   They know how to prepare their favorites like mac and cheese, <br/>
or make a  sandwich.  etc.  So just because you do not get up and cook <br/>
breakfast  does not mean that the kids will not have breakfast.  And if you do not  <br/>
enjoy cooking breakfast I would encourage you to all brainstorm and figure out <br/>
a  way to make it work.  It can be done.  <br/>
 <br/>
I enjoy myself every day, and I think that is plenty useful.  But if  there <br/>
are things you are doing that you do not enjoy I personally would not be  doing <br/>
them.  I would brain storm to see that things happen though.   Like laundry, <br/>
you can do a chore exchange with a friend.  She brings her  kids over and she <br/>
does your laundry and you make a supper type meal for her to  take home and <br/>
pop in the oven at her house.  Etc.  Have to think  outside the box.  <br/>
 <br/>
If Jackson, he&#39;s my dh, did not enjoy his job we would brainstorm about  that <br/>
too.  I know people who have made that change in life as well.  I  know one <br/>
dad who did not want to work, he wanted them to all be together as a  family <br/>
all the time.  He didn&#39;t want to miss out on the unschooling, the  house, the <br/>
family at all.  So they saved up money for a year, sold  everything they had, <br/>
bought a piece of land in BC, Canada, and are homesteading  right now.  They are <br/>
building their own house, well right now they are on  hold for the winter, <br/>
just keeping warm.  But they are doing it, they made  the leap.  They still have <br/>
a car, no electricity except a small generator  they use when they want to <br/>
make a phone call (longer story...LOL).   Eventually they will have a wind <br/>
generator and electricity.   They are  loving it.  And no one is working outside <br/>
the home for money.<br/>
 <br/>
I am not saying that you have to do that.  LOL.  I am just saying  to <br/>
consider everyone&#39;s wants and needs, your&#39;s as well, and brainstorm about  these <br/>
things.  Don&#39;t just assume that it can&#39;t be done.  Don&#39;t assume  that if you <br/>
didn&#39;t cook breakfast the kids would go hungry.  <br/>
 <br/>
OK I am rambling now, but anyway, it can work.  <br/>

My sister&#39;s husband felt that way a couple years ago. He was working<br/>
at a soul-sucking job that paid really well but left him little time<br/>
for his family or himself. They planned out their &quot;escape&quot; and<br/>
eventually he quit (had to sell his shares even, as he was a part<br/>

the U.S. and eventually went back to Alaska where he now works as a<br/>
realtor, setting his own hours and spending a lot of time with his family.<br/>

Our lifestyle and income making is a choice.  It might take a lot of<br/>
planning and work to change that but if a person doesn&#39;t like some<br/>
aspect of their lives, they really should change it! That simple.<br/>

This is true. I am in the planning stages right now. I can&#39;t just quit without some serious consequences, but I am hoping to have things sorted out early next year. And then I will quit. I can&#39;t wait. <br/>
