<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887558565">I thought the following was an interesting blog - it suggests that<br/>
entertainment (no matter what form of entertainment - even violent<br/>
types) is useful for children to learn more about themselves and the<br/>
world.<br/>

quote:<br/>
<br/>
I am on Chapter 3 of &quot;Killing Monsters: Why children need fantasy,<br/>
super heroes, and make-believe violence&quot; by Gerard Jones. It&#39;s very<br/>
well written and makes a lot of sense to me. Here&#39;s a paragraph on<br/>
page 18 that gives the gist of the thesis:<br/>
<br/>
    When we consider children in relation to mass media and pop<br/>
culture, we tend to define them as consumers, watchers, recipients,<br/>
victims. But they are also users of that media and culture: they are<br/>
choosers, interpreters, shapers, fellow players, participants, and<br/>
storytellers. Viewing children as passive recipients of the media&#39;s<br/>
power puts us at odds with the fantasies they&#39;ve chosen, and thus with<br/>
the children themselves. Viewing them as active users enables us to<br/>
work with their entertainment - any entertainment - to help them grow.<br/>
Shooter games, gangsta rap, Pokemon all become tools for parents and<br/>
teachers to help young people feel stronger, calm their fears, and<br/>
learn more about themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The book is very thought-provoking and jibes with everything we have<br/>
noticed about our kids. Manisha remembers the incident when Supriya<br/>
used the milk-bottle of her doll as a gun. That was when the only gun<br/>
Supriya knew about was a squirt-gun. So she&#39;d point it at Manisha,<br/>
make a shooting motion and ask her, &quot;Did you get wet?&quot; Supriya has<br/>
recently been fascinated by Pokemon, but we have not seen much violent<br/>
fantasy-play from either of the kids.<br/>
