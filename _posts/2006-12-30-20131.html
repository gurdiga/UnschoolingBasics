<br/>
Intro&#39;s are nice but their not necessary. : )<br/>
Yahoo says this list has 1329 members now.  That&#39;s a lot of people but only <br/>
a small percentage of people post regularly.   Maybe most people have a <br/>
better brain than I do but I don&#39;t remember people by their introductions. <br/>
I remember after they&#39;ve posted a few times and I&#39;ve seen their names and <br/>
gotten a feel for their writing style.<br/>
<br/>
So, for any newbies (and there seems to be a lot of new folks) don&#39;t sweat <br/>
over intro&#39;s if they&#39;re not your thing.  Join in and we&#39;ll get to know you <br/>
by your contributions.  (or lurk, that&#39;s ok too.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, thanks.  I was just befuddled over whether anyone had seen any of my<br/>
contributions to the list, and had wanted to erm, nicely, say it without<br/>
projecting the appearance of a whiner ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for the welcome :-)</div>
