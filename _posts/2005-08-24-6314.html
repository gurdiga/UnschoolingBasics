<div id="ygrps-yiv-83434507">I got a flyer about a workshop coming up here in SC called &quot;Stree Free <br/>
Homeschooling,&quot; and I couldn&#39;t help but think about our unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine being stressed while unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think the only thing that would be stressful is actually &quot;getting it&quot; <br/>
and replying to grandparents or neighbors---but I&#39;m waaaay past that as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I get overwhelmed by too much on my plate, but usually I&#39;m <br/>
having too much fun to drop something. I just need to stop and focus <br/>
and regroup a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of burn-out from unschooling. Anyone else?<br/>
<br/>
To me, this is the most stress-free way to live ever!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The only one I know who burned out on *unschooling* and sent her kids off to<br/>
school, was a person, who I felt, really didn&#39;t GET unschooling.  She<br/>
thought she got it but she never really trusted.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is stress-free for us.  But try telling other people that.  This<br/>
is the time of year when everyone keeps asking the kids what grade they are<br/>
going into and because they can never remember what grade they would be in<br/>
age-wise, we end up getting into a discussion about homeschooling.  &quot;Oh, so<br/>
who is your teacher, your mom or dad?&quot;  I tried telling someone yesterday<br/>
that we all learn from each other, but they just didn&#39;t get it.   <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my point was, that when people hear that you homeschool, they get<br/>
this image in their head of some wonder-mom who just does it all.  I do do a<br/>
lot for my kids but it all revolves around horses at this point.  It&#39;s a<br/>
pleasure for me to help them with their horses and not stressful or a chore<br/>
to me at all.  Everyone seems to think it would be so hard to be a<br/>
homeschool mom when the truth is so far from that.  It&#39;s much easier to  be<br/>
a homeschool mom, living a stress-free unschooling life, then it ever would<br/>
be to try to live on the school schedule and enforce homework, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I just love my life!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157680071">Hi Angela<br/>
<br/>
I understand about the grade thing. The kids here go back to school in a couple of weeks, everyone is running round buying kit, stationery and bags e.t.c  and people keep saying &quot;Oh the holidays are nearly over.&quot;   Not for us they aren&#39;t.  Life seems one long,  brilliant, exciting, fun filled holiday.<br/>

<br/>
But I have to say, I did get some notebooks while they were on sale.  (dh<br/>
went, actually)  6 notebooks for only a little over a dollar at Staples.  We<br/>
bought 4 packages of 6.  the kids can write stories to their hearts content<br/>
all year and I only spent about .20 cents per notebook.  :)  Gotta love<br/>
those back to school sales.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201092755">Hi Angela<br/>
<br/>
I get my boys a bulk paper order cos the just love to draw. They go through tons of paper every year and lots of pens. They have a little set of drawers they call their tower and put it all in. My girls love little diaries to write all their stuff in.<br/>
<br/>
The notebooks sound a bargain.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I will admit that i sometimes get what i call mommy burnout - i don&#39;t <br/>
think it&#39;s about unschooling but more about my own inabilities to carve <br/>
space for myself or to accept the chaotic messes in my home without <br/>
becoming resentful when i feel like all i ever get to is cooking or <br/>
cleaning up.  Taking care of my own needs while being available to my <br/>
kids and partner without feeling guilty or resentful is something i <br/>
find i have to relearn over and over again.<br/>
<br/>
This summer both my girls attended a day camp for five days at the same <br/>
time and i so thouroughly enjoyed the peaceful quiet 5 hours a day i <br/>
had for an entire week...i could actually finish something i started <br/>
without being interrupted.  i could actually finish a thought in my <br/>
head.  <br/>
