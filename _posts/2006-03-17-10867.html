<div id="ygrps-yiv-699073879">Before I go crazy! It&#39;s spring break here, and as usual we are the  <br/>
boarding house for all the kids who&#39;s parents work. I honestly don&#39;t  <br/>
mind, I LIKE having more kids here, it&#39;s fun and gives everyone just  <br/>
something different to do. And usually the kids are great too, they  <br/>
don&#39;t go crazy on the food or videogames or anything.<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that, a little while back I could here Rachel sobbing  <br/>
and screaming don&#39;t touch that, it&#39;s MINE. So I run down stairs to  <br/>
the basement to see what&#39;s going on. She&#39;s on her bed, tears running  <br/>
down her face with her little friend next to her. When questioned,  <br/>
Rachel manages to tell me (between sobs) that her Tiger (big four  <br/>
foot stuffed animal) is special to her today and she doesn&#39;t want  <br/>
anyone touching it. At that point I can see Elizabeth with her hand  <br/>
on the tiger, very solemn look on her face. Rachel is talking, and  <br/>
suddenly Elizabeth tells me very seriously that when people come over  <br/>
to your house, you just have to learn how to share. Both said a few  <br/>
more things, but honestly I couldn&#39;t remember them to save my life. I  <br/>
could tell this wasn&#39;t about the tiger really, and she wasn&#39;t just  <br/>
wanting to be mean, she honestly thinks she was doing Rachel a favor.  <br/>
She actually said, &quot;Rachel, at some time in your life you just HAVE  <br/>
to learn that you can&#39;t keep everyone from your stuff&quot;. I was  <br/>
sickened, because I could just imagine her parents saying that to  <br/>
her. They are some of my best friends, but please, what a crock. I  <br/>
managed to keep calm and patient, and explained in our house we don&#39;t  <br/>
have that rule, that if someone is feeling that something is special  <br/>
we try to respect that. Usually they wind up sharing because they  <br/>
want to.  She seemed to understand that, and I asked her to leave so  <br/>
i could spend some special time with Rachel. I sat there with her on  <br/>
my lap, and just rocked her back and forth. She truly did not  <br/>
understand why anyone would be forced to share something. And what  <br/>
really pisses me off more than anything (sorry for the language, but  <br/>
honestly the emotion is so intense i cannot think of another word for  <br/>
it) is I KNOW that her parents have stuff that their kids aren&#39;t  <br/>
allowed to touch. What a double standard, &#39;you have to share all your  <br/>
special things, but don&#39;t think about touching MINE because I&#39;m a  <br/>
grownup&#39; blech blech blech.<br/>
<br/>
God, I feel so sick. Poor Rachel was having such a great day, they  <br/>
started a new club (the shamrock club, of course), and Josh and Emily  <br/>
were running around tallying how many people wanted to be members,  <br/>
polling what kind of snacks we should have. And its just kind of put  <br/>
Rachel in a fragile place emotionally. She&#39;s having a good time now  <br/>
watching the big kids play marioparty, but I can just sense that it  <br/>
could break her if one little thing goes wrong. :-(<br/>
<br/>
Sigh. Thanks for listening. i just had to share with someone who  <br/>
would understand. My dh would listen, nod his head, but I know he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t get it. he&#39;s a big &quot;Don&#39;t touch my stuff&quot; person too, but  <br/>
still thinks that kids should have different rules. We have a huge  <br/>
family, and while most of the toys voluntarily go into public bins, I  <br/>
really think the kids deserve to have some stuff of their own. Duh.  <br/>
It&#39;s a basic right. Someone on another group just a few days ago was  <br/>
saying that she was tossing all of her son&#39;s stuff that wouldn&#39;t fit  <br/>
into a bin, it&#39;s just &#39;junk&#39; and besides, it&#39;s not &quot;christian&quot; to  <br/>
hold physical things dear to your heart. HELLO!? I&#39;m a Christian, and  <br/>
I hold my things dear, and so do my kids. Why don&#39;t you take another  <br/>
verse and twist it to your own purpose.<br/>
Sigh. My box is getting slippery, I&#39;d better climb down before I  <br/>
break my neck. Thanks again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783530531">You go girl !! I have been up against the same thing most of the time because of our neighbors and I am always the nice one and all the kids are always welcome at my house. Really all I am is there unpaid babysitter when they are in the house watching TV or what ever they are doing that they don&#39;t want there kids to see!! When my kids want to play or something no one else can! How weird is that?? I know what you are talking about and you do have to vent because if you don&#39;t it will nawwwwww at your insides till your sick! Believe me I know. My husband sais I am to nice and I will never say anything to them. You know he is right.<br/>

whole &quot;forced sharing&quot; thing.  Why do we have to learn to share?  When <br/>

***************************************************************************<br/>
LOL, Never heard of a slippery soap box!<br/>
 <br/>
I agree with your post.<br/>
I have a few things that are dear to me. I would be crushed if  something <br/>
happened to them. I&#39;ve lost much over the years from leaving it for  others to <br/>
view (touch and break). For instance I have a box of photo&#39;s from my  childhood. <br/>
It&#39;s important to me that they stay and keep over the  years. <br/>
My daughter has items that she places in her top drawer if she wants them  <br/>
safe. The two little guys don&#39;t always understand so we help Cass keep  them <br/>
safe. One item in her drawer is a lil flower person she made at the 04  <br/>
convention. She treasures it so I always make sure I place her items  on top of it to <br/>
keep it hidden.<br/>
 <br/>
I used to have a friend who would hand her children&#39;s toys to my kids and  <br/>
say &quot;Oh they don&#39;t want(or need)  it any longer&quot; I felt so sad bc I  could see <br/>
it in their eyes but they were afraid to say so...<br/>
 <br/>
My Dh doesn&#39;t get some things either. He listens but....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062151023">******Really all I am is there unpaid babysitter  *******<br/>
 <br/>
I need my own vent here!  My friends trade off babysitting  constantly.  My <br/>
kids are the oldest, but of course being the oldest are  also the easiest.  <br/>
None of my friends are homeschoolers.<br/>
 <br/>
I have needed my friends&#39; help with babysitting.  My husband is  military and <br/>
gone for long periods of time.  I have tried to only ask when  I really <br/>
needed help.  Maybe two or three times a month and usually one  child at a time.<br/>
 <br/>
The other day, I asked for help and I was told that she would be glad to  <br/>
watch my kids, but she was going to charge me $8 an hour.  I am hurt.   I don&#39;t <br/>
mind paying, but I feel like it is because if my kids were in school I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t need the help.<br/>
 <br/>
Grrrrr.<br/>
