<div id="ygrps-yiv-188497683">Some of you may know that our family is a combination of different <br/>
educational and living styles.  Adrian and I are the only &quot;real&quot; <br/>
unschoolers in our family.  I&#39;m the appointed chore police officer, <br/>
and I hate it!  Pat works away from home 10 hours a day plus he does <br/>
side jobs some nights.  He&#39;s a transmission mechanic, and a very good <br/>
one, so he&#39;s always got work.  I stay home and care for and <br/>
educate/facilitate learning for the kids, depending on which child <br/>
and what time of year your talking about.  <br/>
<br/>
We have grown to have two VERY different ideas of parenting.  He is <br/>
very much the authoritive parent.  I&#39;ve tried talking to him and <br/>
expressing concern and offering alternatives to the way he handles <br/>
things to no avail. Five of the kids are his, and two are mine, so <br/>
we&#39;re a little out numbered.  Since becoming a &quot;real&quot; unschooler and <br/>
implementing the way of life into more than just my days with Adrian <br/>
things have improved.  That is, MY relationship with the kids, not <br/>
his, as he does not even have a clue.  He spends A LOT of time being <br/>
angry about this or that.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes down to it, I&#39;ve always been an unschooler in many <br/>
aspects of my life and philosophies.  I just didn&#39;t know it had a <br/>
word.  The thing of it is that I have to operate around certain <br/>
parameters.  Those being kids in public school and a &quot;partner&quot; that <br/>
has no clue about how to have a real relationship with his children <br/>
and how to live in a fun and relaxed manner with them.<br/>
<br/>
What my current dilemma is and what I&#39;d like to figure out is our <br/>
household chore schedule.  How have any of you made the transition <br/>
from having assigned chores to not having any?  We actually have a <br/>
system that works rather well for us, but it&#39;s no longer working for <br/>
me.  (The kids each have a room for a week then they switch.  That <br/>
way no one has to do something they don&#39;t like for very long and very <br/>
often.  That means that if you just had bathroom you won&#39;t have it <br/>
again for over a month.)  See, when a certain few of our kids that <br/>
don&#39;t ever want to help out at all or even pick up after themselves <br/>
don&#39;t do their part, then I get the blame for it, and it&#39;s a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reaching a point that it&#39;s not worth the battle.  I&#39;m already <br/>
pooped.  I&#39;d love to not have to follow said chid/ren around to make <br/>
sure they did what they were supposed to do so that dad doesn&#39;t blow <br/>
his top.  It&#39;s ridiculous!  I&#39;m worried that if I just say, &quot;No one <br/>
has chores anymore!&quot; our house would fall apart.  I will be the one <br/>
responsible for EVERYTHING.  There are NINE of us.  One child in <br/>
particular, 16 yrs, is terrible about taking care of her stuff and <br/>
the house.  It effects our whole household.  I&#39;m all for them being <br/>
able to be slobs as long as it isn&#39;t ruining someone elses day, ie if <br/>
their bedrooms are trashed, but he won&#39;t even let that go.  How do <br/>
you achieve that?  How do you have order when no one is expected to <br/>
do anything?  Is it possible to transition from the one extreme to <br/>
the other when life has been that way for so long?  I know it would <br/>
be no biggie if it were just me and my two.  We can live together <br/>
like that easily, but we get it.  How do you do it with so many that <br/>
don&#39;t?  Is it possible?<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that have been there, done that, what have you done <br/>
that worked and didn&#39;t work in your family, and why?<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that are just life experts from education, reading, <br/>
what have you, what is your opinion, and why?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear from all of you on this.  Shine some light for me.  <br/>
My sanity is on the line...<br/>

<br/>
My thought is that this is a bigger problem since it is part of the<br/>
foundation of your family life, while &quot;chores or not&quot; is a symptom. My<br/>
suggestion is gradual change rather than a sweeping (no pun intended)<br/>
disruption of every routine you have. I don&#39;t know how people manage in this<br/>
kind of situation where there is a truly fundamental disagreement between<br/>
the parents. Even the idea of still thinking of the family in these divided<br/>
terms must make it harder for you all.<br/>
<br/>
There is a message board for Dads at www.unschooling.com  and there is a<br/>
workshop for Dads at the Live and Learn Conference. My dh really enjoyed<br/>
that experience. There were some reluctant spouses there, but since the men<br/>
agreed to keep the content of the meeting confidential that is the extent of<br/>
my knowledge about the event.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a message board about dealing with reluctant relatives there<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
My dh is not reluctant by any means, and &quot;gets it&quot; totally. However he<br/>
sometimes is complacent, whereas I am always seeking to become more deeply<br/>
immersed in Unschooling and increase my awareness and mindfulness.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to give my dh articles, but I found out that he was<br/>
interpreting my giving him the suggestion to read stuff as a criticism of<br/>
himself. So it was making him sad, grumpy and defensive instead of open to<br/>
the ideas in the article or book. Now if I find something I think he would<br/>
appreciate, I talk to him about it first. I found he would not read a whole<br/>
book, but sometimes will look at highlighted passages. Sometimes I just read<br/>
bits out loud to him, after asking if he wants to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
<br/>

****************************<br/>

<br/>
Tina,<br/>
<br/>
No expert here, but have you read the &quot;reluctance folder&quot; at the <br/>
www.unschooling.com message boards?  There&#39;s lots of helpful ideas all over the place, but <br/>
that might be a place to begin.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like what you are experiencing crosses the borders of unschooling <br/>
though, too.  You&#39;ve got  the &quot;step&quot; issue and you&#39;ve got a spouse that may <br/>
feel he has more control in the relationship because of the &quot;income&quot; issue.<br/>
<br/>
I have been in both places, although my dh did not bring children to our <br/>
marriage 15 years ago,  I had 2.  It was &quot;touch and go&quot; a lot of the time - you <br/>
don&#39;t have an easy road ahead of you.<br/>
<br/>
I did 2 things - I continually told him &quot;I&#39;ll take care of it&quot; - as in, <br/>
&quot;don&#39;t get all worked up, I&#39;ve got it covered, even if it doesn&#39;t look like it on <br/>
the surface.&quot;  I also got a job.  Talk about your major shifts!  Yikes!  I <br/>
never realized how much value he placed on income contribution.  It landed us in <br/>
marriage counseling for almost a year, when I started making more $$ than he <br/>
did.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, dh has some &quot;anger management issues&quot; and the older I get, the calmer <br/>
and more patient I get.  We talk ..... I let him know how it makes the kids and <br/>
I feel when he gets all wound up.  Sometimes I just give him &quot;the look&quot;.  It <br/>
is painfully slow progress, but I do feel we are taking teeny tiny baby steps <br/>
in the right direction.  He is aware of our differences and does try to <br/>
approach life differently.  He really does try.  I can see it.  He certainly has <br/>
things more under control than when we married.  But sometimes he slips but he&#39;s <br/>
so much more aware now.<br/>
<br/>
He was raised in blue collar Detroit, in a macho man neighborhood and home.  <br/>
I&#39;m sure there was a lot of damage done.  I also try to remember that.  The <br/>
same techniques I keep in use in gentle parenting, I try to swing over to <br/>
&quot;gentle spousing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in a nutshell, what I guess I&#39;m trying to say is BTDT and with <br/>
patience, modeling and communication, there may be some hope.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you all the best - hang in there, you&#39;ll make it!<br/>

Tracy,  yep - he was raised in the 1950&#39;s and 60&#39;s there.  The stories are <br/>
mind boggling to me (a non-Detroiter).  He had relatives who hit their wives!!!! <br/>
 And although he expresses disdain - no one did anything about it.  They just <br/>
&quot;sucked it up&quot;!<br/>

Thanks for pointing this out, guys!  It&#39;s something I never thought <br/>
of, but it makes a lot of sense.  He grew up with the exact same type <br/>
of up bringing.  I grew up further north, Port Huron, but it&#39;s a <br/>
world of difference.  I find that our ages, family life and now where <br/>
we were raised play a lot in our individual personalities, beliefs <br/>
and parenting styles.  I would have never hit on this without your <br/>
insight.<br/>

<br/>
You are very right about this, and I knew it before you said it.  I <br/>
have given a lot of thought to what&#39;s going on here.  I guess I&#39;m <br/>
just looking for a way to be a little more happy and a lot less <br/>
stressed.  I want to be the best I can be and enable those around me, <br/>
my children, to be the best they can be.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would be good for me to just keep up with the chore schedule <br/>
and pick up the slackwhen they don&#39;t do what they&#39;re supposed to, <br/>
like he seems to think I should.  That would end the fighting, and I <br/>
would be doing less than if I just took it all over myself.  Maybe <br/>
that would be a little closer to the unschooling philosophy for <br/>
everyone in our home.  Maybe they would notice and take note, and <br/>
maybe not, and that&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a ton - Tina</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440968193">Oh Tina, with all those kids I just have to say your dh has no buisness  <br/>
blaming you for anything as far as the tidiness of the house!  You&#39;ve  really got <br/>
your hands full.  I have two boys, and one husband that just as  well be one <br/>
of my kids, and i&#39;m worn out with just them.  Maybe your dh  could spend a week <br/>
in your shoes and he would understand alittle better what you  are going <br/>
thru?! <br/>
syndi<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97934444">I just wanted to share what happened here yesterday.  I had wanted to take<br/>
the kids to the library but they were closed because of the holiday so we<br/>
started talking about what else we might do.  Mondays I usually do some<br/>
cleaning up because our band comes over to practice in the evening.  Dc love<br/>
band night because it fills the house with fun interesting people.  I<br/>
mentioned also how the dog was recovering from an allergic reaction to fleas<br/>
and how I wanted to shampoo the carpets to get rid of any lurking there.  We<br/>
all decided it would make sense to call an all out work day ( with a trip to<br/>
the mall thrown in for a video game trade).<br/>
<br/>
Just then two little friends of ours called to see if they could come over.<br/>
Well, yes, they may but we&#39;re  just cleaning the house today.  They said<br/>
fine, we&#39;ll help.  Our friends are 10 and 11 and are always wanting to come<br/>
with us whatever we&#39;re up to.<br/>
<br/>
So all 5 kids (my three and 2 guests) spent 3 hours doing chores.  DD made a<br/>
game out of it:  Draw a chore out of a jar - Run and do as much as possible<br/>
for 15 minutes - Come back and switch if you want.  In the the end the<br/>
carpets didn&#39;t get shampooed but lots of things got done I hadn&#39;t even<br/>
suggested.  DD&#39;s friend organized her desk and decorated her room with her<br/>
dolls.  DS&#39;s friend changed my sheets and made the bed.  Between them all we<br/>
got the bathrooms cleaned and the back yard free of dog-doo. And even a bag<br/>
of trash removed from my van.  We stopped every now and then to eat<br/>
something or to play the new video game but for the most part everyone just<br/>
worked.<br/>
<br/>
When I took them home I thanked J and K for their help and laughed that they<br/>
should come over more often.  They replied that they&#39;d rather be at my house<br/>
cleaning than spend the day at their boring house.  Go figure.<br/>
