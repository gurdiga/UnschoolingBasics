<div id="ygrps-yiv-240861240">&quot;This is amazing!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes and no.<br/>
<br/>
I am still likely to say &quot;WOW&quot; internally sometimes...because natural <br/>
learning is something I did not get to understand and observe until <br/>
*I* fully let go. But if you think about it, it isn&#39;t amazing in an <br/>
unusual way....it&#39;s just how humans learn. We&#39;re so schooled that it <br/>
will probably amaze us for the rest of our lives though.:)<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, humans ARE amazing, interesting creatures...so <br/>
maybe how they learn is just amazing regardless of whether you were <br/>
schooled or not.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, when I point out some learning moment that was really <br/>
cool, Trevor (15) just looks at me and says &quot;well yeah Mom&quot;, as if it <br/>
wasn&#39;t amazing at all. Their world is so very different from our own. <br/>
Isn&#39;t it cool!?<br/>
