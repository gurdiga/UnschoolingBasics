<div id="ygrps-yiv-124762403">How did you make the transition?<br/>
<br/>
Hi, my name is Tracey and I am a homeschooling mom of five - ages 13, 10, 6, 4, and 20 months.  I&#39;ve considered unschooling a few times, but always chickened out.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re using My Father&#39;s World curriculum right now, and although we do enjoy it, unschooling&#39;s freedom and how you let your children explore their interests more still attracts me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-588483079">We&#39;re in the process of doing it right now.  My kids are 12 (almost 13), 11<br/>
and 5.  It is very scary for me still and I tell myself that if I need to<br/>
(for me) I can always go back to curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
We just quit altogether.  I let the kids decide what they want to do.  My<br/>
oldest is very curious about science and is really pursuing that.  My<br/>
youngest is really pushing to learn to read.  But, my middle seemingly is<br/>
only interested in Legos.  It must be what he needs to be learning about<br/>
right now!<br/>
<br/>
It is a very scary step, but since we&#39;ve been unschooling (about 2 months)<br/>
my oldest has learned SO much and my middle son has actually started to show<br/>
an interest in books...that is HUGE!<br/>

Well, Tracey, I never had a pre-packaged curric but I did spend many, many days going through our state&#39;s standards, printing them out, reading each one to see which bit of nonsense applied to my son, which he had already done and hadn&#39;t done, highlighting and cutting and pasting until I had a lovely notebook full of a year&#39;s worth of stuff. Compiled from 3-4 grade levels.<br/>
Then there was hsing with my actual son. Darned if he didn&#39;t deviate from the plan! :) <br/>
The notebook was quickly shelved and never used again. <br/>
But I did go through a year where we had a traditional annual evaluation and I dutifully logged activities and collected papers and odds and ends. <br/>
We switched to another option in our state that fits us better and doesn&#39;t make me think of our days in terms of being split up into subjects but for a while we were close enough to a standard curric to know it didn&#39;t work for us. And it took a while to let go of a lot of that thinking -- all together, a year or two.<br/>
Short answer: Yes. :)<br/>
Give yourselves lots of time to transition and enjoy! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068424572">My stepson, Ray, came to us at 13 from school and living at his bio mom&#39;s house, but before then he lived with us and homeschooled. Since he&#39;d had so many years of &quot;you have to do this bc its how you will learn&quot; I found it important to talk with him a bit about unschooling and deschooling so he didn&#39;t feel like we were just abandoning him, educationally speaking. Something else I did was to appologise to him for my previous parenting - that was something that came up wrt our younger child, since she &quot;gets&quot; to do a lot of things he wouldn&#39;t have been allowed to do at the same age. <br/>
