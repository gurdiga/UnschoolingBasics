More than likely, I&#39;d keep it in savings until I knew what kinds of things my kids wanted to do, would like to buy, etc. There&#39;s no need to go out and immediately spend it, is there? It would be money put aside for just my kids, and as things came up, it would feel good knowing the money was available for what they wanted, or what would enhance their unschooling lives and support their loves and interests.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591823558">It totally depends on your kids - Caren&#39;s suggestiong that you put it toward riding lessons is right on the mark! Some things I&#39;ve bought with annual tax money (or plan to buy this year):<br/>
<br/>
building toys (get big lots on ebay)<br/>
art supplies<br/>
save for travel<br/>
video games and game equipment<br/>
board games <br/>
movies<br/>
upgrade computer<br/>
trampoline<br/>
swingset<br/>
slide<br/>
bikes<br/>
microscope<br/>
books<br/>
sewing machine<br/>
assorted blacksmithing and woodworking tools<br/>
magazine subscriptions<br/>
membership to local &quot;childrens museum&quot;<br/>
club dues or fees<br/>
seasonal toys <br/>
musical instruments<br/>
new clothes<br/>
<br/>
Its good to have a &quot;wish list&quot; on paper or in your head so you have a sense of what the big-money needs are ahead of time. I can get books and games inexpensively online, for instance, all through the year, so that&#39;s a lower priority for the tax money than upgrading electronics or other tools or socking some money away for fall travels. <br/>
<br/>
For little kids its good to stock up on the sorts of supplies that are cheaper in bulk - for instance, buying gallons of paint, or tempera mixes saves money in the longer term, so its worth stocking up (and those no-spill cups, too... gosh I need more of those). Getting big lots of legos is a good buy, too, so its worth spending a hundred bucks at a go and getting more than if you bought five twenty dollar kits (if you&#39;re going to do this, figure out how many legos to a pound so you have a means of comparison - bigger lots are sold by weight). <br/>
<br/>
For older kids, creating a fund for events can be handy - we rely heavily on Ray&#39;s bio mom to fund his trips to events and concerts as her financial contribution. <br/>

<br/>
Well, riding lessons? <br/>
<br/>
It will depend what your kids are interested in and what they want.  <br/>
<br/>
We tried to budget for gas money so we could take off anytime and explore.  We bought good rain coats, binoculars and day packs.  We bought maps of hiking trails and back roads. We bought field guides.  <br/>
<br/>
Some things that Dylan has enjoyed:  A back yard pool, trampoline, tools for building and lumber to build with, musical instruments, microscope, telescope, cameras and movie cameras, media players of all kinds, music, books, toys, art and art supplies, movies, games, outings, travel, museum visits, lessons (karate, tae kwon do, judo, swimming, piano) computers, TV, video games, kits and models, comic books, magazine subscriptions, symphony tickets.  <br/>
<br/>
What matters is what your kids want, what&#39;s fun for them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701560138">Let me suggest it&#39;s not what you choose but why you choose it, that will most affect your unschooling path.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose over the years we&#39;ve spent a thousand or two on college course videos from the Teaching Company -- not the most attractive name to unschoolers, is it? -- just the same way we buy a premium cable channel subscription and books, movies and music we want, and then enjoy.  We read the online catalogue descriptions out loud (generally doing overly dramatic or silly voices) and sometimes order a set of dvds that sounds especially fun, from Vikings and pirates to the stories behind constellations, Broadway musical history and Shakespeare.  <br/>
<br/>
But this is important: those things were not bought with any schooling motive, or as anything resembling curriculum. We spend a lot of money each year for one-on-one coaching when either child finds the right interest and the right mentor, such as singing and dancing for the stage, bagpiping, fencing and travel. Young Son just started spending an hour a week with a retired French teacher from the IB program here, and they really seem to enjoy each other so that&#39;s what makes it worth spending the money to me, not because it is &quot;educational&quot; and might look good on a school record. We never set aside any part of our budget or daily activities or our home (either in physical or psychic space) for &quot;school.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I come from a long line of teachers and college professors, school guidance counselors and perennial students. I loved school myself growing up and worked as a school librarian, elementary school principal and even state ed department official before having children and &quot;retiring&quot; to be a fulltime mom. Most of my friends were teachers even, so managing NOT to make home into school was my biggest personal challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Based on all that, I guess my two cents would be not spending even two cents on anything schoolish or curriculum-based! :)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767755449">***A globe<br/>
A BIG laminated world map (they are expensive!)***<br/>
<br/>
Borders change.  Names of countries change.  We did have fun with a globe  and we had it for years.  Most of the fun was in flying spaceships around it or hitting it with asteroids. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
Maps are available online when anyone wants to know about some particular country.   We did have a map of Germany on our wall when my nieces lived there but that was more for me, so I could find the cool places they were visiting.   I think, in many cases, maps appeal to adults more than children.   Relief maps are great for kids.  We had lots of dinosaur play on our relief map. <br/>
<br/>
***A nice balance scale***<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t have a balance scale but we had a kitchen scale that weighed bugs, rocks, letters, puzzle books, etc. &lt;g&gt;   We didn&#39;t have a practical use for a balance scale.<br/>
<br/>
***A solid brass microscope***<br/>
<br/>
Ours isn&#39;t solid brass but it&#39;s a good one.  We got it second hand from a vector control company that had the funding for new equipment and got rid of their old.  It&#39;s a binocular scope and the guy we got it from gave us a bunch of slides.  It was expensive to replace the lights for it when they quit, we had to get them mail order, but it&#39;s been working perfectly for the ten or eleven years we&#39;ve had it.  It lived on our dining room table for years, with egg cartons full of little things we collected to look at.   Lots of dead bugs. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
***A selection of really good music CDs of various styles***<br/>
<br/>
I probably wouldn&#39;t buy music nobody was interested in just to expose my kid to that style.  There&#39;s so much music online, there are music store where you can listen to different music, there are movies with soundtracks, there&#39;s theater, there&#39;s the library if somebody was really curious.    I would certainly buy music I like and that my kid likes, and we like a pretty wide variety of music here.   Dylan plays the organ and plays a lot of Baroque stuff.  He just bought a book of Gershwin music, those great old songs, and is learning some of those on the piano.  He plays church hymns. He plays Emerson Lake and Palmer stuff.   Broad range of music. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
***rosetta stone language***<br/>
<br/>
Again, I wouldn&#39;t spend money on a language course unless someone wanted it.  We got a Japanese course for Dylan when he was interested.  He&#39;s learning Italian from a Pimsleur course right now and watching movies in Italian and watching Italian TV online.   There are a lot of ways to hear other languages without springing for a course. There are foreign language films,  foreign language TV online, music online, travel, visits to ethnic restaurants, opera...<br/>
<br/>
Collecting cd&#39;s or buying a language course or a balance scale could get expensive and if your kid would rather have comic books and Heelys and a laptop that would be a better use of money. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286664768">I dont anticipate her wanting to go to camp.  She s asked me a couple of times if I ever went and what it was like but she shudders at the thought of going.  As for computers I m sure they would all love to have one but we dont put much stock in them, TV or video games.  We have a computer with lots of games and gets turned on a few times a year.  The TV averages one movie a week and my oldest has her own TV, VCR and PlayStation 2 that she uses maybe 3 times a month.  The gameboys are used even less.  I am thinking annual passes though.  We have a small childrens museum in our town, a small zoo about 35 miles from us where you can red the giraffes daily plus were about80 miles from a major metroplex so just about anything can be found there.<br/>

&gt;  &gt; My exhusband very much values education and is more then willing to pay for it to see that they get the best education. I have full custody and complete control of what school curriculum to buy/use. So should we switch to unschooling what things would you buy for unschooling? We usually buy a pricey curriculum and supplements. So what items or? Would you suggest buying in place of what we have been buying curriculum?<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;this is a link to their US Map. The maps are covered with little<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;cartoon<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;figures & information.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;When I first found the maps, I absolutely bought them for me (one of<br/>
&gt;&gt; the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;maps is Ancient History & Mythology...two subjects I love). But the<br/>
&gt;&gt; kids<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;love them too. They are neat to have because we&#39;re always finding<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; something<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;new on the maps that we hadn&#39;t seen before.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The globe we have is from Leap Frog and it plays a little folk music<br/>
&gt;&gt; from<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;each country as well as the nation anthem.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;As for the $1,000 - memberships to local zoos/science/kids museums work<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;great for us because we don&#39;t always have admission money....and we<br/>
&gt;&gt; really<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;do get our money&#39;s worth. (many of those types of places offer<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;reciprocal/discounted admission to other similar places around the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; country)<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Maybe a &quot;Things to Do&quot; in your city (or closest big city) book - you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247033010">Not really.  Sometimes one of the girls or myself will wish we had a computer with internet but we have access to the internet through my cell phone.  It does almost everything a computer will internet wise, we also have almost unlimited access to my sisters laptop that she never uses and it has high speed internet.  But honestly even one computer would probably be almost a waste of money for us.  We would use it sometimes but not a lot and then it would be just one more fancy toy we spent lots of money on to use very little.  Now if I couldn t email from my phone then it would get lots of use.  This is an addiction I need to break but I dont see how.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;As for computers I m sure they would all love to have one but we dont put much stock in them, TV or video games.  We have a computer with lots of games and gets turned on a few times a year.  The TV averages one movie a week and my oldest has her own TV, VCR and PlayStation 2 that she uses maybe 3 times a month&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have you thought about putting *more* stock into them?  Having a good working computer and a fast internet connection is the same as it would have been to have an entire library in your house when we were kids, times 10000.  If you don&#39;t have laptops and high speed internet for everyone in the house, that would be the top priority, imo.<br/>

Cell phones are great but their screen is very small and they are not like having a good fast computer.<br/>

I think the &quot;camp&quot; that was mentioned was Not Back To School Camp or something similar (I know there&#39;s an unschooling &quot;summer camp&quot; in TN this year, for instance). Those aren&#39;t &quot;camps&quot; in the way you experienced them, I guarantee it. They&#39;re more like unschooling conferences designed around the interests of kids rather than adults. Conferences, campouts and unschooling &quot;summer camps&quot; (including NBTSC) are all great ways to connect with other unschooling kids - something that can be really important for some families. My kids both look forward to the semi-annual unschooling campout in eastern TN and had a blast - two kids who tend not to get along with schooled age-peers. <br/>
<br/>
Half to two thirds of our travel as a family is to unschooling events. Its great to connect with people who aren&#39;t fighting with their kids (teens especially) all the time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518597867">If you like maps of all different kinds - current polititcal maps, georgraphic maps, historical maps, themed maps, its a great idea to subscribe to National Geographic. Its not all that expensive - stike that! its dirt cheap: $15 A Year in the US. Its nothing at all! especially considering all the use you can get out of the things - lots of pictures for kids of all ages to peruse and even cut up for projects, fascinating articles about other countries, history, science. Its a good deal. We have maps and posters hung around the house from Nat Geo magazine, its a longtime favorite. They have a kids magazine and a &quot;little kids&quot; magazine, <br/>

Their online store also sells maps and globes, although I haven&#39;t checked prices it looks like there&#39;s a sale going on:<br/>

use what they have access to much? Is there something they want that  <br/>
you&#39;re not seeing because you&#39;re not as into exploring as they are? Or  <br/>
do they want what they think a computer might offer but doesn&#39;t  <br/>
really? (I know my daughter wanted robots but what she really wanted  <br/>
was a creature that would interact with her so real robots were  <br/>
disappointing.)<br/>

You say &quot;we&quot; but that doesn&#39;t help clear thinking. Each family member  <br/>
is an individual. Are you mistaking the family culture you&#39;ve created  <br/>
through your preferences with what they like? Easy going people and  <br/>
people who like to do things in the company of others often go with  <br/>
the flow, but what they do says more about their personality than what  <br/>
they love doing.<br/>
<br/>
It helps others give advice that fits better when people focus on  <br/>
their kids needs and not mix in the parents&#39; needs and preferences  <br/>
that may be interfering with what the kids really want.<br/>
