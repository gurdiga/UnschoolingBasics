They keep saying how dangerous it is that more and<br/>
more children are going unvaccinated, but they can&#39;t<br/>
manage to cite any instances where an outbreak occured<br/>
because a child was unvaccinated. I have to wonder if<br/>
this is in retaliation to the latest articles that<br/>
claim vaccines are dangerous and ineffective. Or<br/>
simply a response by the drug manufacturers.<br/>

Well that makes NO sense at all!  If vaxes work- then all the vaxed kids<br/>
would be protected from all the diseases my child may have LOL<br/>

Well, the point is that vaccines work 80% of the time or something like that (probably varies with each disease), so if almost everybody&#39;s vaccinated then the risk of exposure goes way down and thus the 20% risk of actually getting the disease even when you&#39;re vaccinated becomes negligible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not arguing for vaccinating your children, just trying to explain the logic:-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636021407">I think a more relevant question is, what does anything have to NOT do<br/>
with RU?<br/>
<br/>
RU isn&#39;t about what to do/not to do, so much as encouraging people to<br/>
find their own answers, to educate themselves, and to become confident<br/>
in their ability to always do so.<br/>
<br/>
Educating one&#39;s self about vaccines can be a valuable part of<br/>
unschooling... to learn the risks and rewards of each vaccination and<br/>
each disease that it protects against, so that a person can decide for<br/>
themselves which, if any, vaccinations make sense for them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Educating one&#39;s self about health is certainly a valuble part of <br/>
parenting, but discussions about pros and cons of various health <br/>
practices can really bog down a message board. Posting links is a <br/>
great way to share information of this kind. <br/>
