<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296202448">Hi, we are considering a move to Paris that will probably last for two years. I am concerned about homeschooling laws and vaccination requirements there. I was hoping someone could either point me in the right direction or give me personal advice because of personal experience. Thanks so much. (we are unschoolers an my kids are 5 and 7)<br/>

<br/>
My sister lives in France and my understanding is that Homeschool laws are<br/>
similar to what we have in FL-- you register your intent to Homeschool and<br/>
then have yearly evaluations or tests. This organization is the big<br/>
homeschool group, she should contact them with any questions:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lesenfantsdabord.org/index.php">http://www.lesenfantsdabord.org/index.php</a> .<br/>
<br/>
As for vaccinations--I&#39;m not sure what the laws are, but I do know that<br/>
France&#39;s healthcare system allows for alternative health providers. My<br/>
sister was seeing a homeopath who advised her to stop vaccinating her kids.<br/>
She ended up still vaccinating but selectively and on an extended schedule.<br/>
But if the homeopath was advising it, I have to assume there&#39;s a legal way<br/>
to avoid vax.<br/>
<br/>
The next time I speak to my sis, I will ask for more info on that!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-662849039">Thanks this was helpful and along the same lines I found researching online. We will be there less than two years. I don&#39;t want to have to test at all!<br/>
<br/>
All my best--Kelli <br/>
