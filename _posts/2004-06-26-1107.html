<div id="ygrps-yiv-424203158">How did y&#39;all find UnschoolingBasics? Were you referred here from another<br/>
list? A friend? A website? Surfing?<br/>
<br/>
*****Referred from another list.  I think it might have been Always<br/>
Learning.<br/>
<br/>
Are you coming to unschooling from attachment parenting----like Robyn and<br/>
Rue and Deb? Or are you coming into it from a schooling background, like me<br/>
and<br/>
Pam and Ren?<br/>
<br/>
*************comiing from attachment parenting but I did have Alex in a<br/>
preschool Tues. Thurs. mornings at the insistence of his father.  It took<br/>
one year for dad to change his mind and become 100% supportive of fulltime<br/>
unschooling.  I do still struggle with a total no limits approach at home<br/>
though.  I am not ready for that yet.<br/>
<br/>
Are you looking at unschooling as a means of &quot;education&quot; only? Or do you<br/>
find it emcompassing your lives? Do you want to limit it to educational<br/>
things?<br/>
Or do you want it as a lifestyle?<br/>
<br/>
***********Good question.  Still iffy about it encompasing entire life.  I<br/>
believe in boundaries in regard to a messy house.  Food is something I offer<br/>
and try to focus on healthy choices but if he wants cookies after toast<br/>
that&#39;s fine with me.  Sleep is something that we do together.  Regardless of<br/>
whether he sleeps with dad or not he usually falls asleep around 9:30 or<br/>
10:100 and wakes up around 9:00.  I felt very guilty forcing him to wake up<br/>
to attend school last year and do not want to go through that again.  I am<br/>
coercive at times.  Yesterday, in 94 degree weather, I asked him to come to<br/>
the shady area on the blanket, have some water and cool down.  So I do<br/>
interfere at times and set limits for his health so he does not get over<br/>
heated but he is four and that is where I am with it at the moment.  I guess<br/>
I am in a still learning along the way mode and unsure because the<br/>
definitions still seem sort of vague to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 We want you to feel comfortable enough to ask anything, but at the same<br/>
time, to be accepting of all the answers you get. Each answer may not fit<br/>
your<br/>
particular situation, but there might be something there for the *next*<br/>
reader----so it&#39;s just as valuable, just not necessarily to *you*.<br/>
<br/>
***Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 So, to those of you clinging on to the edge of the pool, we&#39;re here in the<br/>
middle yelling. &quot;The water&#39;s FINE!&quot; We&#39;re fairly trustworthy. I promise!<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
**** I do hesitate sometime&#39;s because I have an underlying fear if I<br/>
disagree or share my life situation I am going to be screamed at and told to<br/>
go away and that I am not a true unschooler.  Sink or swim I am jumping in.<br/>
