<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268313769">unschoolingbasicsBut I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever useful for building relationships to <br/>
label what someone else likes as stupid or dumb or boring or anything <br/>
negative. There are gentler, kinder, more relationship building ways <br/>
of sharing our likes and dislikes without using judgmental words. <br/>
Even if the members of a family don&#39;t find the words hurtful, there <br/>
will be other people outside the family who will be put off and feel <br/>
put down. And that&#39;s a good thing for kids to know, even if their <br/>
family is less sensitive.<br/>

**Well, then we disagree. I think the way my family relates is terrific -- including less-than-perfectly-gentle opinions sometimes -- and if the rest of the world wants to be offended by the way we discuss TV shows, well, they should get a hobby. :)<br/>
<br/>
**There are times when kinder and gentler are appropriate and times when it is OK to speak your mind. I&#39;m not suggesting my kids go out in the world and pick fights about TV shows. But people have different tastes and that&#39;s OK. Everyone isn&#39;t all that fragile.<br/>

****<br/>
Sensitivity has not a thing to do with being fragile.  Kinder and<br/>
gentler are always appropriate.  It is possible to speak one&#39;s mind,<br/>
while being kind and gentle. <br/>
<br/>
Earlier in this topic you said &quot;he is a Jets fan after all. He&#39;s used<br/>
to disdain.&quot; and I just cringed.  I realize you weren&#39;t talking to me<br/>
directly -- I overheard you much as I might at a gathering.  My first<br/>
thought, tho, was &quot;are all sports fans that mean-spirited towards each<br/>
other?&quot;  My next thought was to wonder why you would joke about your<br/>
husband being used to disdain.  My response is not because I&#39;m<br/>
fragile, but because I really think a kinder world is a good thing,<br/>
and every little kindness helps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The rest of the world is not offended by what you do in your home.<br/>
<br/>
The list is for ideas that move people towards unschooling and  <br/>
improve relationships. We&#39;re discussing ideas. If you&#39;ve thrown an  <br/>
idea onto the list that only works with the personalities in your  <br/>
home, it&#39;s not useful to the list.<br/>
<br/>
My family can probably do more teasing than some families. I don&#39;t  <br/>
advocate teasing. It&#39;s not a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and times when it is OK to speak your mind<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is an aspect where the conversation seems to go wrong. You&#39;re  <br/>
saying that &quot;I don&#39;t like that show because of x, y, and z.&quot; is not  <br/>
speaking your mind, but saying &quot;That&#39;s dumb,&quot; is.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some more where you&#39;re saying people *aren&#39;t* doing this who  <br/>
aren&#39;t using judgmental words:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Actually, quite the opposite. I think it frees them to decide what  <br/>
&gt; they like for themselves. With or without my enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter neither needs my enthusiasm or approval to like   <br/>
something. And she&#39;s achieved that without hearing me call things I  <br/>
don&#39;t like stupid.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Nobody HAS to watch what the other wants to watch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one does in our house, either.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We went through the things where I pretended to be interested when  <br/>
&gt; they were very young.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I *showed* interest in her interests. I did things she liked that I  <br/>
was indifferent to (and let my husband handle the things I really  <br/>
didn&#39;t like). I don&#39;t remember pretending interest.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And watching TV around here has always been an interactive activity  <br/>
&gt; anyway. We have always sliced and diced ads, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As do we. But we don&#39;t need to call things dumb to have a  <br/>
conversation. Dumb and stupid -- in general, perhaps not in your  <br/>
family -- can be conversation stoppers. What does one say to &quot;That&#39;s  <br/>
dumb&quot;? &quot;No, it&#39;s not.&quot;? It&#39;s helpful to get kids to draw out what  <br/>
they like and don&#39;t like. Dumb doesn&#39;t really communicate anything.  <br/>
It&#39;s a vague word whose meaning is specific to the person using it.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s not meant for your family. It&#39;s meant for anyone who is  <br/>
still reading along and hadn&#39;t ever really thought about it. (Or had  <br/>
conversations stopped by &quot;That was good.&quot; or &quot;That was stupid.&quot; and  <br/>
didn&#39;t know why.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t know -- we just aren&#39;t required to assign value to things  <br/>
&gt; because the other person likes it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And no one is saying that either. There are so many ideas you&#39;re  <br/>
pulling out of the suggestion that there are better ways to  <br/>
communicate than judgmental words that just aren&#39;t part of what is  <br/>
going on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But he knows, as the kids know, that the disdain is for the game --  <br/>
&gt; or those cars all driving very fast while turning left, what the  <br/>
&gt; heck is entertaining about that! -- and not him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And it&#39;s very helpful for kids out in the world to realize that some  <br/>
people *do* feel judged when what they like is judged negatively.  <br/>
Without that awareness those kids are going to hurt without realizing  <br/>
it. And it won&#39;t help those kids if the attitude is that people can  <br/>
be dismissed as &quot;too sensitive&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re family isn&#39;t aware. I am discussing the idea in  <br/>
a general way for other people to pick up and examine.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not going to suggest others should live the way we do<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And no one suggests others should live the way the frequent posters  <br/>
on the list do either (even though it seems like it!) The list is for  <br/>
people who want to figure out how to move toward unschooling and how  <br/>
to build better relationships. It&#39;s an implied contract that the  <br/>
posters here will provide that kind of information. Any ideas tossed  <br/>
into the general pool will get examined against those goals. Any  <br/>
ideas that moved away will be given critical examination.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093444324">unschoolingbasicsWell, we are unschoolers and have good relationships.<br/>
<br/>
Not every happy unschooling family will look the same.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that is the reason you find certain words unhelpful and I find the idea of forbidding certain words unhelpful to anyone looking to live as a happy unschooling family.<br/>
