<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271807326">Just to let all you newbies know that you&#39;re in for a real treat----if we  <br/>
can keep her here! &lt;g&gt; Anne Ohman just signed up! She&#39;s not a fan of  e-lists; <br/>
but if she stays, you&#39;ll be inspired by what she has to offer!<br/>
 <br/>
Glad you&#39;re here, Anne!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932408836">&quot;I just got an e-mail from Ren with a link to this group at the <br/>
bottom<br/>
of it ~ so I joined! And I just wanted to write about John Holt ~&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well dang! If I&#39;d known it was THAT easy to getcha here, I would <br/>
have sent you a link a long time ago.:)<br/>
<br/>
Glad you came to the party Anne....hope you stay.<br/>
<br/>
OH, and I also felt a deep sense of loss when I found out John Holt <br/>
had died before I ever read a book he wrote. I still feel that loss <br/>
when I read a great quote from him...like the unschooling community <br/>
has lost something really profound and important that we NEED.<br/>
