<div id="ygrps-yiv-270759326">Hello there,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say a quick hello - I&#39;m Amy, and my husband Simon and I<br/>
have a nine year old son, Sam (and one on the way, due in April!<br/>
That&#39;s called expert planning), who has always been homeschooled. I&#39;m<br/>
from Iowa, Simon&#39;s from England; we lived in IA for about the first<br/>
five years of our marriage, then northern CA for a year, then near<br/>
Seattle for about 7 months, then Fort Worth, Texas for another 6<br/>
months, then back here to Iowa two years ago. We&#39;re not a military<br/>
family, just people with extreme wanderlust - we&#39;re trying to make<br/>
ourselves stay in one place for a while, maybe for good. :D <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am just beginning to explore unschooling for Sam, even<br/>
though I suppose he&#39;s been unschooled in some way his whole life. I&#39;ve<br/>
tried the extremely structured/tightly scheduled school at home<br/>
approach, and Sam just is not into it. I&#39;m still not exactly sure what<br/>
it means to unschool, however - do I literally not use any formal<br/>
texts or workbooks? Right now, as I type, he&#39;s behind me at the<br/>
kitchen table, doing a few pages in a maps & geography workbook, and<br/>
is more or less enjoying/tolerating it. I have this deep seated fear<br/>
that I&#39;m not teaching him properly/well enough/to someone else&#39;s<br/>
standard. I suppose that is my buggest hurdle.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I am interested in unschooling is that Sam is a very<br/>
imaginative person (his supervising teacher says that he&#39;s gifted, and<br/>
I, of course, have always thought the same! :)), and when he&#39;s<br/>
interested in something, is able to learn a great deal about it. Right<br/>
now, it&#39;s military &quot;special ops&quot; thanks to the video game series<br/>
&quot;Metal Gear Solid;&quot; a while back, it was Yu-Gi-Oh! I think he would<br/>
benefit from unschooling because he&#39;s already doing his own thing most<br/>
of the time, anyway! :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enough typing from me. Any thoughts you might have for a new<br/>
unschooler would be wonderful. Thanks in advance!<br/>

<br/>
Basically in a nutshell, if your son wants to learn<br/>
something from a workbook or textbook, don&#39;t stop him.<br/>
But don&#39;t say he &quot;has&quot; to either. Let him choose what<br/>
and how he wants to learn.<br/>

Your biggest hurdle is to teach to someone else&#39;s standard ? Or to get  over <br/>
that idea that someone else&#39;s opinion matters?<br/>

 <br/>
We&#39;ll suggest that you get rid of the &quot;gifted&quot; label. Just let him be who  he <br/>
is with all his strengths. Let his strengths shine through----and don&#39;t worry <br/>
 about his &quot;weaknesses----they don&#39;t define him.<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s called intrinsic motivation. It&#39;s true of all of us! And that&#39;s what  <br/>
unschooling is all about----to learn what you need to know when you need to know <br/>
 it. <br/>

our own. Some people in my extended family are hyper-critical of,<br/>
well, everything, homeschooling included. Got to quit worryin&#39; about<br/>
what they think! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-481195787">&quot;and when he&#39;s<br/>

<br/>
Just like all human beings.:)<br/>
Interest is the basic foundation of unschooling. If a child has interest in something, or sees a need for information because it will help them with an interest, they&#39;ll absorb it readily. We&#39;re all like that. That&#39;s the way humans are. <br/>
Make a list for yourself of all the jobs you&#39;ve done for pay, the ones you&#39;ve volunteered, all of the hobbies you&#39;ve had or plan to have and then ask yourself how much of this stuff you learned in school?<br/>
Usually none or just a few. And of the few that you might have learned in school, it&#39;s only because the school happened to be teaching something you were already interested in.<br/>
Things like reading, math, writing, come along as people are exploring their interests. Focusing on &quot;teaching&quot; those as subjects, only sucks the joy out of learning.<br/>
Listen to your child, he already knows how to be an unschooler...kids are naturals that way. Your schooled mind is getting in the way some, so just let him show you the way back to yourself, it&#39;s easy once you start.:)<br/>
