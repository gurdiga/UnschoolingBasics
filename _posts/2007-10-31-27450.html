<div id="ygrps-yiv-863541125">I have a question about unschooling in NC -- Right now I&#39;m preparing<br/>
for my oldest son, as preschool for the younger twins isn&#39;t too<br/>
&quot;schooly&quot; yet.  NC seems to require annual testing and for the results<br/>
to be on file, privy to official inspection.  How does this fit into<br/>
unschooling?  <br/>
<br/>
We live in Walkertown near Winston-Salem so it would be great to know<br/>
of any local groups. :D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-194176491">I think most NC unschoolers do something like the PASS test which you<br/>
administer at home (and there are others like that). Once it&#39;s taken,<br/>
the results are simply filed away unopened just in case someone asks to<br/>
see it (which apparently is pretty rare from what I&#39;ve heard).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404960994">Yep - that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done. The results are not important to the<br/>
state at all - only that you have administered the test. There&#39;s no<br/>
minimum level the students need to reach, and you can actually<br/>
determine for yourself which grade level they&#39;ll be tested at. It&#39;s<br/>
really easy, no stress at all.<br/>
<br/>
I do the test *with* my boys. And the PASS test isn&#39;t timed, but if it<br/>
was, I would not set a timer. Seems silly to me. My oldest is now past<br/>
the age level for PASS. I&#39;m not sure what we&#39;re doing this year, but<br/>
whatever it is, it won&#39;t involve him sitting in a room by himself,<br/>
trying to beat a timer! Full access to information is how we live our<br/>
lives, so it&#39;s how we take the test. It&#39;s just another form to fill<br/>
out to stay in compliance with the very minimal laws here.<br/>
<br/>
Are you a member of NCUnschoolers? It&#39;s a great way to meet<br/>
like-minded folks in your area:<br/>
