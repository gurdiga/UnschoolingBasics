Last night, Sierra and Jalen flipped on the tv right as we were <br/>
getting ready to go to sleep...it was &quot;Boa&quot; (scary flick for anyone <br/>
that hasn&#39;t seen the previews) and a snake was in the process of <br/>
attacking and eating a human. I just said &quot;you know Sierra, I don&#39;t <br/>

something not scary.&quot; She quickly changed it to cartoon network. If <br/>
they&#39;d both said &quot;NO, we want to watch this&quot; I would have stayed and <br/>
let them watch.<br/>
So while I think addressing these issues are important, I don&#39;t take <br/>
the choice from them either.<br/>
I&#39;ve never had any kind of tv/movie cause nightmares for weeks. I <br/>
think it&#39;s in part how WE handle it when something disturbing gets <br/>
viewed that we maybe weren&#39;t prepared for. We are calm, we talk <br/>
about the special effects it took to prepare that scene, we dicuss <br/>
how nothing was really harmed in real life, my children don&#39;t see <br/>
everyone reacting intensely, so they tend to discuss, rather than be <br/>
reactive.<br/>
Sierra used to be extremely sensitive.<br/>
I still warn her about a lot, but she is also very much needing to <br/>
be in control of her choices, so she&#39;s seen things that upset her.<br/>
It&#39;s a learning opportunity, it doesn&#39;t damage anyone for life.<br/>
The worst that&#39;s come of disturbing scenes is I have to walk small <br/>
people to the bathroom for several weeks...sigh.<br/>
<br/>
There are always issues that arise when a family is trying to <br/>
balance everyone&#39;s needs. That doesn&#39;t mean the parent&#39;s need to <br/>
override the child&#39;s choices. If they make a choice that isn&#39;t <br/>
great, they&#39;ll learn something new about themselves. And hopefully <br/>
it&#39;s being learned with parent&#39;s that discuss what disturbed them <br/>
and don&#39;t say &quot;I told you so&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476604985">Thanks for clarifying, Ren.  I definitely rephrased what you said poorly<br/>
using the word &quot;have&quot;, and in my mind I definitely wasn&#39;t thinking that you<br/>
said or that I would believe that the adult would choose what&#39;s too scary<br/>
and what&#39;s not, just that the adult would be aware and talk about it with<br/>
their child.  I would not stop my daughter from watching something she<br/>
wished to if she wanted to try it because I thought it was too scary.  I<br/>
would only explain why I was concerned about it - it would definitely be up<br/>
to her to choose unless there was an issue with her brother feeling<br/>
threatened by it which might mean seeing it while he was asleep or<br/>
distracting him or some such.<br/>
<br/>
It is my own ongoing challenge that my daughter is more sensitive than any<br/>
other child I have met so far in regards not only to TV, but to books and<br/>
other materials.  She is not reading yet, and before asking for anything to<br/>
be read to her insists on looking through it at all the pictures to see if<br/>
she thinks it would be &quot;too scary&quot;.  For this reason, much to my husband&#39;s<br/>
dismay as he is a librarian, she has no interest in storytime at the<br/>
library - too big of a risk it might be something scary.  If I read a book<br/>
aloud to my son and she doesn&#39;t want to hear it, she goes to another room<br/>
and I make sure I read softly.  Because she not only watches, but feels she<br/>
is living in the video, like the books, she finds an amazing (to me) list of<br/>
things scary including even some of the mildest children&#39;s videos out<br/>
there - even one Little Bear episode made her list.  Anything representative<br/>
of adult crankiness and insensitivity seems to set her off, although she<br/>
often asks and we discuss &quot;why&quot; it happened that way if she happens to see<br/>
it.  As she gets older, she seems to take some of it more in stride.<br/>
Personally I do not question what she finds scary or not scary - if she<br/>
finds it scary, then it is and we go from there, although sometimes I see if<br/>
she would like to discuss what she finds scary about it to see if that helps<br/>
her feel better in a given situation.<br/>
<br/>
She has not had anything on a video that has given her nightmares for weeks,<br/>
although she has seen things that have sent her out of the room screaming<br/>
(like the mean witch on &quot;Dora Saves the Prince&quot;), and by saying that in my<br/>
post, I may simply be expressing an unrealistic worry of mine - we are<br/>
currently trying to handle a situation where she felt threatened by the<br/>
behavior of some other children while in a childcare situation during<br/>
regular 3 hour meetings we attended - she found the behavior scary and the<br/>
providers there did not help her feel safe, and she has had recurrent<br/>
nightmares about that going on 3 months now.  So I have likely put my own<br/>
struggles and fears into my rephrase and not anything well thought out about<br/>
videos, and certainly not anything reflective of what you wrote!<br/>
