<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291154381">I was just about to post a comment about the &quot;Madonna is a jerk&quot; post <br/>
when I realized I haven&#39;t even introduced myself!  So, here I go:<br/>
My name is Christina, married for 6 years to John and we live in MA.  <br/>
We have three children:  a dd age 4.5, a dd age 2.5 and a ds age 1.  <br/>
I am consumed with the idea of homeschooling and most interested in <br/>
unschooling as a way of life for us.<br/>
<br/>
However, we aren&#39;t there yet.  My oldest is in a Montessori preschool <br/>
right now which she really enjoys and we are relatively happy with <br/>
her there.  But, I REALLY dislike having her away from us every <br/>
afternoon; frankly, I just MISS her and feel like I&#39;ve given up <br/>
something in order to put her in the best preschool I could find (and <br/>
afford).  <br/>
<br/>
So, here we are with about 6 homeschool books, 10 websites, and a new <br/>
homeschool playgroup.  My dh is totally supportive but our town has <br/>
very few homeschoolers (although I&#39;ve been told the superintendent is <br/>
supportive).  <br/>
<br/>
My biggest &#39;obstacle&#39; is just trying to understand unschooling better <br/>
and also wanting to hear from others with very young children.  My <br/>
oldest is very smart, curious, asks tons of questions; but she also <br/>
LOVES TV and I try to limit how much she watches which, I think, is <br/>
very &#39;unschooler&#39; of me.  With the little ones still being so <br/>
demanding and unable to do very much by themselves, how do I provide <br/>
her with a learning environment and &#39;be there&#39; for her when I&#39;m <br/>
trying to also take care of the youngest ones?    <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve looked at Danielle&#39;s inspiring and wonderful website and first <br/>
thought, &#39;yay, her kids are spaced like mine; I can do this!&#39;.  And <br/>
then I thought, &#39;oh my God, she sounds incredibly smart and educated <br/>
and resourceful---I am totally intimidated!&quot;  lol---Danielle, please <br/>
take that as a huge compliment from me!  But, for you and others who <br/>
did this with young children, I&#39;d love any words that will help me <br/>
get my head around this idea.  I keep thinking about how I will go <br/>
about &#39;teaching&#39; my oldest when the little ones are taking up so much <br/>
of my time: how do I let go of this way of thinking?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sticking with this long-winded post!  Oh, and my Madonna <br/>
post was going to say, &quot;I see a Mommy Dearest-type movie in her <br/>
future&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
Welcome Christina!   This is a great place for newbies to unschooling!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My dh is totally supportive but our town has very few homeschoolers <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(although I&#39;ve been told the superintendent is supportive).&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in MA too (No Reading - what town are you in?) and there are very <br/>
few homeschoolers in my town, mostly younger kids (my dd is 13 and <br/>
just finished 6th grade, this is our first year and she&#39;s deschooling <br/>
big time).   Have you checked ahem.info and mhla.org for support <br/>
groups near you?  I think we&#39;re the only unschoolers in my town and <br/>
the only homeschoolers above the elementary level, but by joining a <br/>
homeschool group, even though many do &quot;school at home&quot; and many <br/>
variations and combinations of it, I&#39;m also beginning to find other <br/>
unschoolers with teens in nearby towns (and beyond but having one <br/>
child who&#39;s older, we&#39;re willing to travel).<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My biggest &#39;obstacle&#39; is just trying to understand unschooling <br/>

children.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are families here who have unschooled from the beginning, those <br/>
with young kids in situations similar to you and those like me who <br/>
pulled a child from school at an older age, so I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get <br/>
some input!   Keep reading, asking questions.     <br/>

<br/>
The first step is to let go of the idea that you need to &quot;teach&quot; her at all. She&#39;s learning all the time. Really. Talk to her, play when you can, include her in your world with the little ones.<br/>
<br/>
What exactly are you thinking she needs to learn right now that won&#39;t come up in the course of your everyday lives? At 4 1/2 the schools are doing numbers, letters, colors...I think you can handle that! As the kids get older and you get used to the idea of unschooling, you&#39;ll find that the learning grows naturally with the kids.<br/>

loudly, &#39;wow, isn&#39;t this YELLOW banana something else?&#39; She had a <br/>
bag of Skittles and was sorting them by color and I asked her what <br/>
colors she had and how many of each, but not sure if this <br/>
is &#39;interfering&#39; or just &#39;interacting&#39;---I think I&#39;m getting caught <br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Eeeeek! I&#39;m not supposed to be intimidating (shaking my head, &quot;no, no, no&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I recently did a kind of how-to funshop on my web stuff at the Live and <br/>
Learn Conference, and my dh kept laughing and saying that my whole <br/>
exigence for being able to do that was, &quot;If *I* can do this, you can <br/>
too!&quot; because I know so little about computers and html. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I just *love* to learn, about just about anything--from html <br/>
to gardening to science to foreign affairs. I think that&#39;s all it takes <br/>
is a genuine love of learning and curiosity that most people have; it&#39;s <br/>
just buried a bit deeper for some than for others.<br/>
<br/>
The glory of unschooling is that you live and learn with your kids--ALL <br/>
of them. Learning is a by-product of living a rich, interesting life, so <br/>
you don&#39;t have to worry about how you&#39;ll &quot;teach&quot; the oldest or how much <br/>
time the little ones are taking. Life and interests intertwine, <br/>
absorbing all ages and stages. Sometimes it seems like the youngest ones <br/>
learn by pure osmosis because they absorb so much from the interests and <br/>
questions of the oldest ones, but then you see the same thing working <br/>
the other direction. Once they become available, you may want to order <br/>
Ren&#39;s conference talk &quot;Unschooling a Tribe.&quot; She said so many wonderful <br/>
things about what it&#39;s like to unschool many children--really valuable.<br/>
<br/>
I spend most of my time at the AlwaysUnschooled list, which I co-own <br/>
with Robyn Coburn, and there are lots of people there talking about how <br/>
they do this with young children. Read here; read there, but mostly just <br/>
start *living* it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-855958436">Welcome Christina.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure you will get lots of good information and advice here.  Just<br/>
hanging out and reading other peoples posts will be helpful to you.  My .02<br/>
are just about leaving dd in Montessori.  There was a beautiful Montessori<br/>
near us when my oldest was little.  So, I&#39;m going to say to you what I&#39;d say<br/>
to the younger me if I could go back in time.  The minute your child doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to go to school one day, let her stay home.  Ask her each morning&quot;<br/>
Would you like to go to school today? or would you rather stay home with<br/>
us?&quot;  Honor her wishes.  If the school starts giving you a hard time,<br/>
weather it yourself.  Her desire to be there may look different when it is a<br/>
genuine choice of hers.  Keep a close eye on how adults treat and talk to<br/>
her and be there to advocate for her.  <br/>
 <br/>
It was a great school as schools go and lovely in many ways but the harm<br/>
done was real and if I could go back to start again, I&#39;d have kept my kids<br/>
home from the start.  <br/>
 <br/>
Like I said, just my .02<br/>
Best wishes for your journey,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The same way you helped her discover and learn new things before she became school age. In our family it just came up in everyday interactions. We&#39;d read books, use crayons and paint, talk and share. I&#39;d point out the pretty yellow daffodils or ask for the purple crayon or use the red paint on my fire engine.<br/>

Of course! But, it&#39;s so magical watching them learn. It&#39;s like watching a  <br/>
butterfly emerge from its cocoon and take flight. My daughter is learning colors <br/>
 on her own. She will soon be 4. She has learned shapes as well. Totally from <br/>
 being HER. She has learned from her big brother, from TV, from toys... and <br/>
on  her own choosing and asking a gazillion questions. And, we play games. The  <br/>
&quot;pick-up&quot; game is a &quot;fun&quot; one since it&#39;s never really the same each time. I <br/>
have  the 2 older ones &quot;race&quot; to pick up 5 toys with wheels, or 3 red toys, or <br/>
4  squares. We mix it up. Makes the chore of picking up fun for them.<br/>
But, the learning &quot;happens&quot;. Just because... :o)  <br/>

The only reason that they &quot;have&quot; to know their colors<br/>

good enough marks to get &quot;passed&quot; to kindergarten.<br/>
<br/>

books have colors and names of colors, she&#39;ll learn<br/>
them as you go through these years naturally.  :-)  I<br/>
can say  that with peace because my 7yo dd learned<br/>
them that way, before I even knew about unschooling or<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426438720">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I guess I don&#39;t understand how to promote learning <br/>
without &#39;teaching&#39;. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By making the cognitive leap yourself that learning is a natural human<br/>
drive, that learning is unstoppable. It doesn&#39;t need promotion, especially<br/>
in these littlies. It is impossible to prevent learning from occurring, but<br/>
easy to make the learning something negative such as &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;, or &quot;I&#39;m not<br/>
as smart as the other kids in my class&quot;, or something like &quot;I have to keep<br/>
my interests secret (because Mom disapproves)&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; For example, you said in schools they are learning colors at 4 1/2. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Without recollecting that particular post, looking at that statement reminds<br/>
me of just how arbitrary and silly the school timetables for learning are.<br/>
I&#39;m sure Jayn knew all the colors in her life much sooner than that, but nor<br/>
was it at all important that she should be able to name them outside of her<br/>
needs or enjoyment. <br/>
<br/>
I remember when she was watching a Max and Ruby and Ruby said to Max, &quot;You<br/>
have to go to school to learn how to mix colors&quot;. Not only is that an<br/>
outrageous lie in real life, it was a lie within the context of the show,<br/>
since Max had just learnt how to mix colors *from Ruby*. It was a phrase<br/>
that Ruby was using as a device to control Max&#39;s behavior - she wanted to<br/>
exclude him from her art game. <br/>
<br/>
We are freed from needing to bring schoolish agendas and lies into our<br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  If I&#39;m unschooling her, how do I help her <br/>
learn colors?  By asking her what color she is wearing?  By saying <br/>
loudly, &#39;wow, isn&#39;t this YELLOW banana something else?&#39; She had a <br/>
bag of Skittles and was sorting them by color and I asked her what <br/>
colors she had and how many of each, but not sure if this <br/>
is &#39;interfering&#39; or just &#39;interacting&#39;---&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t you know what color her dress was? Beware of inauthentic speech<br/>
instigated by your educational goals or hidden teaching agenda. <br/>
<br/>
I would call the Skittles conversation &quot;quizzing&quot;. I define this as asking<br/>
questions to which you already know the answer, with the transparent purpose<br/>
being to test her knowledge (or lack thereof). Looks like you snuck in some<br/>
bonus math quizzing as well! If Jayn were sorting something small like that,<br/>
I might support it by asking her if she wanted some containers.<br/>
<br/>
Kids will only put up with so much quizzing before they start wanting to<br/>
avoid having conversations with you. Generous children will put up with more<br/>
than impatient ones.<br/>
<br/>
Is conversation with you something you want your child to &quot;put up with&quot; or<br/>
seek to avoid in the future? Try not to quiz. Really, in your heart, let go<br/>
of that need.<br/>
<br/>
Colors come up in real conversations all the time. Colors come up in real<br/>
descriptions (&quot;I want the PINK doll Mommy, not the purple one&quot;). Jayn worked<br/>
out how to make new colors from painting. She asked what the names of colors<br/>
were as they came up in real life. Your dd is already interested in color<br/>
differences as shown by her self-instigated sorting game. This is the kind<br/>
of ubiquitous and useful real knowledge that you would have to actively and<br/>
assiduously avoid if you wanted your child to NOT learn it for some insane<br/>
reason. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  To just &#39;let go&#39; and let her learn <br/>
on her own sounds so SCARY to me; has anyone else had to deal with <br/>
this? &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Fear is cast out by Trust. Trust is enhanced and facilitated by observation.<br/>
Spend time just observing your child. That continues to be the greatest<br/>
source reassurance I ever find. Don&#39;t do the schoolish thing and look for<br/>
the deficits and lacks. Look at what is actually happening. It will be more,<br/>
and more wondrous, than you could design.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-319772814">I&#39;ve told this story before, so sorry for the repeat for those who&#39;ve  <br/>
heard it - but a year or so ago, my 14 yo daughter, Rose, was walking  <br/>
off the soccer field back to the parking lot with a friend. I was  <br/>
walking behind them and could hear their conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Her friend asked her, &quot;So I still don&#39;t get what you do - how do you  <br/>
LEARN anything if you don&#39;t go to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rose: &quot;Like what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Friend: &quot;Well, like science.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rosie: &quot;Like what kind of science.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Friend: &quot;Well, like formulas and stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rose: &quot;Formulas for what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Friend: &quot;Science formulas like gravity and mass and stuff like that.  <br/>
I mean, we learn them and have to take tests on them. How do you  <br/>
learn them if you don&#39;t go to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rose: &quot;I don&#39;t know. Tell me one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Friend: &quot;Well, I we just had a test so right now I don&#39;t remember any  <br/>
more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rose: &quot;Well, if you remember any of them, tell them to me, then I&#39;ll  <br/>
know them too. That&#39;s one way I learn, I ask people to tell me things  <br/>
THEY know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d arrived at the parking lot and the friend was clearly not  <br/>
satisfied with these answers - the conversation continued another  <br/>
time, according to Rosie, but I wasn&#39;t there. The friend apparently  <br/>
even asked Rosie, &quot;So if you NEVER went to school, how did you learn  <br/>
ANYTHING, like how did you learn to tie your shoes?&quot; Rosie says she  <br/>
was surprised by THAT question and asked her friend, &quot;Did you learn  <br/>
to tie your shoes in school?&quot; The friend looked bewildered and said,  <br/>
&quot;Yeah, well, I think so, I mean I&#39;m pretty sure.&quot;  Then the friend  <br/>
said, &quot;I still don&#39;t get how you learn stuff.&quot; AGAIN, Rosie said,  <br/>
&quot;Like what?&quot; Friend: &quot;Like where is Bulgaria?&quot; (Totally out of  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725671888">Thank you for this (and Robyn, your post as well). The part about <br/>
the friend, having just taken a test on formulas, but not <br/>
remembering any of them, was exactly like me in school.  I could <br/>
take a test like the best of &#39;em, but as soon as the test was over, <br/>
I&#39;d forget everything I had crammed into my head.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I think Robyn mentioned I need to avoid quizzing my dd.  This <br/>
is a tough one for me and I know I&#39;ll be a work in progress.  I <br/>
think my younger dd figured me out and now, if asked what color <br/>
something is, answers &#39;blue&#39; to everything, with a sly smile on her <br/>
lips.  My oldest, if she doesn&#39;t want to discuss something, just <br/>
puts her hands over her ears.  At least they are pretty obvious!  <br/>
Mama needs to back off!<br/>
<br/>
One question:  my oldest (who is 4.5) has been &#39;playing&#39; with math, <br/>
specifically adding and counting.  She has been saying things <br/>
like &#39;2 plus 2 equals 4&#39;.  If she says 2 plus 2 equals 5&#39;, do I just <br/>
keep my mouth shut, or correct her, or ask her to think about it <br/>
some more?  She will sometimes ask me if she is right or not with a <br/>
math problem.  First of all, I am blown away that she is even doing <br/>
any of this.  I also want to be &#39;there&#39; for her if she needs me but <br/>
do not want to interfere in her exploration and thought.  <br/>

Thanks again for your comments,<br/>

I usually keep my mouth shut!  Most of the incorrect thoughts don&#39;t  really <br/>
matter at this age and much of the time, they correct themselves if there  is a <br/>
need.  If I can see there will be potential for much frustration, I  might <br/>
ask if they want my help.  I try really hard not to get into a  position where I <br/>
am *right* and they are *wrong*.  <br/>
 <br/>
We all have incorrect thoughts all the time.  You might think  your <br/>
neighbor&#39;s name is Jim but then you find out it is Bob.   No big  deal, right?  You <br/>
just replace the new information with the outdated or  wrong stuff.  Kids&#39; brains <br/>
are far more pliable than ours!  When they  find out they are wrong, <br/>
especially if no shame or negativity has been attached  to it, they change their <br/>
minds.  <br/>

<br/>
I can tell the difference in Jayn&#39;s voice and tone between what is<br/>
essentially her thinking aloud, and her asking me for input. In her case,<br/>
using your example, she might say, &quot;2 and 2 are 4 (or 5), right?&quot; and it is<br/>
very clear that she wants the answer from me.<br/>
<br/>
Other than her asking, I don&#39;t correct her. Sometimes she is playing a kind<br/>
of game with herself, stating the wrong answer in a kind of logic think fest<br/>
much like how sometimes she will deliberately choose the wrong answer in a<br/>
computer game to see what happens. Sometimes, especially when she was the<br/>
age your child is, she would simply be forgetting the right word, kinda<br/>
thinking &quot;4&quot; but saying &quot;5&quot;. She would do that with other types of<br/>
vocabulary also, mixing &quot;less&quot; and &quot;more&quot; or &quot;yesterday&quot; and &quot;tomorrow&quot; -<br/>
although she was clear on the actual concepts. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn self-corrects in time, often immediately, sometimes by asking. The<br/>
important thing is not to make her feel embarrassed about asking for the<br/>
correct answer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-148935910">Say this, to yourself: &quot;Wow - what an amazing child I have - such a  <br/>
smart little human being who loves to learn and is curious about the  <br/>
world and is clearly intent on exploring all she can about it. Do I  <br/>
really think she&#39;ll never figure out that 2 plus 2 is 4, not 5?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you REALLY think she&#39;ll never get that figured out, then by all  <br/>
means be sure to tell her &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
But, sorry - that was sarcasm. You do NOT have to make sure she  <br/>
learns things like this - they are important and real and will appear  <br/>
in her life over and over - there is no need for you to do ANYTHING  <br/>
except live a happy, full life. You do NOT need to either engineer  <br/>
her learning OR make sure she learns when the opportunity does  <br/>
present itself. There will always be more opportunities, don&#39;t worry  <br/>
about that. 2 plus 2 will continue to be 4, over and over, in many  <br/>
situations! What you have to be careful about is damaging the  <br/>
natural, inherent deeply built-in urge to learn. You can do that,  <br/>
easily, by jumping in to &quot;teach&quot; when unnecessary and/or unwelcome.  <br/>
TRUST that natural curiosity will lead her to question, wonder, and  <br/>
observe and experiment and think for herself. Strew her path with  <br/>
opportunities to have fun, to discover interesting things, and so on.  <br/>
But don&#39;t think that if you don&#39;t TELL her something, that she won&#39;t  <br/>
learn it. Be patient. Time is on your side! &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
