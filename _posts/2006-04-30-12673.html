<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237019441">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;he used to be an awesome speller&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I want to assure you that kids will naturally pick things up as they <br/>
find a need for it but the truth of the matter is that some people <br/>
are just not good spellers.  My husband can&#39;t spell worth beans but <br/>
spell check works great for him and he makes a darn good living for <br/>
us and has an extremely high IQ so I don&#39;t think it has effected his <br/>
life in a negative way at all.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that I was really concerned about was my sons <br/>
grammar and it was the one thing that I would wake up in the middle <br/>
of the night worrying about, even though I never mentioned or pushed <br/>
it at all.  He is now 13 and has wonderful spelling, punctuation, <br/>
and grammar!!  He didn&#39;t learn it from me because I never gave him a <br/>
formal lesson but he picked it up from somewhere, namely unlimited <br/>
computer use and lots of reading.   <br/>
<br/>
How old is your son?  Sometimes these fears arise out of fear of <br/>
what people will think of us if our kids are not &quot;up to grade <br/>
level&quot;.  He isn&#39;t in school so you need not worry if he is learning <br/>
at a different pace than someone else and you certainly don&#39;t need <br/>
to worry about spelling in a world with spell check.<br/>
<br/>
My other son will be 11 this summer and is just beginning to read on <br/>
his own.  I never worried because my sister&#39;s son was 11 or 12 <br/>
before he learned how to read and you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell if he <br/>
learned to read at 6 or just recently.  Every child is unique and <br/>
the more you let go the more you will see learning happening all on <br/>
its own.  Take ten deep breaths................................<br/>
