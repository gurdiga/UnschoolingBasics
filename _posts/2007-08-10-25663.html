As far as *I* am concerned, there are no other crabs, only poor imitations  <br/>
of the One True Crab ;) For my 30th Bday we had 2 bushels flown in, and again  <br/>
for my 31st, lol!!! My family puts Old Bay in EVERYTHING possible, lol...good <br/>
in  a Bloody Mary, I might add! <br/>
 <br/>
Silverqueen, REAL tomatoes, a chocolate snoball and some frozen custard and  <br/>
a some Ledo&#39;s pizza from the original in Adelphi. YES, Ma&#39;am! lol! :) <br/>
 <br/>
My dad&#39;s family owned a nursery on Bel Air road (and the old stone house is  <br/>
still there, on the corner, sorta), both parents went to Parkville High, my  <br/>
mother lived on Putty Hill...my grandparents are in Olney now, and I miss them  <br/>
so much. <br/>
 <br/>
Glad to meet another lover of the One True Crab ;)<br/>

I may be Ca born, but my innards are pure &quot;Balmer.&quot; ;) <br/>

I just wanted to chime in now since I grew up in Adelphi, ate at least 2x&#39;s a month at the original ledos AND had a crab feast just a few weeks ago! Our crab feast is an annual thing here (we&#39;re in WV now) and all our transplanted MD friends get SO excited!!<br/>
Amy (and others in the area) you are welcome to come next year!!<br/>
