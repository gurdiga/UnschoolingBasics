- Just thought I would pass it along.<br/>

Glenna Whitley discusses her Children&#39;s educational choices:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    When the twins were born, Linda assumed she would resume her<br/>
career in marketing to afford the best education money could buy. In<br/>
Denver, when the boys were 3, she finagled them into a<br/>
pre-kindergarten that fed into an exclusive private school.<br/>
<br/>
    On the first day, Austin went in with an astronomy book. But when<br/>
he asked the teacher when they were going to study astronomy, she<br/>
looked puzzled and said, &quot;I think you study that in college.&quot; Linda<br/>
says Austin grabbed his brother by the hand and told the teacher,<br/>
&quot;Thank you very much, but we&#39;re going home to study astronomy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
    ...<br/>
<br/>
    When the boys were 6, she read them a book on the cave art of<br/>
Lascaux. &quot;They loved it,&quot; Linda says. It started the boys&#39; fascination<br/>
with history. &quot;We went from there to the Hittites and the Sumerians<br/>
and the Macedonians.&quot; From ancient history they got into military<br/>
history, their current obsession.<br/>
<br/>
    ...<br/>
<br/>
    A few years ago, the boys took a reading test. &quot;They wanted to<br/>
know where they were,&quot; Linda says. &quot;They look at their friends in<br/>
school and wonder internally whether they measure up.&quot; Graded by mail,<br/>
the test showed they were reading at the level of college sophomores.<br/>
<br/>
    Linda and Dan feel their job as unschoolers is that of guides.<br/>
What are the boys missing out on? Can they use a board game or outing<br/>
to feed into one of their interests? She took them to a book signing<br/>
where they got to talk to Mario Livio, author of The Golden Ratio,<br/>
about Fibonacci numbers. They do math by shopping for groceries or<br/>
figuring out the area of a room. They play Elemento, a board game<br/>
based on the periodic table.<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;My job is to put things in their path in a way that can be<br/>
engaging,&quot; Linda says. &quot;You have to be ahead and think of<br/>
opportunities for them. We do read the &#39;great books,&#39; but if they<br/>
aren&#39;t interested in one, I&#39;ll go get the tape and we&#39;ll listen in the<br/>
car.&quot; Also in the car: tapes from The Teaching Company on great<br/>
battles of the ancient world, the theory of evolution and comparative<br/>
religion. Right now they are listening to From Yao to Mao: 5,000 Years<br/>
of Chinese History.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a wonderful description of how to approach unschooling<br/>
in general. Way to go Glenna!<br/>
