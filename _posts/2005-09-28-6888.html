<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654130584">Hello,<br/>
I have a question. My family lives in Tillamook County Oregon and my <br/>
dd is 8 and my ds is 4. My niece is in ps and the sixth grade, she <br/>
wants me to chaperone one of her dances at the school. My children <br/>
have been invited by her too. I just don&#39;t know if that constitutes as <br/>
an extracurricular activity that the state can then make my dd take <br/>
yearly test or not. The dance isn&#39;t worth it to me, but the kids <br/>
really want to go. I love my niece and want to be included in her <br/>
activities. My niece is going to talk to her principal, I&#39;m not sure <br/>
that is who to talk to about this. Help, I know alot of you are really <br/>
busy,but HELP!!<br/>
