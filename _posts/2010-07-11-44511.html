<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117280620">My kids are 14, 12 and 6 and the 6 yr old is mentally about 3-ish but<br/>
thankfully she is content to play a lot by herself.  (Something she learned<br/>
in the orphanage I guess) and I am about to FINALLY get my Bachelors and<br/>
then on to Master&#39;s.  I&#39;ve been taking classes on-line with Troy.  It&#39;s not<br/>
Harvard, but it gets me the paper I need and I can do it on my schedule.  So<br/>
it&#39;s very easy to fit it in around the kids.  The only time I&#39;m &quot;tied&quot; down<br/>
to my desk is when I&#39;m taking a test.  During that time I ask the boys to<br/>
watch Morgan (actually just help her, she is usually in the room with me)<br/>
and get her something to drink or a snack etc if she needs it.  I can<br/>
usually yell for them to come if I need them.  But it&#39;s pretty easy to<br/>
juggle this.  The Master&#39;s will be harder because it can&#39;t be done on-line.<br/>
So I&#39;ll be looking to do weekends and evenings when my husband is home.<br/>
<br/>
It can be done.  You just have to look for ways to get there.  It&#39;s a lot<br/>
like unschooling really.  We tend to think there are only two options for<br/>
anything...behave or misbehave...give or take...this or that....now or<br/>
later...etc....but generally if you look there are more than two options and<br/>
if YOU are willing to be flexible you can get it done.  I do a lot of my<br/>
writing at night when Morgan is in bed and the boys are busily killing<br/>
things on their XBoxes which is what they want to be doing.  With older kids<br/>
it&#39;s easier obviously because they don&#39;t need you to be hovering over their<br/>
shoulder ever minute.  It&#39;s the young ones that need more and perhaps you<br/>
have to think about waiting until your 3 yr old is older before starting.<br/>
But really with on-line classes, you really can do them at 2 am if you need<br/>
to.  It&#39;s been pretty easy to do this for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351853512">I&#39;m working part-time from home (10-12 hours a week), have an 8, 6, 3, 18 months, and due w/number 5 in Sept/Oct. I will be going back to <br/>
get my Master&#39;s degree, but doing it online. My local college (Michigan State University) has an online MAT, and Central Michigan has an online master&#39;s in child development. Not sure which direction I&#39;m going just yet. Anyway, I&#39;ll be starting this month if possible. If not, I&#39;m going to give myself a month after baby before beginning. <br/>
<br/>
After my second was born I starting my own online business, and I worked between 70 and 90 hours a week (full time day job). I worked like this until last Dec when I sold the business. Honestly, I find myself a little bored to not be so busy all the time. So, I figured why not. Plus, my family could REALLY use the fellowship and loan income right now, and the future income I can bring in with a MA degree.<br/>
<br/>
My husband works 3 am to noon, 5 days a week, and is also back in online school. So, we&#39;re an incredibly busy house.<br/>
<br/>
So, I do most of the things I need to in the evenings after the kids go to bed. I know some are radical, but we are not, and all kids are in bed by 8:30. Even with a newborn, while it&#39;s harder, w/a laptop on the couch, baby nursing or sleeping, it&#39;s not THAT bad. I think it&#39;s harder when they&#39;re 9 months to maybe 2 yrs. But again, it all gets easier with older kids to help, and to get the little guys engaged in something. I love to have the big kids watch something interesting on tv, for instance, then teach the little guys about it in smaller guy language. Or my 8 yr old is finally starting to really get better at reading, so he can get the little ones going on a project, cooking, etc. I can also get things done while the kids are &quot;doing chores&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It all works out. We don&#39;t go as many places, but we already haven&#39;t been because it&#39;s IMPOSSIBLE for me to go outside in the 90 degree heat when I&#39;m this big, so it&#39;s really not that different. And in the winter we go to the kids science museum, but that&#39;s about it. Bummer is I won&#39;t be able to leave the baby long enough to take the big kids to the ballet this year at Xmas. That&#39;s our yearly outing when the babies get big enough.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, go for it. It&#39;s great when the kids see you aren&#39;t too good to keep learning as an adult, too. :)<br/>
