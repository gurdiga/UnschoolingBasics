<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992916218">Hi!  I&#39;m new to the list.  I have been learning about unschooling for <br/>
the past several months and I love it philosophically.  For the most <br/>
part I love it for homeschooling my eight year old.  I still <br/>
occassionally wrestle with doubts, but I&#39;m hoping this list will help <br/>
with that :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to chatting with you all as I explore the unschooling <br/>
philosophy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490279500">Hi, Lanie!  It&#39;s completely normal to wrestle with doubts.  This is a <br/>
great place to discuss them and learn.  I&#39;m sure you will find this <br/>
group a wonderful resource.  Welcome!<br/>
