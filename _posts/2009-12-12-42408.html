<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020663293">if there are any articles on why &#39;unschooling&#39; was chosen as the term for unschooling, I&#39;d love to read them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking a bit about it and wondering about its origins.  At first glance, it sounds like such a reactionary name for what we do.  I mean, we are not &#39;not-schoolers,&#39;.  Or maybe unschoolers are &#39;not-schoolers&#39; but it seems like radical unschoolers are not really &#39;not-schoolers&#39; because RU life doesn&#39;t feel like its about &#39;school&#39; or &#39;education&#39; at all!  My friend in Britain called what she does with her kids Autonomous Education, and that sounds less reactionary.  I think I&#39;ve heard taht &quot;Consensual Living&quot; is basically the same as RU.  Is that true?  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m wondering about where all the terminology comes from, and how things are called in different places, and how these terms might affect the way groups view themselves, etc.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-365087611">We are &quot;not schoolers&quot; - unschoolers take the school agenda out of<br/>
living. The terminology, I believe, comes from John Holt originally.<br/>
There&#39;s school, school at home (more or less structured but still using<br/>
the same paradigm) and not school, not using that paradigm. It&#39;s also<br/>
sometimes called life learning, whole life learning, autodidactism,<br/>
autonomous education, free range learning, and a whole host of others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The definitions I&#39;m finding specifically say &quot;teaching&quot; adults, as opposed to learning or even &quot;education&quot;. That&#39;s a pretty significant distinction, one that makes it questionable for use in an unschooling context. <br/>

<br/>
At the same time, its valuable, in terms of understanding unschooling, to think about the ways adults go about learning things. Not because adults brains necessarily work the same way as kid brains (although there&#39;s a whole &#39;nother topic in there) but because its a much closer model to the way unschooling kids learn than the way kids in school learn. Compulsory &quot;education&quot; produces a very different learning process than natural learning - a difference that&#39;s more profound than those differences between the way a 5yos mind processes new information vs a 40yos mind, because of the effects of motivation. <br/>
