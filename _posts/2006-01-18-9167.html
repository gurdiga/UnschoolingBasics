Don&#39;t you just hate the word &quot;used &quot; here???  Way too  schooly.  Sounds like <br/>
there is a motive to the thing.  :)<br/>

How about &quot;how they enjoyed the activity&quot; or even &quot;how they did the  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-864245097">how about I brought it up with my kids, and they were not the  <br/>
slightest bit interested? and that&#39;s okay!<br/>
<br/>
LOL!<br/>
I saved the URL just in case sometime down the road they are  <br/>
interested. I thought it was cool, but I think they were still tired  <br/>
from MLKJr Day. There was a whole slew of stuff around the city  <br/>
Sunday and Monday and we went to the zoo as well as parade, a  <br/>
different church (a suggestion on a schooly site) and some stuff in  <br/>
the library downtown (which we&#39;d never been to).<br/>

Did you know?... <br/>
--most well-known brands of lipstick contain lead? <br/>
--air fresheners have toxic ingredients you aren&#39;t supposed to breathe? <br/>
--most household cleaners have carcinogens and neurotoxins such as<br/>
formaldehyde, phenols and/or phosphates? <br/>
--of 2,983 everyday products, 884 have toxic chemicals? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad we switched! <br/>
We are now safer and healthier, using toxic-free products and saving money,<br/>
too. Call (212) 990-6214 for a 10 minute prerecorded presentation or contact<br/>
me directly.<br/>
