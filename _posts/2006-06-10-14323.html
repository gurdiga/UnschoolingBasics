There is no noticeable difference other than the kids have more kids around to play with.  We just simply live our lives.<br/>

Several years ago. my nephews envied my boys during the school year <br/>
&#39;cause they thought Cam & Dunc did nothing all year. But they pitied <br/>
them in the summer &#39;cause I told them that we don&#39;t take the summer off.<br/>
<br/>
Then one of them came and stayed for a week one summer.<br/>

Unschooling is about living as if school didn&#39;t exist. So, what would <br/>
*you* do if school didn&#39;t exist?<br/>

One mom, when discussing what to call her homeschool, tossed around <br/>
&quot;Our Lady of Perpetual Vacation&quot; ( I wish I could remember who said <br/>
that! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>

Since we don&#39;t &quot;start&quot; school, we don&#39;t &quot;stop&quot; school either! Learning <br/>
happens.<br/>

<br/>
**You can&#39;t stop it and it never ends!!!  It&#39;s like asking how do you <br/>
stop &quot;life&quot; for the summer?  You can&#39;t and why would you want to?  We <br/>
take vacations from things/activities that we are forced to do or that <br/>
don&#39;t come naturally or honor our natural rhythyms.  What if you lived <br/>
your whole life like you were on vacation?  What if everything you did, <br/>
you did because you chose to do it, wholeheartedly and with joy?  When <br/>
would you need a break of the schoolish kind?  Never!  Sure, there would <br/>
be periods of rest and periods of activity but it isn&#39;t the same as <br/>
saying &quot;I&#39;m on summer vacation (can do what I want) until September when <br/>
I have to resume doing things I dislike&quot;.  Its more like, &quot;I&#39;m tired <br/>
right now and I need to rest but as soon as my energy level is back up, <br/>
I&#39;ll be back at it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents for whatever it is worth!  I am having a particularly <br/>
lazy day today BTW!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-604599711">how do<br/>

<br/>
There is no school to stop!<br/>
Our summers are far busier than the winters, we try to get out every day if only to run to the little store for a soda. Most of our days are spent traveling, swimming at the lake, playing with friends, going to the many local events (Apple Blossom Festival, Mountain Heritage Craft fair, Flea markets, Farm Day, etc.) being outside, camps (I think Emily is going to FOUR this summer!) Camping, hanging out on the banks of the Shenendoah, we may go on a Tubing trip this year, reading, watching movies, Strolling around Shepherdstown, WV, and loads of other stuff.  I love to get out and about and winter time makes for much more nesting in our home although it is not very different than any other time of the year.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By never starting school in the first place. :o) Our summers run the same as any other time of year. Our activities are governed by weather, availability of friends and resources, time, money and interest. So our day to day activities may look different in the summer but the unschooling is still the same. I support their interests, strew their path with new and interesting  things and know that they are learning.<br/>

I was thinking about this the other day, when Kelly was talking about the  <br/>
church of unschool.<br/>
 <br/>
I remember it as someone from Alabama needing a church-sounding homeschool  <br/>
name for the state and Sandra coming up with Our Lady.<br/>
 <br/>
I could be wrong.....been wrong before.  Either way, it&#39;s funny.   I don&#39;t <br/>
care who ya are, that&#39;s funny right there!  (we saw Cars....doing a  little <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343869942">Hi Barbara,<br/>
<br/>
A belated welcome to the list.  I&#39;ve been crazy busy this past week <br/>
with VBS at church and just haven&#39;t been online much which has felt <br/>
very strange for me!  :)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t DO summer anymore than we DO any other traditional school <br/>
break.  Life doesn&#39;t stop during the summer.  We live and learn <br/>
every day of every year during our entire lifetime.  The whole point <br/>
of unschooling is to learn to step away from the nonsensical method <br/>
of viewing learning as being able to happen only in certain places <br/>
(i.e. classrooms, labs, etc.) or at certain times (from Sept to May, <br/>
Monday through Friday, 8am to 3pm).  <br/>
<br/>
The one thing I see most newbies to unschooling misunderstand is <br/>
that life and learning happen without us pointing it out to one <br/>
another, whether to our spouses, friends, children, or whoever.  New <br/>
unschoolers expect their children to choose to do schoolish things <br/>
like work through a Math textbook, study a certain time period in <br/>
History perhaps through reading regular books, set up a Science <br/>
experiment, etc.  It truly helps to focus YOUR thinking away from <br/>
schoolish things.  All the things we do in life can be categorized <br/>
in some manner if you speak educationlese, but one wonders WHY you <br/>
need to do that?  For example, when you prepare your grocery list <br/>
and complete your shopping, do you award yourself a grade or some <br/>
other form of external reward for doing something in Home <br/>
Economics?  Do you consider your Math lessons done for the day when <br/>
you balance your checkbook?  Adults do not, normally, separate <br/>
everything into subjects but we sure expect that of our children.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started unschooling, I had to genuinely believe that it <br/>
was OKAY that my children may never, never do anything that looks <br/>
like schoolwork.  Over time, I&#39;ve become so excited by that fact <br/>
that I now take a double-look when I do see them choosing something <br/>
that looks like schoolwork!  *lol*  <br/>
<br/>
I may repeat this alot and it&#39;s also for my sake, but I think <br/>
the &#39;unschooling&#39; term is more for us parents trying to let go.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think of my kids as unschooling because they aren&#39;t trying to <br/>
undo anything.  Instead, they are living life... actually WE are <br/>
living together and that encompasses so very much if you truly stop <br/>
and marvel at it.<br/>

Florida LOL!)  Depending on your neighborhood or your children&#39;s<br/>
relationships with schooled children, there might be more kids at your<br/>
house in the summer than the winter on more days than in the summer<br/>
than the winter.  If you &quot;stop unschooling&quot; for the summer then it<br/>
would mean you would be schooling during the summer.<br/>
