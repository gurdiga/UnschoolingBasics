<div id="ygrps-yiv-206062690">I haven&#39;t heard of this book so I plan to track it down to read.  <br/>
But something I have run up against is the idea that this is the <br/>
EXCEPTION--only one unschooler.  Also it seems to buy into the idea <br/>
that Harvard = success, which isn&#39;t necessarily true.  So I&#39;m always <br/>
looking for what &quot;adult&quot; unschoolers are doing in &quot;real life&quot; to <br/>
offer up to those who question me about it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924228216">Valerie Fitzenreiter wrote &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot;. Her daughter,<br/>
Laurie Chancey is not at Harvard, but chose college after 18 years of<br/>
full-on radical unschooling and won all sorts of awards. After<br/>
obtaining her bachelors, she chose to take a break from school but<br/>
went back and is now pursuing her masters degree.<br/>
Laurie is a strong, vibrant young woman that I have NO doubt will be<br/>
successful in whatever she chooses.<br/>
<br/>
Her website is here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chancey.info/">http://www.chancey.info/</a><br/>
<br/>
Peter Kowalke is another grown unschooler, pursuing his dreams. He&#39;s<br/>
married to an unschooler, Mae.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.peterkowalke.com/">http://www.peterkowalke.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I have heard that his documentary was not a fabulous movie by RU<br/>
standards, but if you hand in there, Cameron Lovejoy&#39;s movie should be<br/>
out before too long!! I hope.<br/>
The Lovejoys will be visiting next week so I&#39;ll find out the status of<br/>
his unschooling documentary that was started last year. I&#39;m sure it<br/>
will be interesting, varied and rich...like Cameron himself. Speaking<br/>
of Cameron, he&#39;s a grown unschooler that works full time. He&#39;s also<br/>
very involved in drumming with several groups, running a camp and<br/>
basically living a very full life following his unique passions.<br/>
<br/>
My own children don&#39;t need to make a living, yet are constantly<br/>
thinking up interesting ways to make money! Trevor (16) plans to get<br/>
his computer repair business up and running this year. He&#39;s quite<br/>
knowledgable about technology in general and has been invited to hang<br/>
out with the tech department up at ETSU (by a professor that works up<br/>
there).<br/>
<br/>
Both the older Dodd kids have jobs and are doing well, one of them<br/>
started working when he was fairly young. Started as volunteer work<br/>
and then turned into a paying job because he was SO responsible and<br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in the grown unschooler &quot;exception&quot;. Most of the time,<br/>
when I&#39;ve read of angry or frustrated adult unschoolers (I&#39;ve heard of<br/>
two) I look at the life of the family and see that the parents weren&#39;t<br/>
truly addressing the child&#39;s desires.<br/>
One family I&#39;m thinking of, lived very rural and never brought this<br/>
child into the city where he wanted to be. He wanted a larger social<br/>
group and the outlets a city could offer, but didn&#39;t have access to<br/>
that. True unschooling is a partnership in which everyone&#39;s needs are<br/>
met most of the time. If a child needs more access to something, it&#39;s<br/>
our job to help them get it! Ignoring a very real need for years, is<br/>
likely to cause resentment and perhaps the child would be better off<br/>
in school if they wanted to be there. I may be wrong, but I think this<br/>
child wanted to go to school and they didn&#39;t let him.<br/>

school, but *barely* passed.  He had issues with doing busy work, homework<br/>
and anything else that &quot;reinforced&quot; a theory that he already understood.<br/>
(He&#39;d pass the tests with flying colors - usually 100% but he would fail<br/>
because he lacked to do his &quot;assignments&quot;)  He knew he wanted to do<br/>
something with computers.  He went into the military for 6 years and when he<br/>
got out he started his own venturing into &quot;uncollege.&quot;  He now works as a<br/>
Network Engineer, Administrator and Computer Programmer (his technical job<br/>
is System Network Administrator).  I have a very good friend in BC who<br/>
unschooled her three daughters.  I think wrote about this last week.  One is<br/>
a professional photographer specializing in weddings and baby photos but<br/>
also does photos for magazines.  Another is a published author and SAHM.<br/>
The third is leaving this week to begin working at Disney World in<br/>
attractions (she has been told she will be singing and dancing in one of the<br/>
shows.)<br/>
<br/>
Some kids decide to go on to college and make it their goal to have the<br/>
requirements needed to enter college while others start off on careers that<br/>
are built around an interest and skip college altogether.  I have a budding<br/>
author in my house but she hasn&#39;t decided whether or not she is going to go<br/>
to college or just keep writing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754417269">Well, my daughter isn&#39;t an adult yet chronologically but she has supported herself for the last three years.  At the age of 15, she works part-time at a local gymnastics school teaching classes.  She raises dairy goats and sells them and their milk.  She also raises other livestock, competing against professional breeders, and auctions her animals.  She completely pays for all of her expenses other than food, and she could afford that but it simply isn&#39;t necessary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484056715">Then there are the adult schoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I was in the top 5% of my class, and I was told I had to do even  <br/>
better, to aim for the top 1%. My life was miserable because the only  <br/>
focus I was taught was to achieve, to get good grades. I have no self  <br/>
esteem because I was bullied by adults my entire life to &#39;live up to  <br/>
my potential&#39;. I wasted over $50,000 in student loans going to  <br/>
college when really all i wanted was to be left alone. I love being a  <br/>
stay at home mom, the adults from my high school and my family  <br/>
thought I was a dismal failure. That&#39;s not the system i want my kids  <br/>
in...my dad and my aunt now, have always been proud of me, but I  <br/>
never saw that for all the failure I saw in other&#39;s eyes.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, my brother was considered the bottom percentage. He grew up  <br/>
being compared, unfortunately to me. He had the guts to quit, to  <br/>
&#39;fail&#39;, to stop trying to live up to others expectations. He&#39;s a  <br/>
brilliant guy. He figured out electronics by himself, he&#39;s a genius  <br/>
with computers, and understands them intuitively. He&#39;s got the same  <br/>
issues I have, no self-esteem, much self-loathing.<br/>
<br/>
I think the question is odd, what JOBS do these people have. Why not  <br/>
ask how happy they are? All in all, I&#39;d rather live happily in a  <br/>
crummy apartment and work in pizza (one of my favorite jobs, I might  <br/>
add, in college) than be wealthy and miserable (as premed, I worked  <br/>
at a hospital, it sucked and NO ONE was happy). We&#39;re both happy now,  <br/>
after 30 years of life, because we finally had the nerve to buck the  <br/>
system. He&#39;s married a homeschooler, and they plan on unschooling. I  <br/>
finally got the chutzpah to pull my own kids out of school. Basically  <br/>
told my husband that if I&#39;m the one staying home and responsible for  <br/>
the kids, we&#39;ll do it my way. It didn&#39;t take long for him to see how  <br/>
much happier they are, and how much more eager they are to be part of  <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
My husband finally has the job of his dreams, it has nothing to do  <br/>
with his college degree, he got a govt job, they trained him in  <br/>
something completely different. He&#39;s finally worked his way to what  <br/>
he wanted to do, play with computers all day ;-) Who said gaming was  <br/>
bad?<br/>

&gt; of gifted kids don&#39;t exactly get stellar grades, I&#39;ve discovered.<br/>
&gt; Some of them get decided lousy ones in school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly!!!  Einstein dropped out of school (of which the school teachers<br/>
were most grateful) and flunked out of college in everything except<br/>
mathematics and science.  He had no use whatsoever for anything except math<br/>
and science.  His whole world revolved around numbers and atoms.  And look<br/>
what a miserable failure he was!  :-)  Edison was similar.  He hated<br/>
school.  Franklin was another that &quot;mastered&quot; many subjects only because he<br/>
was forced to (a really interesting read is his autobiography!)   Bill Gates<br/>
had miserable grades.  He may have been able to make something for himself<br/>
if he would have had an interest outside computers.<br/>
<br/>
Those are all &quot;famous&quot; examples of people who had single interests that led<br/>
them to have fairly &quot;successful&quot; lives.  But I look at my co-parent and how<br/>
he is SO happy doing what he is doing (most of the time when we don&#39;t have a<br/>
hurricane threatening the US - although secretly I think he enjoys that part<br/>
of his job as well - just not the aftermath.)  Last night we were talking<br/>
about our passions.  Those things that we love to do.  The kids asked him<br/>
what his passion was.  What did he want to do that would make him so happy.<br/>
His response was to make computers talk to each other to complete jobs and<br/>
understand chages.  Then he stopped and said, &quot;Hmmm.  I&#39;m doing that.&quot;  He<br/>
is an example of someone who is not famous but that I would put in the<br/>
&quot;successful&quot; pile.  My brother is another one that I would label<br/>
&quot;successful&quot; because he is doing something that he loves and followed his<br/>
own heart to get there.  He may be poor as dirt, but he is so happy in his<br/>
life.  The only thing that would make it perfect for him is if he had<br/>
custody of his daughter and a life partner and more children.  (He&#39;s working<br/>
on that part LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
I find it interesting that when most parents are asked what they want for<br/>
their children they first say, &quot;I want them successful and happy.&quot;  But they<br/>
look at success as being monetarily wealthy.  But I notice that so many<br/>
people put success before happiness.  They do this in their own lives as<br/>
well.  One of my best friends once toasted me saying, &quot;I hope that you learn<br/>
to work to live not live to work.&quot;  He&#39;s the happiest little grown up boy.<br/>
He manages a concrete business in Oregon where he gets to &quot;play in the mud&quot;<br/>
all day and drive big trucks.  Financially he and his wife &quot;eek&quot; out a<br/>
living, but they are SO happy with their lives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good points -- my hopes for my son is for him to be a successful <br/>
human -- and I mean that he will be a good person, happy, contribute <br/>
to the world in a positive way, and yes, be able to make a living, <br/>
but hopefully doing what he enjoys.  I know my dh enjoys his job, and <br/>
we moved to where we are at a fairly large cut in pay, to do the same <br/>
work, for what we consider a better quality of life.   <br/>
<br/>
If my son were to do illegal things such as drug dealing (and I don&#39;t <br/>
for a minute think he would), then I would feel I didn&#39;t raise him to <br/>
be a successful human, no matter how much money he made.  I suspect <br/>
most (not all -- I&#39;ve heard of proud parents of drug dealers) parents <br/>
wouldn&#39;t feel that their child was successful even if they made <br/>
oodles of dough through illicit means.  At least, I hope they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>****I SO agree with this! Not every successful person had to go to college to <br/>
get there. I went, my dh went, but it was WAY after high school when we did <br/>
finally go and I never finished. We both hated school so much and after being <br/>
forced and bullied into so called learning, we rebelled against it for many <br/>
years. It&#39;s no wonder we have found unschooling for our kids! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If our girls (now 11 & 12) want to go to college then, so be it, but, they <br/>
may not want to, they may want to start their own business or pursue their <br/>
dreams in another way. Having a college degree does not guarantee success. I think <br/>
if there is a desire and a strong will, pretty much anyone can obtain one any <br/>
way.<br/>
