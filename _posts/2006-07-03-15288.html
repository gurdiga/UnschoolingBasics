<div id="ygrps-yiv-710940641">***I wouldn&#39;t mind hearing more about how people keep their cool when <br/>
under tremendous stress, over time, though - that would be helpful! ***<br/>
<br/>
I deal with stress a few different ways, kinda depends on my level. <br/>
   <br/>
  Sometimes I light a candle, say a blessing, and breath deep and try to contect with myself. <br/>
   <br/>
  Sometimes I play music really loud and dance around the house,  jumping on the furniture, this usually ends up with me and the kids having a contest to see who can come up with the coolest moves, they have the BEST moves :). <br/>
   <br/>
  Other times the only thing that will work is baking. Bread is good, you can&#39;t rush it, kneeding and feeling the dough transform is wonderfully theraputic. Working chocolate is good too, it&#39;s soothing to melt and swirl and it smells sooooo good.<br/>
   <br/>
  Screaming/yelling has worked. We&#39;ll have yelling contests, the boys started this when they need to release and I&#39;ve found that it can work wonders.<br/>
   <br/>
  Watching moves that make me cry. Sometimes when things are overwhelming and I&#39;ve had to hold it together and I just can&#39;t anymore I put on a movie that I KNOW will make me cry and I have at it.<br/>
   <br/>
  Hope some of this helped...<br/>

Any transition serious enough to alter your definition of self will require not just small adjustments in your way of living and thinking but a full-on metamorphosis   ~Martha Beck~<br/>
