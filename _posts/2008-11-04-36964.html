<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780966637">I know we&#39;ve been talking a lot about getting our homes in order and <br/>
chores.  Here is a link to the Holidays Control Journal from Flylady.  <br/>
Basically it is a 25 page document helping you to get ready for the <br/>
holidays.  It will guide you in all areas--cleaning your home, buying <br/>
gifts, decorating for the holidays, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-135743364">Oh, I love the Holiday Control Journal!!  I never got into the habit<br/>
of using her regular Control Journal (although I *do* have what I call<br/>
my Great Big Book of Everything and the whole family knows that&#39;s<br/>
where all the really important things are), but I have been using the<br/>
Holiday one for several years now.  It really helps me keep track of<br/>
things, like when I buy presents a few months early.  December rolls<br/>
around and I have no idea what I did in September.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I put my HCJ in a red folder/binder thingy and decorated it with fancy<br/>
Christmas stickers.  :-)<br/>

Thank you for passing it along to the group!<br/>
