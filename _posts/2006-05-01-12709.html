<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070311189">It was mentioned that maybe bedtimes were invented for school.  I <br/>
think a lot of things in our society were invented because of <br/>
school!  lol <br/>
<br/>
Ren asked me to post this a while back but I haven&#39;t had a lot of <br/>
time to get on lists until this last couple days but in regards to <br/>
the above comment I thought it would fit in pretty good<br/>
<br/>
An interesting excerpt from a book that Martin is reading called <br/>
Before You Quit Your Job, 10 Real Life <br/>
Lessons Every Entrepreneur Should Know About Building a Multimillion <br/>
Dollar Business:<br/>
<br/>
Are Some People Born Entrepreneurs?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Are people born entrepreneurs or are they trained to be <br/>
entrepreneurs?&quot;  When I asked my rich dad his <br/>
opinion on this age-old question, he said, &quot;Asking if people are <br/>
born or trained to be entrepreneurs is a <br/>
question that makes no sense.  It would be like asking if people are <br/>
born employees or trained to become <br/>
employees?&quot;  he went on to say,  &quot;People are trainable.  They can be <br/>
trained to be either employees or <br/>
entrepreneurs.  The reason there are more employees than <br/>
entrepreneurs is simply that our schools train young <br/>
people to become employees.  That is why so many parents say to <br/>
there child, &#39;Go to school so you can get a <br/>
good job.&#39;  I have yet to hear any parent say, &#39;Go to school to <br/>
become an entrepreneur.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Employees Are a New Phenomenon<br/>
<br/>
The employee is a rather new phenomenon.  During the agrarian age, <br/>
most people were entrepreneurs.  Many <br/>
were farmers who worked the king&#39;s lands.  They did not receive a <br/>
paycheck from the king.  In fact, it was the <br/>
other way around.  The farmer paid the king a tax for the right to <br/>
use the land.  Those who were not farmers <br/>
were tradespeople, aka small business entrepreneurs.  They were <br/>
butchers, bakers, and candlestick makers.  <br/>
Their last names often reflected their business.  That is why today <br/>
many people are named Smith, for the <br/>
village blacksmith; Baker, for bakery owners; and Farmer, because <br/>
their family&#39;s business was farming.  They <br/>
were entrepreneurs, not employees.  Most children who were raised in <br/>
entrepreneurial families followed in <br/>
their parents&#39; footsteps, also becoming entrepreneurs.  Again, it is <br/>
just a matter of training.<br/>
<br/>
It was during the Industrial Age that the demand for employees <br/>
grew.  In response, the government took over <br/>
the task of mass education and adopted the Prussian system, upon <br/>
which most Western school systems in the <br/>
world are today modeled.  When you research the philosophy behind <br/>
Prussian education, you will find that the <br/>
stated purpose was to produce soldiers and employees......people who <br/>
would follow orders and do as they were <br/>
told.  The Prussian system of education is a great system for mass-<br/>
producing employees.  It is a matter of <br/>
training.</div>
