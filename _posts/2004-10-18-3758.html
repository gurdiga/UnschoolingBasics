<div id="ygrps-yiv-407513965"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I googled &quot;asthma inner city&quot; and found a bunch of articles like this <br/>
&gt; one: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://allergies.about.com/b/a/111820.htm">http://allergies.about.com/b/a/111820.htm</a> talking about how it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; the allergens in the house that cause the problem.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our homes are becoming our illness.  Most of our newer homes (built from the 1980&#39;s til now) are so air tight that they don&#39;t breathe.  We recycle the same air over and over.  This is why mold is becoming such an issue.  Since houses don&#39;t breathe, water gets caught in the house and creates a problem.  Our houses are more energy efficient, but they are making us ill.  This is primarily why I looked for an older house when we were house hunting.  I wanted something that wasn&#39;t shrunk wrapped.  My allergies and asthma has greatly improved since moving here and my son has only had one asthmatic episode.  <br/>
<br/>
We lived in a spanking brand new house when we lived in Oregon and I was sick all the time.  I never associated it with my house until just a few years ago.<br/>

I&#39;ve read that before.  Not sure how much truth there is to it, but it makes<br/>
sense.  We live in a newer house but I always make sure to open windows<br/>
regularly so we have fresh air all the time.  Except for on the coldest<br/>
nights, we sleep with the windows opened at least a crack.  We seem to stay<br/>
pretty healthy compared to many people.  I think part of that is getting<br/>
regular exercise and fresh air, but another part of that is that we have<br/>
much less contact with people than the average person by not being in school<br/>
all day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800041419">Any suggestions on alternative ways to treat asthma? My 7 y/o son has asthma since age 2.5. We treat him with Xopenex and Pulmicort through a nebulizer every day. He doesn&#39;t like to take it and I don&#39;t like having to give it to him. He had one hospitalization when he was 3 or 4. The asthma seems to worsen if we cut back on the treatments. Perhaps this is how it has to be for now, but I just wanted to see if others had any suggestions.<br/>
One other thing. We had a cat for 16 years and she died last spring. She was not a problem for my son or husband, who also has asthma. Most cats do seem to be a trigger for both of them, but she was not. I have had cats all my life and would have a hard time living without one. We tried 3 times to get another cat or kitten after our beloved cat died. They all seemed to cause problems for son and hubby. Finally, in August, we got a kitten. She does seem to cause some problems for my son and hubby, but not severe. She is band from going into my son&#39;s room and our family bedroom. Any suggestions on keeping the cat and keeping my son healthy? Or, should we get rid of the cat? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924995894">I totally understand about the cat!!! And those sound like scary medicines that your son is on....I have asthma and i drink a cup of mullein tea in the morning...the herbalists say that mullein is like a clean sweep for the lungs....so i try to visualize that. I try to at least keep my cat out of the bedrooms......not always easy. I don&#39;t pet her, but if I do i wash hands right away....cause its hard to never pet her. Another friend of mine treats her daughters asthma with traditional chinese medicine and has been able to get her off all conventional medicines. She sees a doctor that specializes in this sort of thing and it really seems to work......if you have one that is close enough to visit. Hope this helps a bit....or a LOT!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026643341">Sharon I have had and worked with dogs all my life. If I had a child who&#39;s asthma gotten worse because of dogs I would not even think of having a dog.<br/>
That simple.<br/>
I have asthma and I know how bad it can be. Not only that but that I can sudendly have an attack and die ( unlikely, but possible).<br/>
 Can you voluntier at a cat shelter ?( you can have special clothles for that and change to get home)<br/>
Shelters not only need voluntiers to clean and feed but to play and socialize cats so they can be adoptable.<br/>
That way you spend some great time with cats doind something to help but you do not endanger your child and husband.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458060330">We recently added a kitten and after years w/ two cats and minimal allergy problems, the kitten has been a trigger for my daughter and husband.  <br/>
 <br/>
There is a theory that cats who a fed a healthy diet are less allergenic than those on regular cat food.  You might do some searches on holistic cat food or organic food.<br/>
 <br/>
I also have had very good luck w/ nettle tea.  I mix nettle w/ a flavor tea (we use the FairyTale blend at Mountain Rose Herbs) that my family likes and sweeten w/ honey.  www.mountainroseherbs.com is a good source.  Along w that, drinking plenty of water and taking extra vitamin C helps, too.<br/>
 <br/>
Keeping your cat well groomed and using air filters is good, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139464249">Zoe (newly 3) has asthma.  When we lived in NM she didn&#39;t.  When we moved to Oregon about a year and a half ago - it started.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s been hospitalized 2x and had several trips to the ER/Urgent Care.  She&#39;s on Flovent daily (was 2x day, but recently doubled to help her through the cold season).  We have a nebulizer at home for when she needs it.  We&#39;re very lucky because asthma doesn&#39;t affect her daily life.  It only flares up when she is sick. Her first hospitalization was before she was on any medication and directly after we had the floors steam cleaned. Her second hospitalization was after we had the vents in the house cleaned.  So we&#39;re living with slightly dirty floors and dusty vents :-)  Just in case.<br/>
<br/>
When we first started our asthma journey she hated taking her daily meds.  We worked with the doctor and got a daily steroid that could be used in the nebulizer.  We gave her the medication through a mask after she had gone to sleep.  That way, she got her medication, but it wasn&#39;t anything that caused annoyance or discomfort on her part.  I also offer her Flovent several times a day until she meets her daily dose. Her sister is awesome in keeping the mood light when Zoe needs to take her meds.  We&#39;ve &quot;given&quot; the meds to dolls and stuffed animals too. :-)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve acquired a pulse oximeter to measure how much oxygen she&#39;s getting.  It gives me a huge sense of security to know that, even if she sounds horrible (wheezing & coughing) that she&#39;s still getting plenty of oxygen. It also helps me determine when to bring her into the ER or doctor&#39;s office. We&#39;ve also worked out a plan with our doctor to use prednisone under certain circumstances without taking her to the ER first. The people at the ER have been wonderful, but it is still scary & disruptive & we like to avoid it if we can.<br/>
<br/>
It takes her longer to get over colds - a flare up can keep us close to<br/>
home for a month (1 week where she&#39;s getting sick. 1 week where she&#39;s<br/>
actually sick. 1 week for recovery. And 1 week because I&#39;m still<br/>
freaking out a little).<br/>
<br/>
We have a cat who is over ten years old.  We bought a rabbit shortly before we decided to move to Oregon (oh, about 45 minutes before the option became available, lol). We added a now 10 month old puppy about 5 months ago. Zoe doesn&#39;t have reactions to any of our animals. If she did, we&#39;d find new homes for them. When Auggie (our cat) passes on, we likely won&#39;t replace him (although I am a huge cat lover and would have 4!). If I&#39;d known we were moving, I wouldn&#39;t have added the rabbit (although he&#39;s an awesome pet!).<br/>
<br/>
Megan (8) is a big animal lover.  She started volunteering at a no-kill animal shelter almost a year ago.  We go weekly to socialize cats.  She is slightly reactive to cats (if she pets a cat, it is best if she doesn&#39;t rub her eyes), but Zoe is not. So we all get our cat/kitten fix every week.  Megan also has asthma, but it is extremely mild.  If either of the kids have a cold or cough, we skip the cat shelter than week as a precaution.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve looked into getting dust mite covers for the beds.  I&#39;ve read that magnesium, Zinc,Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and omega 3&#39;s can be helpful in alleviating asthma symptoms, but that is new information to me and I haven&#39;t had time to research it. I&#39;ve also wondered if adding foods that are supposed to have anti-inflammatory properties would help? Not in an &quot;eat this now&quot; kind of way.  More like making sure those types of foods are part of our regular options.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s asthma is much worse (and also non-existent in NM).  I don&#39;t clean or vacuum when he is home if I can avoid it. He&#39;s going to see an allergist next week to determine if there is anything that might be a trigger for him.  Zoe saw an allergist about a year ago and we know she is allergic to peanuts.  We&#39;ve opted not to do another test for awhile because it involves drawing blood and the allergist is satisfied with her previous skin prick test.<br/>
<br/>
Asthma is going to be a part of her life for now, but I don&#39;t want it to be any bigger than it needs to be.<br/>

<br/>
Singulair has been a life saver for us.  When my son (6) was around 2 or 3 he became ill and we spent a night with him coughing so much he caused himself to throw up.  We took him to the doctor and his doctor gave him a breathing treatment at his office.  He sent us home with a prescription for Singulair daily and also sent a nebulizer machine with Xopenex and Pulmicort for when he has flare ups.  He told us that more than likely our son would grow out of his problem.  The Asthmatic problem that is.  He will most likely always suffer from allergies that is if he stays in East Tennessee where we live because this area seems to be prone to have allergens especially in Spring and Fall.  Now thankfully, we have not had to use the nebulizer for sometime but we are still taking the Singulair which seems to manage his symptoms nicely.  We have two dogs in the house as well.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.  I know how scary it can be to see your child not being able to breathe properly.  I hope you find something that will work for your child soon and be able to keep your pet.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know how painful this decision is, but as a cat lover and asthma sufferer, I have to recommend finding a new home for the cat. Your son and dh are allergic to cats, and the limited effect of the current cat is likely to increase as their bodies&#39; resistance to the cat&#39;s dander increases. This was my experience with our rats: When we first got them, I could cuddle them all day long with no problem. After we&#39;d had them for a while, they made me wheeze just as much as cats do.<br/>
<br/>
Also--although I really hate being the big meanie who says it--do it sooner rather than later. After we gave away our cats (before we got the rats), it took a couple of years for all the dander to work its way out of the house. (The rat dander took less time because it was contained to one room.) But now, my asthma is basically gone. I only need my inhalers when I visit people who have pets.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with a tough decision.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438639877">Been there done that.  My son (about to turn 6) suffers from asthma.  We have actually had to make ER trips and 2 years ago spent Christmas Eve being rushed via ambulance to a children&#39;s hospital where he was hooked up to all kinds of machines etc.... It was horrible but the alternative was worse.  <br/>
<br/>
My son, even at 4, would help set-up the nebulizer (now we use an inhaler with a spacer), put the mask on over his head and then sit in my lap and watch tv or look at books.  <br/>
<br/>
I did a search (kids asthma videos) and there were several sites for kids to watch videos (Sesame Street included) to explain asthma in terms that a 4 yr old might better understand.  Also, if he sees other children using the nebulizers, inhalers etc...that might help.  <br/>
