<div id="ygrps-yiv-433860624">Hi,  I am an unschooling mom from AZ.  We live in a rural area of<br/>
wildernss, gardens, horses and creeks.  I think the term &quot;crunchy&quot; has<br/>
been used.  I am a photographer, artist and writer and my family manages<br/>
a remote environmental education and research center.  I have two<br/>
teenagers who are in school now (unschooled til 8th grade) and my<br/>
daughter (almost 10) has never been to school.  I look forward to being<br/>
part of this wonderful group.<br/>
<br/>
I (just this month) published an article in Life Learning Magazine<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/1008/index.htm">http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/1008/index.htm</a>&gt;  which most of you<br/>
probably already know is a great treasure.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of catch up reading to do; Can&#39;t wait to meet you all.<br/>
<br/>
