<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008616838">Hey all,<br/>
I&#39;m the single mom of a sunny, sociable, amazing-as-all-heck two year old<br/>
girl. We live in NYC, and I&#39;m intending to unschool her. But I feel like<br/>
we&#39;re stuck in a rut -- I know there must be so many wonderful things to do<br/>
with her in NYC, and so many exciting places for her to experience new<br/>
things. But it feels like we&#39;re stuck in the same rut of park, the one or<br/>
two friends that she has, and neighborhood errands.<br/>
I would love to connect with some parents who intended to unschool from this<br/>
age, and hear about things that you did with your toddlers...especially if<br/>
anyone can recommed great things in the NYC area...maybe I just need a<br/>
little inspiration.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Britt, mama to Bella Nysa<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705007079">For a two year old, park, one or two friends and<br/>
errands like grocery stores is plenty. Really! I think<br/>
you are feeling the rut more than she is.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not in NYC, but here are some ideas that may or<br/>
may not apply.<br/>
<br/>
Check out the library. They often have story-time for<br/>
toddlers.<br/>
<br/>
Museums that have hands-on stuff are good as are zoos.<br/>
But both were often not worth the money when my kids<br/>
were little. They were perfectly happy seeing ducks<br/>
and geese at nearby ponds.<br/>
<br/>
My kids enjoyed playing with playdoh and finger<br/>
paints. And bath tub crayons. And bubble baths<br/>
<br/>
