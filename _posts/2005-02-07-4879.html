<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182853696">Hey Tracy.  Chill Out.  You posted for some advice.  I was  just giving some <br/>
in a nice way.  Maybe you should have taken it that  way.   I am not a martyr <br/>
to my kids, I am just stating that we all  work together.  They are not told <br/>
that their allowance is a paycheck and if  you don&#39;t do your work, you don&#39;t <br/>
get paid.  I said I keep it in my  head.  And as for my husband, what makes you <br/>
think I even have one.   You are not a friend setting at a table having a cup <br/>
of tea with me, your just  trying to make me feel inadequate.  Well, enough <br/>
said, I don&#39;t need to  explain myself to you.<br/>
 <br/>
Have a good day<br/>

-=-Hey Tracy.  Chill Out.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I was chilled out when I wrote my post.  :)<br/>
<br/>
-=-You posted for some advice.  I was just giving some<br/>
in a nice way.  Maybe you should have taken it that way.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t ask for any advice.  That was someone else&#39;s post.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They are not told that their allowance is a paycheck and if<br/>
you don&#39;t do your work, you don&#39;t get paid.  I said I keep it in<br/>
my head.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s still there whether or not it&#39;s verbalized.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And as for my husband, what makes you think I even have one.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you do or if you don&#39;t, Cheryl, but if you do/did then <br/>
the question is still applicable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You are not a friend setting at a table having a cup of<br/>
tea with me, your just trying to make me feel inadequate.<br/>
Well, enough said, I don&#39;t need to  explain myself to you.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right . . . you don&#39;t have to explain yourself to me.  The list <br/>
guidelines say:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;2)  Please only post issues/topics that you are open to discussing.<br/>
If it&#39;s in your message, it&#39;s open to discussion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was discussing what was being posted.  I never attacked you.  I even <br/>
prefaced my reply with a &quot;this is being said in a nice way&quot; kind of <br/>
thing, but, hey, I don&#39;t have any say on how anyone will take it.<br/>
<br/>
I was not mean or rude to you in my post and certainly not any <br/>
accusations of inadequacy.  How you choose to interpret my post is up <br/>
to you.  You don&#39;t have to read it.  You don&#39;t have to take any of the <br/>
advice given.  You don&#39;t even have to acknowledge that you read it.  <br/>
Nobody here will would ever know.<br/>
<br/>
But *you* were not being discussed.  Ideas were being discussed.  I <br/>
hope that clears a few things up.  :)<br/>
