<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054983560">DS gets $5 per week payable twice per month when I get paid. I recently<br/>
asked him if he was good with that number (it&#39;s been the same amount<br/>
since he was about 5 or 6). He pondered a bit and decided that it was<br/>
fine but he&#39;d let me know if it wasn&#39;t enough at some point :-) <br/>
<br/>
As far as a your littlest, I think I&#39;d set the &#39;share&#39; of money aside<br/>
but just keep it in my pocket so it&#39;s available for her - that is,<br/>
instead of dividing the funds 3 ways, divide it 4 ways but don&#39;t<br/>
necessarily hand it over to her. Depending on her (since all kids are<br/>
different), you might explain to her that everybody in the family gets x<br/>
amount of money for their own &#39;stuff&#39; - perhaps put it into an<br/>
equivalence she understands ... for DS, comparing monetary values/cost<br/>
of something to Burger King kid&#39;s meals worked well - he didn&#39;t know the<br/>
dollars and cents but he could evaluate &quot;do I want/value Z as much as a<br/>
kid&#39;s meal?&quot; But, in the end, you&#39;ll have to judge whether she&#39;s at a<br/>
point where it even connects with her or if you can just have it on hand<br/>
for if she wants something. However, given that there&#39;ll be discussion<br/>
of funds and all going on with the family, she might want &#39;her&#39; money<br/>
tucked into her bag or pig bank. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289204608">Tamara,<br/>
<br/>
We have been there and just recently were able to remember what spending money is. It is a very hard and worrisome situation. My husband and I would make a list of things that were needed and things that were wanted for ourselves and for our son and daughter. Our son is 4 yrs old but he does understand that you need money to get things. We helped our daughter with her list and told her that it was her choice to get wants over needs and she learned that needs came first and if there was money left from that it went to wants or was saved up over a period of time to get the want item(s). We helped our son decide by explaining to him that if he needed new shoes and wanted something that if he got the fun thing he sometimes wouldn&#39;t have enough to get the need thing. I got extra check registers from the bank and set one up for each of the kids so they could keep track and they each have their own piggy bank. It has taken some time but they did learn to make<br/>
 good choices. It took a few times of mommy and daddy getting kiddo needs instead so that they would have what they needed. <br/>
<br/>
We did divide the money equally between the 4 of us. The kids have learned fiscal responsibility. Now even when we go to the store for a regular grocery shopping or to get things for the garden or art supplies or whatever. They know we have to look carefully at prices and determine things that have to be bought before we get things that we simply just want. We are still dividing up the left over money and keeping the amounts that we all have the same as when we were on a very tight budget. We did ours weekly so the kids are getting $10 per week. Right now most of it is going into their own banks because there are some big ticket items that they would like. We are covering their needs as part of our budget since there really are so many things. <br/>
<br/>
I am proud of them both for learning frugality (not penny pinch misers) and fiscal responsibility. This weekend my son should have enough for his spiderman bike and new helmet. My daughter has decided that she wants a small sewing machine and should be able to get that this weekend as well. Since they have had to save for their wants we have also noticed that they take better care of their things. We weren&#39;t at first but we learned quickly that we needed to be honest with them about finances. It is very hard for children at first to understand why we can&#39;t just go out and buy everything we see. We didn&#39;t do it in a OMG we are so broke kind of way. We simply sat down and said we have X amount of dollars and X amount of expenses. These expenses need to be covered before we can do anything else. So there were some weeks where spending money was not available. But it was ok because the expenses were covered and we were able to at least relax and know that<br/>
 all was well even if there wasn&#39;t any extra.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055634237">Tamara, I really don&#39;t have any advice. I just wanted to say that I love this idea. I may steal it -- it seems like a more natural way to learn about money than having me hand out an arbitrarily chosen amount each month.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349192380">I think it will work better with my income, which can vary 300% or more between pay periods, and cannot be easily predicted.  I wish I could figure out a good way to make the spending money payday come more often, but I haven&#39;t been able to make my budget work on shorter time scales.  Expenses are just too lumpy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-309274345">I&#39;m loving this. I know a girl who&#39;s 20 and her parents didn&#39;t even buy her clothes when she was in high school. I think it&#39;s terrible. Their excuses were that they had just gotten out of a bankruptcy and her mom was on so many meds she &quot;forgot&quot; her daughter NEEDED clothes. What&#39;s worse is they live and lived at that time on the lake in our town. I&#39;m glad there are parents like me who will give their last dollar to their child. I was proud of my son today. He used my debit card and got 2 manga books. (I was out of cash and he left his money at home.) He didn&#39;t even ask but it&#39;s been a while since he got any and was going to the book store with my BF&#39;s daughter. I hate having to say &quot;no&quot; because of lack of money. This has helped me realize I&#39;m not &quot;spoiling&quot; my son as so many people say. <br/>
