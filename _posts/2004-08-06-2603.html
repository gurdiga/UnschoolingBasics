<div id="ygrps-yiv-722447095">&quot;AND the second year. I has him both times. I&#39;m guessing you were chasing  <br/>
Jalen that hour! &lt;G&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Must have been a major Jalen chasing hour...or maybe that was at the point I decided I wasn&#39;t going to hear ANY speakers and gave up. sigh...<br/>
Next year he&#39;ll be 4.5 AND I&#39;ll have a husband around to help chase.<br/>
I may actually have one entire conversation. Cool.<br/>
