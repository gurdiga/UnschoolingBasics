<br/>
Must be why so many Unschoolers are either entrepreneurs or have found the<br/>
work they love. School is not like any job I ever did.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;if parents <br/>
let their kids be creative at home ENOUGH.......the bad teachers in <br/>
the world can&#39;t smash that imagination..it&#39;s way too strong if <br/>
parents allow their kids to use it!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope she is letting her kids use theirs, and that it is enough. I really<br/>
do. But it sure is taking a risk. Some kids do thrive &quot;enough&quot; in school. I<br/>
hope she is not putting unrealistic expectations on her kids, and that they<br/>
don&#39;t currently have bad teachers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m at a complete loss how to respond to her em!  Her children are in <br/>
ps of course, so she is defending it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my take:<br/>
<br/>
What might you be doing/saying that is causing her to feel the need to<br/>
defend public school and her choice to have her kids in it? I mean aside<br/>
from just being alive and happy in Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the conversation started with her grumbling about school, and you said<br/>
that she had a choice. School bashing is easy. Letting go of the security<br/>
that is part of doing what the greater part of society sanctions is not<br/>
easy. Defending what she may in heart see as a &quot;necessary evil&quot; means that<br/>
she and her family are not ready. Maybe they will become so one day and be<br/>
ready to drop the &quot;necessary&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I personally do not get involved in school conversations. People who know I<br/>
homeschool sometimes want to start defending school to me. I just don&#39;t do<br/>
those conversations. It is not up to me to make people feel better about the<br/>
choice to stay in the system. I will gladly talk about *what* we do which<br/>
seems to fascinate people, but I have found that talking about *why* we do<br/>
it sometimes raises defenses, unless the person is actually considering it.<br/>
I try to just let it wash over me with a general response like, &quot;we&#39;re<br/>
really happy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do curriculum or &quot;how do I *get* her to....&quot; or reading list<br/>
conversations either with my local group.<br/>
<br/>
This is just me. Other people will have better things to suggest. But one<br/>
thing I urge you to contemplate is why you feel you have to respond to her,<br/>
or change her mind, at all. That may give you an idea for what to say to<br/>
her. Many people have found that the proof is in the pudding so to speak,<br/>
when your friends see what charming, interesting and well-informed<br/>
adolescents your have in the home. Others simply recommend some reading.<br/>
John Taylor Gatto might rock her world.<br/>

 <br/>
That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to avoid school at ALL costs!<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s easy to learn to accept this as truth and as the way it must be.  To <br/>
never really enjoy the work you&#39;ve chosen. To be told what to do and how to  do <br/>
it. To work for assholes and be grateful for that privilege.<br/>
 <br/>
The work you choose *should* be doing what you love. School has taught  <br/>
millions of people exactly what you friend believes (she&#39;s been brainwashed!  &lt;g&gt;): <br/>
that you must be miserable in school so that you can learn to be  miserable <br/>
in your job.<br/>
 <br/>
With unschooling you learn to go with your passions and feed them and make  <br/>
them your life&#39;s work. To be happy and to find joy in learning and being and  <br/>
doing! If a child gets NOTHING else out of unschooling, this should be it!<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Yeah, and it&#39;s sad that your friend&#39;s imagination has been smashed so much  <br/>
that she can&#39;t even see past this ridiculous thinking!----Well, she&#39;s right:  <br/>
there ARE kids who make it through school with their imaginations still in <br/>
tact.  But there are many *more* who don&#39;t. Given a choice between school and a  <br/>
wonderful home, filled with imagination and joy and unschooling &lt;g&gt;, I&#39;d  pick <br/>
the unschooling life---NO chance of imagination-smashing! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
You can&#39;t change her thinking until *she* is ready to change her thinking!  <br/>
Just live your unschooling life as joyfully as you can. As your children get  <br/>
older and more interesting and hers are dulled by school, she may change her  <br/>
tune. Proof is in the pudding!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want to prepare my daughter for work like that. If she *chooses*<br/>
work like that, she&#39;ll have reasons why putting up with that atmosphere<br/>
makes sense for her. (For instance, maybe she&#39;s learning a lot. Maybe the<br/>
boss will be leaving soon. Maybe the work is challenging and interesting.)<br/>
<br/>
Kids are *forced into* an atmosphere like that in school to get something<br/>
they don&#39;t want. And they don&#39;t get to freely choose that atmosphere nor<br/>
what they get out of putting up with the atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
So basically they&#39;re being trained to accept that life offers nothing better<br/>
than &quot;someone&#39;s always telling you what to do, how to do it, and if you<br/>
think you have a good idea....they&#39;ll smash it down&quot; and that&#39;s just not<br/>
true nor something I want my daughter to believe.<br/>

&gt; parents allow their kids to use it!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a decent theory but what data does she have to back it up?<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers have real unschoolers to back up what they say about interest<br/>
being the foundation of living and learning :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think the outcome of her scenario is highly dependent on children&#39;s<br/>
personalities. Some kids will take what other adults say to heart and no<br/>
amount of mom saying &quot;No, that&#39;s not true&quot; is going to change their minds.<br/>
They&#39;ll feel mom&#39;s just speaking from her heart and the teacher is seeing<br/>
what&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
Despite freedom to watch what I wanted and read what I wanted, it took me<br/>
many years to recover from a dislike of history. I saw so many wonderful<br/>
movies and read intriguing books, but history itself turned me off because<br/>
it was tainted by school history texts.<br/>
<br/>
It really wasnt until I was in my late 30&#39;s that I could recognize a lot of<br/>
the false school messages in my head and see that they were wrong. And my<br/>
creativity was never squashed at home.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t depend on any particular personality of the child to<br/>
work. It works for all children, independent of their personality and<br/>
learning style and interests.<br/>

sent a poem that someone on this list had posted.  I really liked it, <br/>
so sent it to a few people.  I think from now on I won&#39;t be doing <br/>
that anymore.<br/>
  Anyway, I didn&#39;t really respond to her remarks, I just let it go.  <br/>
But it got me to thinking, what if it were all asked to me in person, <br/>
what would I say???  So that was the reason for asking for <br/>
suggestions.<br/>
