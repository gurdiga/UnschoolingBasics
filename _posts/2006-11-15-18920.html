<div id="ygrps-yiv-932599002">Hi Deanna,<br/>
  I usually only lurk also.My 2 ds (6 and almost 12) are both  still in our family bed.<br/>
  The 11 yr old  is once in a while sleeping on the couch in the family room,so I suspect it will not be much longer,and I will miss it:o)<br/>
  I have 3 others that are all grown and on their own that were not as old<br/>
  ( between 8 and 10) when they left the bed.<br/>
  Hope this helps,<br/>

  I have co-slept with all three of my boys.  With my first I was a single Mom until he was almost 10.  He always started the night in his own bed, then usually moved to mine in the very-early morning hours, until he was about 8-ish.  Andy shared our bed every night, until his younger brother came along when he was 4.5.  For the first few months, he continued to sleep with us, tho it eventually got crowded.  Until he was 7 or so, dh would lie down with Andy, often falling asleep and spending most of the night with Andy, while I slept with Dan.  Somewhere around 8, Andy started staying up late watching TV to fall asleep, after reading with dh, and he wouldn&#39;t dream of climbing into our bed now at 10.  Dan, at 5.5, is still in our bed every night.  About half the time, he will ask to snuggle with me or dh in bed and fall asleep that way, the other half, he passes out on the couch, and we move him to our bed later.  He weaned just shy of his 5th birthday, so until that time,<br/>
 he nursed to sleep with me.  Rarely, he&#39;ll fall asleep in his own bed watching TV.  When he does that, we usually leave him there -- unless we know dh won&#39;t feel like waking to get Dan at 3am! -- he&#39;s not made it all night just yet.  He blames it on the dog or cat making too much noise.....<br/>
   <br/>
  So, based on my experience 8 is the average age for the end of co-sleeping, but your mileage may vary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110391331">Simon stayed in our bedroom, not in our bed, until he was 7 or 8. If there were more room I imagine he would return occassionally. Actually, recently, we moved to the biggest bedroom briefly and he came and joined us for a little while. He sleeps on the couch most nights. Never in his own room. <br/>
<br/>
Linnaea, who is 6, still sleeps with us. She has spent nights away and nights in her own room, but mostly she sleeps with us. I have no idea when that won&#39;t be. But, than, I have no aspirations for her to leave. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose the most limiting aspect of our sleep arrangements has nothing to do with where anyone sleeps. It is more about when. David (dh) goes to sleep between 9:00 and 11:00 most nights. Simon and Linnaea tend to stay up &#39;til closer to midnight. Both like me to cuddle them to sleep. So, by the time I get to bed David is deeply asleep and I&#39;m tired. That is far more limiting on my night-time freedom than sharing a room. <br/>
<br/>
David has just put together a paper on child stress and co-sleeping. Apparently children who co-sleep have lower stress levels, and return to a more normal level after a stressful encounter than do their non-cosleeping peers. I&#39;ve always liked having those sorts of stats in my head so that I can answer any of those little niggles or naysayers whenever I feel required to do so. Maybe it will help you feel better too.<br/>

<br/>
My now 10 year old wanted to move to his own bed shortly after we had our <br/>
second child - too crowded in a queen bed for his taste.  He was 4 at the <br/>
time.  He still came in with us now and then but now sleeps so hard through <br/>
the night that he never does this anymore.  My now 6 year old still climbs <br/>
in with us in the middle of the night now and then, but generally starts out <br/>
the night in the bed he shares with his older brother.<br/>
<br/>
I have a disability, and insomnia is a big part of it.  It is hard for me to <br/>
have my son come in with us in the middle of the night and then sleep <br/>
because he&#39;s a flopper.  I&#39;ve found that if I take him back to his bed and <br/>
lie with him for a while, he&#39;ll go back to sleep quite quickly and be happy. <br/>
I can then go back to my bed and TRY to fall asleep.  I also find that if I <br/>
lie with the boys for a bit when they go to bed, they will tend to stay in <br/>
bed all night.  Maybe it&#39;s that they had the closeness they needed when they <br/>
fell asleep and sleep better.  I don&#39;t know.  I can see the 6 year old <br/>
starting to sleep harder, like his brother, and the times he comes in are <br/>
getting less and less often.  But I make no issue of it when he comes in and <br/>
actually give him some props when he makes it through the night in his own <br/>
bed, only because it makes such a huge difference in my sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably not all that helpful, but all I can say is that I know they <br/>
will be off, sleeping completely on their own, soon enough.  While I do <br/>
appreciate the empty bed now and then, I just remind myself how soon they <br/>
will be gone and how much I will likely long for that nighttime cuddle.  It <br/>
makes me appreciate it all a bit more and be MUCH more patient with the <br/>
whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps a bit.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137089414">Lol, so we&#39;re not the only one who still has a child in the bed!  <br/>
It&#39;s nice to know that other families feel this way.<br/>
My relatives think we&#39;re nuts not forcing the kids into their own beds from birth,<br/>
but we never believed in that.  When they want their own space, they move <br/>
happily on their own.  Both our teenagers sleep in their own beds now or sometimes on <br/>
the couch.  This time in life goes by so fast, enjoy each and every moment of it.<br/>
It&#39;s also nice to hear that others also believe in extended nursing.  Another period <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741774569">My kids start out in their own room.  Typically i lay down with one of them <br/>
and my husband with the other. they share a room.  We both get up either <br/>
just before they have fallen asleap or after.  Somewhere around midnight <br/>
most nights both kids come in get in bed with us.  Some nights if i have <br/>
trouble sleeping i go in there room after they are safely in ours.  They are <br/>
almost 4 and 5.  Maybe once a week one of them sleeps all night in his own <br/>
bed.  I doubt this will end anytime soon but I am not wishing for it to.  I <br/>
like that they start the night out in their own room as it gives my dh and I <br/>
some time to ourselves. But the nights that they dont come in i dont think i <br/>
sleep as well and honestly I miss them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463149863">Wow, thanks for all your responses.  It helps me see that this was a <br/>
conscious choice on our part, which helps me to remember the reasons to <br/>
see it through to the point where it is my child&#39;s secure choice to <br/>
sleep on his own.  He just turned 9, so I can&#39;t imagine it will really <br/>
be too much longer.  And I will probably feel nostalgic remembering <br/>
the &quot;cuddly good-old-days&quot;!  <br/>
<br/>
Someone made reference to stress levels and how cosleeping can help <br/>
reduce stress.  DS started to sleep a bit on his own, but then DH had a <br/>
bout with some health issues, ended up in the hospital twice and had <br/>
major surgery recently.  No wonder DS climbed back into bed with us!  <br/>

believe me), and my husband had to work.  He had been sleeping most of the <br/>
night with his brother prior to that but REALLY wanted to have his brother <br/>
and me in bed with him for quite a while after that.  In fact, he barely <br/>
wanted either of us to leave his side for quite a while.  Stress, traumas <br/>
and unusual situations and such can really impact things like this with <br/>
little ones - with big ones too!<br/>

&gt; Wow, thanks for all your responses.  It helps me see that this was a<br/>
&gt; conscious choice on our part, which helps me to remember the reasons to<br/>
&gt; see it through to the point where it is my child&#39;s secure choice to<br/>
&gt; sleep on his own.  He just turned 9, so I can&#39;t imagine it will really<br/>
&gt; be too much longer.  And I will probably feel nostalgic remembering<br/>
&gt; the &quot;cuddly good-old-days&quot;!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Someone made reference to stress levels and how cosleeping can help<br/>
&gt; reduce stress.  DS started to sleep a bit on his own, but then DH had a<br/>
&gt; bout with some health issues, ended up in the hospital twice and had<br/>
&gt; major surgery recently.  No wonder DS climbed back into bed with us!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again.<br/>

  we have had up to three kids in the bed at a time!!  after sadie was born, samuel started sleeping in his bed....only after he fell asleep with me (his dad comes home late, so going to bed with the three in the bed was easy, then scotty would just put samuel into his bed when he came home).<br/>
   <br/>
  sadie is 6.5 and still in our bed.  she had a 3 month period this summer of wanting to sleep in her bed (we put our futon in her playroom and when she requested her own bed just pulled it out into a bed).  it was the weirdest thing...i would tuck her in and she would just go to sleep..WITHOUT ME...it felt weird to go back to the living room and just have nothing to do because the kids were all in bed...again, WITHOUT ME.  believe me, the time they need us to be so close is so so so small compared to the amount of time they will not need us so close.  by giving him the security now, means that he will probably always feel safe even when he&#39;s in his own bed.<br/>
   <br/>
  i don&#39;t know when sadie will decide to sleep in her bed again, but we have a king size and it isn&#39;t so bad.  although she does sometimes scoot completely into the middle of the bed and i am squashed between her and daddy.  but it is cozy.  i love watching her sleep.  i love listening to her night noises.  and her breathing.  it is something i treasure and will miss when it is over.<br/>
   <br/>
  peace,<br/>

This is more a parenting issue -- feel free to respond privately if it <br/>

My question is regarding cosleeping. It has been something our small <br/>
family has believed in, and so has felt very natural that we do it. We <br/>
have one child, who feels secure and safe in the same room or bed <br/>
sleeping with one or both parents, even though he knows we leave the <br/>
room for a bit at times. How long has this desire for cosleeping <br/>
continued in other families? I know it probably varies for every <br/>
child, but I am curious....and admittedly selfishly looking towards <br/>
more night-time freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts would be welcome.<br/>

  Our 3 year old sleeps with us on a regular basis. When he is not in our bed he is in with his sisters. Sometimes even the two girls come sleep with us. They are 8 and 10. <br/>
  If we want to be alone we ask them to sleep in their own bed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-620083861">I have so enjoyed reading all the different stories about co-<br/>
sleeping from so many... I co-sleep w/ my two kids and it&#39;s so nice <br/>
to read about others that do so. I, again, think my in-laws are <br/>
horrified about the whole thing. I guess I just don&#39;t understand the <br/>
whole ideology of &#39;pushing the baby birds out of the nest as soon as <br/>
possible&#39; that seem to be the mindset very popular now. Putting kids <br/>
in daycare at 6wks, nursing them for a few months if at all, etc etc <br/>
etc... I don&#39;t mean to offend anyone by writing that, but I just am <br/>
so GLAD and RELIEVED to read posts from people who are choosing the <br/>
same things I am and ENJOYING it. I am still nursing my Lil&#39; Miss <br/>
who turns two next month... I am reticent to give it up but I am <br/>
being pressured to do so from many who think she is much too old for <br/>
it anymore... So reading your posts about children much older than <br/>
that still nursing did me some real good! Thanks so much for all the <br/>
lovely stories. I, too, think I will really miss my kids sleeping <br/>
with us when they go on to thier own beds. I think I sleep better <br/>
for having them close by as well. Attachement parenting is really, I <br/>
think, the natural human continuum and I feel sorry, really, for <br/>
people that don&#39;t allow themselves to experience it. Well.... <br/>
Haven&#39;t I just gone on and on... Have a lovely night!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145362037">I thought my daughter would be in my bed forever. Shortly after she<br/>
turned 3 we made a huge deal out of the &quot;big girl bed&quot; and sheets and<br/>
a rainbow bed tent.  She took right to it!  She crawls into bed with<br/>
us almost every night, but it is long after my husband and I have gone<br/>
to bed.  So now I have the best of both worlds, i get hubby snuggles<br/>
to put me to sleep and in the morning I get snuggles from my daughter.<br/>
