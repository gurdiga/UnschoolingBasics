<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292916340">I need ideas, advice, help, info.....lol....ANYTHING! Okay, my <br/>
daughter has made the decision, and has been pondering it for a <br/>
couple years actually, to not eat meat. No beef, poultry, fish and so <br/>
on. She said she just cannot stand the thought any longer of animals <br/>
being killed for her food. While many I know do not have the same <br/>
feelings about this and many do, she does. She is 13 years old and is <br/>
very sweet. She is not doing this for any other reason than the one <br/>
mentioned. She has also informed me that is the eggs we eat &quot;could&quot; <br/>
become chickens if we did not eat them then she no longer wants to <br/>
eat those as well.<br/>
<br/>
She actually tried this a couple years ago and we did not think much <br/>
of it because we thought it would go a couple days, maybe even a week <br/>
or so but would end. She went 6 months, but ate fish and eggs, and <br/>
said she could not stand the feeling of being constantly hungry as <br/>
well as a sick feeling as well as tired all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Now I should also mention that she is a VERY picky eater which does <br/>
not make this any easier. She said she will try and learn to like <br/>
foods she does not currently like. She does not eat lettuce, <br/>
tomatoes, cucumbers, apples, carrots, pears, radishes.....I am sure <br/>
their is more.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone offer any ideas on what I can feed her? What about <br/>
supplements? ANY info is greatly appreciated. It does not matter if <br/>
it is a recipe, a way to eat, vitamin ideas, tips...anything. The <br/>
more the better as I know my daughter is mature enough to make this <br/>
decision and even if she is unable to keep with it I know she <br/>
desperately wants to and I want to do anything I can to help. I am <br/>
currently on the path to a healthier me as it is so it would not hurt <br/>
me either. Thank you soooo much for any info you can offer and I am <br/>
sorry if you see this post on another group as I am just posting this <br/>
to the ones I belong to to try and get as much advice as I can!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330964556">I am new here, and this is my first post.  First off, my name is Lora and I <br/>
have two boys, 7 and 4 and we are exploring unschooling and LOVE the idea of <br/>
incorporating this into our lives.<br/>
<br/>
As far as your daughter, I would go to the library and let her explore some <br/>
receipe books on being basically a vegan.  There are a ton of receipe <br/>
websites also.  I have eliminated meats, etc., from my diet and I feel great <br/>
about it.  It is actually easy once you get the hang of it.  My children are <br/>
in the grocery store with me frequently saying, &quot;Mom, we are not eating meat <br/>
anymore , right?  It is better to eat fruits and vegetables.&quot;  They are so <br/>
sweet!  :-)  We enjoy exploring new tastes and foods.<br/>
<br/>
As far as supplements go, there are a ton out of them.  We personally use <br/>
Juice Plus.  You can go to their website at www.juiceplus.com and read up on <br/>
it.  We love it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Lora<br/>

 <br/>
My daughter who is now almost 18 made the choice to become a vegetarian  when <br/>
she was 12 and is still a complete vegetarian.  We have never been big  meat <br/>
eaters and I have also gone through years when I chose to be vegetarian.  <br/>
However, both my husband and son eat meat, chicken and fish.<br/>
 <br/>
I have found that most recipes using any kind of ground meat are easily  <br/>
changed to some kind of soy substitute so I make most family recipes using  that.  <br/>
Some examples are tacos, chili, spaghetti.  When we have  lasagne, I usually <br/>
make half with meat and half with spinach or other  vegies.  When we have <br/>
hamburgers, we just make some of them vegie  burgers.<br/>
 <br/>
Some other staples are pasta with various kinds of red or white sauces, a  <br/>
variety of cheeses, yogurts, hummus for dipping or just as a spread, peanut or  <br/>
other nut butters as well as nuts in general provide protein. Beans are a  <br/>
great source of protein and can also be used in most recipes. We also keep  <br/>
protein bars on hand and she will sometimes grab one on the way out the  door.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d suggest going to a natural food store in your area and just spend some  <br/>
time with her looking at all the options and try some new things each  week.  I <br/>
think you&#39;ll be surprised at how many options she has and how easy  it is to <br/>
have just part of your family vegetarian.<br/>

*************************<br/>
Remind her that *only* those hens that are with a rooster would ever get to <br/>
become chickens. Hens lay eggs..it&#39;s only when a rooster *dances* with them <br/>
that the eggs are fertilized and *could* become chickens.<br/>
Many people are unaware of this.<br/>
 <br/>
We are sooo with your daughter and we are gradually lessening the amount of <br/>
meat in our diets too, and even more so after reading the book, The China Study.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m trying to make more things with beans and also substituting the meat in <br/>
recipes with veggies instead, and am using whole grains.<br/>
Check out some books on the topic and cookbooks from the library..and on the <br/>
internet!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-768027797">My 14 yr old recently became a vegetarian.... she is a good eater and<br/>
likes most all vegetables etc so it&#39;s a bit easier for us.  I already<br/>
cook alot of vegetables along with whatever meat we eat so it&#39;s not<br/>
been a huge transition for her.   I make sure we always have hummus,<br/>
yogurt (you didn&#39;t say if your daughter was going to continue to drink<br/>
milk or drinks milk currently), fruit, vegetables for salads, pasta (I<br/>
buy the Barilla Plus which is not completely whole wheat but less<br/>
white flour) also peanut butter or other nut butters... whole wheat<br/>
breads.  Basically you have to raise the quality of what she does<br/>
eat...if she eats pasta go more whole grain so it&#39;s a more hearty<br/>
meal.   My daughter makes smoothies each day with yogurt, frozen<br/>
berries (I buy a frozen berry blend at Sam&#39;s...BJ&#39;s has a similar one<br/>
that is organic)  and a splash of orange juice... you could add soy<br/>
protein powder or hemp protein powder to add some ump!   I also buy<br/>
those new steam bags .. I think ziploc and hefty make them now.... you<br/>
can put whatever veggies she likes in there for a quick steam.   My<br/>
daughter has begun to cook more and experiment in the kitchen more<br/>
now.   If your daughter likes potatoes that could make a great hearty<br/>
meal to have a baked potato with cheese or salsa if she likes that.  <br/>
I am not sure how you prepare your vegetables but I found with my<br/>
picky kids if you lightly steam something with a little salt, pepper<br/>
and butter they are more likely to eat it... overcooked veggies smell<br/>
bad and don&#39;t look very appetizing to a child.  I also buy lots of<br/>
Clif Bars , granola bars, and other higher nutritional quality snacks.<br/>
  My daughter made her decision based on her own reading and<br/>
researching and came to me and told me she didn&#39;t want to eat meat<br/>
anymore.   She wants to be a vet and reads alot of Temple Grandin&#39;s<br/>
books... Temple Grandin in an amazing PhD who has autism that has done<br/>
the bulk of her research in slaughter houses, fed lots etc... she&#39;s<br/>
developed more humane slaughter and enclosure systems for all types of<br/>
animals.  Anyway that reading brought my daughter to more indepth<br/>
reading and her decision not to eat meat.   She is still eating a<br/>
little fish and other seafood now and then.   You will have to help<br/>
your daughter figure out food quality so she will not be hungry... my<br/>
daughter has learned so much about nutrition!   She knows what foods<br/>
are high in protein (which is typically what keeps them from being<br/>
hungry!) and lots about how different foods are prepared (some<br/>
processing for foods that don&#39;t contain meat necessarily are still<br/>
prepared in ways that are unhealthy to animals and the environment!) <br/>
  Anyway I have found lots of great vegetarian recipes online ...<br/>
great recipe for Spicy Black Bean burgers that we all enjoy and many<br/>
others!  Personally I think that making a decision like this that may<br/>
not be in line with the family ...especially extended family ....is a<br/>
great way for kids to learn to really listen to their internal compass<br/>
and begin to know what they stand for!  Amazingly my dad who is the<br/>
biggest carnivore on the planet is very supportive of Anna&#39;s decision<br/>
... he asked her why she had decided not to eat meat, listened to her<br/>
and agreed that for her it did make sense that she would follow what<br/>
she felt was right.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359109236">Pressing the excess liquid out of a block of firm or extra-firm tofu and<br/>
then freezing it will give the texture of ground meat and can be used to<br/>
make chili, spaghetti, etc. Just treat it the same way you would meat ...<br/>
brown the thawed out crumbled tofu in a little oil and season it (maybe<br/>
season a little more than you would meat) and continue with your recipe.<br/>
Epicurious.com has a Cincinnati chili recipe that worked well for me when I<br/>
substituted tofu for the ground beef.<br/>
<br/>
Silken tofu blends up really nice in smoothies. I&#39;ve made a chocolate shake<br/>
for my kids with silken tofu and chocolate soy dream and a little flax seed<br/>
oil.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter was feeling hungry and sick she might have needed a little<br/>
more protein than she was taking in.<br/>
<br/>
Vegsource.com has lots of tips and recipes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-970595358">First, I think different people need somewhat different diets, based on<br/>
their metabolism type.<br/>
<br/>
Might not help much, but our child (almost four) has pretty much always been<br/>
a vegetarian. People always remark how tall they are for their age. Organic<br/>
milk, eggs (unfertilized, we have our own hens and no rooster, and feed<br/>
organic grain), cheese, and organic butter are eaten, as well as now those<br/>
new chocolate-flavored covered walnuts (for extra omega-3 fatty acids).<br/>
Fruit and and other veggies are eaten, mostly chosen on their own from<br/>
pre-washed in the fridge (though you say yours does not liek this -- maybe<br/>
if they grew their own?). Blueberries are a big hit. Likes beans and peas --<br/>
including from our garden.<br/>
<br/>
We tried a kid&#39;s supplement with extra omega-3 but our kid did not like it.<br/>
But we use a regular kids chewable supplement.<br/>
<br/>
Was a period of about a week after reading _Shiloh_ when several organic<br/>
nitrate-free hot dogs were eaten (they were fed to the dog in the book), but<br/>
that passed.<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.applegatefarms.com/">http://www.applegatefarms.com/</a><br/>
Occasionally a tiny piece of fish slips in. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe time for your daughter to have some chickens of her own? A bunch of<br/>
work though -- not so much to keep up with the chickens as to build and<br/>
maintain a coop and yard, especially if, like us, you have dogs who would<br/>
like to get in there. Maybe she might help a neighbor who already has a coop<br/>
and no rooster and get a few eggs a week in return? Also as chickens are<br/>
social, you need several, and that would make too many eggs for one kid. We<br/>
also scramble the extras for our dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Also, try stocking the freezer with &quot;Amy&#39;s&quot; frozen food.<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amyskitchen.com/">http://www.amyskitchen.com/</a><br/>
A little pricey, but well worth it -- usually organic stuff, and all<br/>
vegetarian dishes. It is a little pricey relative to other frozen foods, but<br/>
still probably cheaper than almost anything you buy when eating out, and<br/>
cheaper than dealing with health problems. Amy&#39;s might help your daughter<br/>
make a transition to more food variety, which she could then cook herself.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of books out there on vegetarian cooking -- for example, try &quot;The<br/>
Starving Student&#39;s Vegetarian Cookbook&quot; for example.<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Starving-Students-Vegetarian-Cookbook/dp/0446676756">http://www.amazon.com/Starving-Students-Vegetarian-Cookbook/dp/0446676756</a><br/>
<br/>
Also, try pasta and chili beans. I make the pasta in the microwave (about<br/>
twelve minutes in ours, adding a little salt and olive oil to the water),<br/>
and I use a hand can opener which does not leave sharp edges -- that tool is<br/>
a miracle and I found it in a big grocery store. Similar to this:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Grips-1049953-Smooth-Opener/dp/B000079XW2">http://www.amazon.com/Good-Grips-1049953-Smooth-Opener/dp/B000079XW2</a><br/>
Seems doable for a fourteen year old and fairly nutritious. I&#39;d stay away<br/>
from soaking beans for a while -- too much planning. Used good canned beans<br/>
or good canned chili, again, from Amy&#39;s (they do extra good on beans<br/>
compared with other brands). I&#39;ve also found you can dump an organic canned<br/>
soup over the pasta.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625492462"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have found that most recipes using any kind of ground meat are easily<br/>
 </span></blockquote>changed to some kind of soy substitute so I make most family recipes<br/>
using that. <br/>
I don&#39;t tolerate soy well so we&#39;ve found another option:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Basic bean & grain burger (from The Vegetarian Grill, page 136) makes 8<br/>
burgers/portions<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
2/3 C uncooked bulgur<br/>
<br/>
1 1/3 C boiling water<br/>
<br/>
1/2 C bread crumbs - 4 slices stale or toasted whole wheat bread or<br/>
about 1 C of whole grain O cereal whirred through the food processor<br/>
<br/>
1 1/2 C cooked kidney, pinto, or black beans or one 15 oz can, rinsed<br/>
and drained (we prefer pinto beans for this recipe)<br/>
<br/>
1/2 C chopped fresh parsley (we omitted this, didn&#39;t miss it)<br/>
<br/>
2 cloves garlic, minced (adjust to taste)<br/>
<br/>
1 large egg (or egg substitute - need something as a binding agent)<br/>
<br/>
2 tbl tomato paste (can use ketchup instead)<br/>
<br/>
1 tbl soy sauce (can use worcestershire instead)<br/>
<br/>
1 tbl chili powder (or omit this and use Italian seasoning instead, play<br/>
with the seasonings until you find what you like)<br/>
<br/>
salt & pepper to taste (we omitted this entirely)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1 - Combine bulgur and water in a bowl, cover, set it aside for 10<br/>
minutes<br/>
<br/>
2 - Process the bread (or cereal) in a food processor to make 1/2 C<br/>
crumbs<br/>
<br/>
3 - Combine beans, parsley, garlic in the food processor and pulse until<br/>
you have a fairly smooth mixture<br/>
<br/>
4 - Drain excess liquid from bulgur and stir into bean mixture<br/>
<br/>
5 - Add bread crumbs, egg, tomato paste, soy sauce, chili powder, salt,<br/>
pepper<br/>
<br/>
6 - Set aside for 30 minutes - it will thicken as it stands<br/>
<br/>
7 - Prepare medium fire in grill with lightly oiled vegetable grill rack<br/>
in place - we just used the pancake griddle over medium heat on the<br/>
stove<br/>
<br/>
8 - Shape into 8 3&quot; patties or 8 &quot;sausages&quot;<br/>
<br/>
9 - Grill until crisp on the outside - about 5 minutes per side for<br/>
patties; roll 1/4 turn approx every 2 minutes for &quot;sausages&quot; until it&#39;s<br/>
browned all over<br/>
<br/>
10 - Serve on buns, bread, or tortilla wraps with ketchup, salsa,<br/>
cheese, whatever<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
The basic mix, when using pintos, looks a lot like meatloaf. You can<br/>
make meatballs from it, burger patties, sausage shapes, etc. And, you<br/>
can cook it as &#39;crumbles&#39; as you would ground meat to use for<br/>
tacos/nachos, meat sauces, etc. Can be made ahead and reheated (cook up<br/>
all the meatballs or patties then microwave until warmed). The only<br/>
caveat I&#39;ve found so far is that once it&#39;s been mixed into a meat sauce<br/>
(for pasta for example), it has to be used - the sauce adds extra<br/>
moisture and it gets a bit mushy if it sits overnight and gets reheated<br/>
in this form. One big bonus is that it just needs to be warmed or<br/>
browned, no worries about &quot;rare meat&quot;, it just needs to cook enough for<br/>
the egg to cook and that&#39;s pretty minimal. It will brown nicely as a<br/>
patty and we love to brown up a bunch of meatballs then toss them with a<br/>
bit of our favorite BBQ sauce.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-798489485">We have been vegetarians for 30 years and our kids have never eaten any kind of meat. We do eat cheese, milk and eggs. <br/>
I work full time so its difficult sometimes to find the time to prepare meals, but I usually have a crockpot going with some kind of bean or lentil dish in it.<br/>
I also have a book called &quot;Fast Vegetarian Feasts&quot; that includes recipes that can be made in about 15 minutes. I recommend picking up something similiar at the bookstore and having your daughter experiment with the recipes and discover what she likes. There are quite a few &quot;quick vegetarian recipe&quot; books out there, some with wonderful recipes from around the world. The recipes are easy enough for anyone to try.<br/>

I need ideas, advice, help, info.....lol....ANYTHING! Okay, my <br/>
daughter has made the decision, and has been pondering it for a <br/>
couple years actually, to not eat meat. No beef, poultry, fish and so <br/>
on. She said she just cannot stand the thought any longer of animals <br/>
being killed for her food. While many I know do not have the same <br/>
feelings about this and many do, she does. She is 13 years old and is <br/>
very sweet. She is not doing this for any other reason than the one <br/>
mentioned. She has also informed me that is the eggs we eat &quot;could&quot; <br/>
become chickens if we did not eat them then she no longer wants to <br/>
eat those as well.<br/>
<br/>
She actually tried this a couple years ago and we did not think much <br/>
of it because we thought it would go a couple days, maybe even a week <br/>
or so but would end. She went 6 months, but ate fish and eggs, and <br/>
said she could not stand the feeling of being constantly hungry as <br/>
well as a sick feeling as well as tired all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Now I should also mention that she is a VERY picky eater which does <br/>
not make this any easier. She said she will try and learn to like <br/>
foods she does not currently like. She does not eat lettuce, <br/>
tomatoes, cucumbers, apples, carrots, pears, radishes.....I am sure <br/>
their is more.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone offer any ideas on what I can feed her? What about <br/>
supplements? ANY info is greatly appreciated. It does not matter if <br/>
it is a recipe, a way to eat, vitamin ideas, tips...anything. The <br/>
more the better as I know my daughter is mature enough to make this <br/>
decision and even if she is unable to keep with it I know she <br/>
desperately wants to and I want to do anything I can to help. I am <br/>
currently on the path to a healthier me as it is so it would not hurt <br/>
me either. Thank you soooo much for any info you can offer and I am <br/>
sorry if you see this post on another group as I am just posting this <br/>
to the ones I belong to to try and get as much advice as I can!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

<br/>
Cameron (19) has been an on&off vegetarian over his teen years. For the <br/>
same reasons.<br/>
<br/>
-=-===-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 She has also informed me that is the eggs we eat &quot;could&quot;<br/>
become chickens if we did not eat them then she no longer wants to<br/>
eat those as well.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Naw---just get unfertilized eggs---they can&#39;t become chicks no matter <br/>
how hard you sit on them! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She actually tried this a couple years ago and we did not think much<br/>
of it because we thought it would go a couple days, maybe even a week<br/>
or so but would end. She went 6 months, but ate fish and eggs, and<br/>
said she could not stand the feeling of being constantly hungry as<br/>
well as a sick feeling as well as tired all the time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Also why Cam has been on&off! He&#39;s gotten too tired as well as <br/>
&quot;stupid&quot;---like his brain wasn&#39;t functioning well. He didn&#39;t feel good. <br/>
This time, we discussed how he could make it work. He went to our local <br/>
health food store and talked a long tme about how it made him feel <br/>
before and how he could prevent it. She suggested a multi-vitamin wih <br/>
lots of &quot;B&quot;---which is lacking in many vegetarian diets.<br/>
<br/>
We also discussed many other protein options. Apparantly he wasn&#39;t <br/>
getting NEARLY enough before (he needs a lot). He also needs more iron <br/>
than the average male. Combined (low protien & low iron)---no wonder he <br/>
was pooped!<br/>
<br/>
Now he fixes two fried eggs every morning---almost without fail---as <br/>
well as toast with peanut butter. We always have a large tub of hummus <br/>
& flatbread or carrots to dip and plenty of yoghurt with granola for <br/>
snacks. I fix a lot of greens (I have low iron too). He&#39;s learning all <br/>
about soy substitutes (which I find repulsive), so I&#39;ll often make a <br/>
sauce or something with a bit left over before I add the meat, so that <br/>
he can add the soy.<br/>
<br/>
BEANS are your friends! &lt;G&gt; I made minestrone soup last night---chocked <br/>
full of beans (dark and light kidney and young green beans, cut up). <br/>
He&#39;s trying to make the perfect vegie burger. We&#39;ve tried black bean <br/>
and brown rice-based ones. Thyey were delicious, but not sturdy enough. <br/>
He and Brenna made some last weekend that were great! Had nuts in them. <br/>
Speaking of nuts---we always have a bowl of cashews or pecans or <br/>
walnuts or sunflower seeds or peanuts---ALWAYS!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Now I should also mention that she is a VERY picky eater which does<br/>
not make this any easier. She said she will try and learn to like<br/>

<br/>
THis is my pet peeve with vegetarians! &lt;BWG&gt; You guys really DO need to <br/>
eat VEGETABLES!<br/>
<br/>
One of Duncan&#39;s friends has a small list of foods she eats, but insists <br/>
that she is a vegetarian. &lt;G&gt; The list includes (and is practically <br/>
limited to!) french fries, chicken nuggets, sauceless pasta, and cheese <br/>
pizza. I keep finding those chicken nuggets to be *partially* about <br/>
meat! &lt;G&gt; But she eats almost no vegies---I think she&#39;ll eat a carrot <br/>
stick. It&#39;s really hard to feed her here!<br/>
<br/>
I think many adults prepare vegies to be unappealing to kids. Not on <br/>
purpose, of course! But either too raw or cooked to death and smothered <br/>
in stuff. Dips are GREAT!  *Lighly* steamed broccoli & asparagus with <br/>
just a simple lemon-butter to dip in. Grape tomatoes dipped in coarse <br/>
salt. Carrots in hummus (if she doesn&#39;t like them raw or cooked, try <br/>
lightly steaming to just get rid of the bitterness, but not so long <br/>
that it gets rid of the crunch). Also buying really *FRESH* fruits and <br/>
vegies! REALLY, REALLY fresh! Like *she* gets to pick them!<br/>
<br/>
But I would make sure she knows to keep the high-protein foods close <br/>
by!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>A couple of suggestions: check out The Vegetarian Grill cookbook - has <br/>
maybe 3 or 6 different recipes for bean based burgers (like the bulgur <br/>
and bean burger recipe I posted earlier). Also, they had a great <br/>
sidebar about how you really need a good, hearty, whole grain type bun <br/>
for these type burgers because they&#39;re softer to begin with; standard <br/>
soft fluffy buns just mush up. And, do NOT use oats as a bulker-upper <br/>
(is that a word? lol) many recipes include oats but that tends to make <br/>
things a bit gummy textured.<br/>
<br/>
DH makes an awesome veggie chili - black, white, pinto, and kidney <br/>
beans, tri-color bell peppers (red, yellow, green - our co-op sells <br/>
packs of pre sliced frozen organic peppers, we&#39;ve always got a couple <br/>
packs on hand for quick chilis and such), corn or mixed veggies, <br/>
tomato sauce, seasonings - a combo of ancho chili powder and chipotle <br/>
chili powder has turned out to be our favorite, just hot enough to be <br/>
chili for DH and mild/smoky enough that DS and I can eat it (we don&#39;t <br/>
like the really spicy burn-your-mouth stuff plus my reflux issues <br/>
won&#39;t tolerate it well). Teamed with a loaf of still warm whole wheat <br/>
or pumpernickel bread on a cold night - mmmmmm!<br/>
<br/>
Also, another good hearty (and protein rich) summer meal is cold brown <br/>
rice salad, we have two variants we like, sweet and savory: <br/>
Cold Rice Salad (sweet)<br/>
<br/>
5 C cooked brown basmati rice<br/>
1 C chopped carrots<br/>
½  sm. Onion, chopped<br/>
½ C raisins<br/>
½ C chopped pecans<br/>
Optional: ½ C dried cranberries; ¼ C unsalted sunflower seeds<br/>
¼ C balsamic vinegar (to taste)<br/>
¼ C olive oil (to taste)<br/>
2 tbl. maple syrup (to taste)<br/>
<br/>
Combine all ingredients, serve cold<br/>
<br/>
Cold Rice Salad (savory)<br/>
<br/>
5 C cooked brown basmati rice<br/>
1 large bell pepper, chopped<br/>
1 C chopped carrots<br/>
1 can diced tomato, drained (or fresh diced tomato)<br/>
¼ C balsamic vinegar (to taste)<br/>
¼ C olive oil (to taste)<br/>
1 tsp minced garlic (to taste)<br/>
1 tbl Italian seasoning (to taste)<br/>
<br/>
Combine all ingredients, serve cold<br/>
*can also add cooked, cooled beans of any sort (chick peas, black <br/>
beans, whatever) to the savory one for added protein. Brown basmati <br/>
rice itself has a nice serving of protein (12 grams per cup roughly). <br/>
You can also toss in some raw or lightly steamed broccoli as well. <br/>
<br/>
I love to toss a handful of broken up pecans onto my cereal in the <br/>
morning and we often have pecans and raisins tossed onto oatmeal in <br/>
the winter - adds a bit of protein and iron and texture (actually, <br/>
oatmeal at our house looks a lot like a make-your-own-sundae <br/>
party...we put out raisins, craisins if we have them, pecans, peanut <br/>
butter, honey, real maple syrup - DS won&#39;t touch the &#39;pancake syrup&#39; <br/>
stuff, chocolate chips, cinnamon, sugar, butter, almond milk - we <br/>
haven&#39;t used cow milk since late winter/early spring, and any other <br/>
tidbits we might have on hand that seem like they&#39;d be tasty).<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t claim to be vegetarian since we love sushi, eat tuna, and <br/>
like an occasional bit of chicken now and again but we prefer to eat a <br/>
plant-based diet. It&#39;s fun going out and re-arranging the menu to suit <br/>
what I want to eat (they really will do just about anything if they <br/>
have the components on the menu)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263191963">My dd 11 is a vegetarian (mostly) and dd7 likes to eat vegetarian if the<br/>
option is available.  I recently started meal planning with a book called<br/>
&quot;Saving Dinner the Vegetarian Way&quot;.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Dinner-Vegetarian-Way-Shopping/dp/0345485424">http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Dinner-Vegetarian-Way-Shopping/dp/0345485424</a><br/>
<br/>
It is organized by season and includes weekly shopping lists to go with each<br/>
group of 6 dinner recipes.  I really like using it to plan meals and then I<br/>
will add a meat &quot;side dish&quot; like a piece of chicken or beef for my son and<br/>
husband.  I find it much easier to start by assuming everyone will eat the<br/>
vegge meal then adding a bit of meat for the guys than the other way &#39;round.<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

I did not get a chance to read thru this entire thread, but I wanted<br/>
to second the recommendation for Isa&#39;s cookbooks, I have both and they<br/>
are wonderful, the cupcake one especially :)<br/>
also another good one is Vegetarian Family Cookbook by nava atlas, she<br/>
gives vegan alternatives to each recipe.<br/>
<br/>
another great book is Disease Proof your Child by Dr. Joel Fuhrman. <br/>
good luck!<br/>

&gt; Hi Kelly,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband and I are both vegans. Currently we are raising our kids  <br/>
&gt; ovo-lacto, but the majority of their diet is vegan. We give both  <br/>
&gt; quality multi-vitamins, which btw are vegetarian. They are called  <br/>
&gt; Animal Parade. Is she still planning to eat dairy? Vitamin B-12 can  <br/>
&gt; be a concern for vegans (who eat no animal products) but this will be  <br/>
&gt; in the multi-vitamin and added to so many non-animal products such as  <br/>
&gt; rice/soy milk. It is also in nutritional yeast. I&#39;ve a attached a  <br/>
&gt; link to Physician&#39;s Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM). They  <br/>
&gt; advocate a vegetarian/vegan diet (yes even for kids!) and have  <br/>
&gt; information that would probably answer any concerns you have like is  <br/>
&gt; she getting enough protein, iron, calcium, etc. They also have  <br/>
&gt; recipes to appeal to the kiddos! I would caution against just  <br/>
&gt; replacing meat or dairy with the soy alternatives. Many people do  <br/>
&gt; this when they first become vegetarian but those packaged soy  <br/>
&gt; alternatives are highly processed and not that healthy. Occasionally  <br/>
&gt; is fine, but everything in moderation. I know my vegetarian support  <br/>
&gt; group was necessary for me in the beginning. Maybe you have a local  <br/>
&gt; one that has potlucks and you can try new recipes. My favorite  <br/>
&gt; cookbook is Vegan With A Vengeance by Isa Chandra Moskowitz. It is  <br/>
&gt; awesome. Full of tasty, healthy recipes. If you have a sweet tooth  <br/>
&gt; she also has a cookbook called Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World  <br/>
&gt; (not necessarily healthy!). No animal products in any of these. I  <br/>
&gt; made some of her cupcakes for my son&#39;s birthday, and everyone told me  <br/>
&gt; they were the best they&#39;d ever had vegan or not. Most the people at  <br/>
&gt; the party weren&#39;t veggie. I could go on and on but my daughter is up  <br/>
&gt; now. Hopefully this will get you started. I&#39;m pretty passionate about  <br/>
&gt; a veggie lifestyle. It changed my life so much. I&#39;ve never felt  <br/>
&gt; better, or looked better for that matter:) My kids are growing off  <br/>
&gt; the charts as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Earth Balance is a good butter alternative.<br/>
&gt; Veganaise is a good mayo alternative.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I should also make it clear that in line with the unschooling  <br/>
&gt; philosophy if my children showed an interest in eating meat I would  <br/>
&gt; not stop them. I would find a way to meet their curiosity about it. I  <br/>
&gt; do it  for health, environment, ethics etc. But that is me. Since it  <br/>
&gt; is me (and my husband) we do not cook meat. However, we have eaten  <br/>
&gt; with people who do (and place NO judgement on them, so I&#39;m sure the  <br/>
&gt; kids would feel comfortable telling us they wanted to) and at this  <br/>
&gt; point they have no curiosity about it...<br/>

as related to metabolism and body type. There are quite a few <br/>
different ways of approaching the whole question of &quot;what does my <br/>
body need?&quot; and different approaches work better for different <br/>
people. Personally, I&#39;ve had good luck using ayurveda as a guide for <br/>
*me* - doesn&#39;t necessarily work for my partner, though. <br/>
<br/>
One of the differences in *our* metabolisms has to do with enzymes <br/>
and the way we digest vegetables. He does well with lots of raw or <br/>
lightly cooked greens, for example, and I can barely eat greens at <br/>
all, unless they&#39;re well cooked or fermented. I&#39;m bringing this up <br/>
in particular as a caveat to all the comments regarding veggies - <br/>
different bodies (even different vegetarian bodies) will handle <br/>
vegetables in different ways. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of my own &quot;pickiness&quot; wrt food has been resolved by honoring <br/>
my own tastes and actively seeking more foods that taste yummy to <br/>
me. That has helped broaden my diet far more than choking down <br/>
servings of vegetables I dislike.<br/>
<br/>
On that note, I&#39;ll recommend my current favorite food author, Sandor <br/>
Katz, who writes about fermentation, the need to listen to our <br/>
bodies and also the politics of food:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-792945497">Protein requirements are probably different for different people but <br/>
if she shoots for around fifty grams a day she&#39;d likely feel just <br/>
fine.  I never feel tired if I&#39;m low on protein, I feel tired if I&#39;m <br/>
low on calories,  but everyone&#39;s different. <br/>
<br/>
If there are some fruits she likes try a smoothie in the morning.  <br/>
They&#39;re filling and sweet.   If you make a fruit smoothie with soy <br/>
milk and add a little vegetarian protein powder, that&#39;s probably <br/>
easily a third, or more, of the protein she&#39;d need in a day.  In the <br/>
summer I make a twelve ounce smoothie and have half for breakfast <br/>
and the other half for a mid morning snack.   In winter I like a <br/>
warmer breakfast.&lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
Tofu is high in protein.<br/>
There are meat analogues if she has no objection to the taste of <br/>
meat.   Most meat eaters wouldn&#39;t find meat substitutes to taste <br/>
much like meat but as a vegan I find the taste so close I can&#39;t eat <br/>
many of them.  But if she likes them, and my son Dylan likes <br/>
several, they&#39;re loaded with protein.  (Dylan has never eaten meat)  <br/>
Of the meat-substitute-things he likes Celebration Roast and  Boca <br/>
Burger (vegan) <br/>
<br/>
Dylan likes falafel and a mix from Fantastic Foods called Natures <br/>
Burger.<br/>
<br/>
Loma Linda and Worthington Foods make meat substitutes but you might <br/>
have to buy them online.  I don&#39;t use those so don&#39;t know what they <br/>
taste like.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan doesn&#39;t like carrots so sometimes getting a salad in a <br/>
restaurant is hard because lots of salad bars shred carrots into the <br/>
lettuce.    But at home we make glorious salads. <br/>
<br/>
There are different kinds of lettuce so if your daughter doesn&#39;t <br/>
like the slimy paper feel of leaf lettuce maybe she&#39;d like the <br/>
watery crunch of a head lettuce.  Does she like other greens?  We <br/>
make lovely salads from mixed greens and cabbages and other veggies.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan also doesn&#39;t especially care for tomatoes, onions (raw or <br/>
cooked, but onion powder in foods is ok, it&#39;s a texture thing) <br/>
avocado, beets or peppers.  Inspire of that long list we still have <br/>
many salad type  vegetables to choose from. <br/>
<br/>
Some of Dylan&#39;s favorite salad ingredients are lettuce, any kind, <br/>
greens (Swiss chard, spinach, etc.), cabbage, cucumber, black and <br/>
green olives, raw mushrooms, raw broccoli and cauliflower, celery, <br/>
water chestnuts , garbanzo beans, fresh raw peas and zucchini.   <br/>
<br/>
Of cooked vegetables he&#39;ll eat corn on the cob (not now that he has <br/>
braces on his teeth) steamed or sautéed cauliflower and broccoli, <br/>
sautéed zucchini or other summer squash, potatoes,any way, but not <br/>
crazy about mashed, sweet potatoes cut like French fries and baked <br/>
in a hot oven with a drizzle of olive oil, green beans cooked any <br/>
way but his favorite is blanched and then seared in a pan with <br/>
garlic, sesame oil, sesame seeds and soy sauce, yams, cabbage, <br/>
especially bok choy on the grill, jicama, kohlrabi and mushrooms. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not fond of turnips, rutabaga, Brussels sprouts or cooked peas, <br/>
but when I halve fresh Brussels sprouts and grill them with a little <br/>
sesame oil he&#39;ll eat them dipped in course salt.   He&#39;ll eat cooked <br/>
(but not mushy) peas with a little sesame ginger dressing. <br/>
<br/>
He likes nuts of all kinds (he&#39;d have to, living here, &lt;snort&gt;) and <br/>
they&#39;re a good protein source.<br/>
He likes beans and we eat lots of beans and rice.<br/>
He likes hearty breads, rolls and muffins and whole grains have <br/>
protein. <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of recipes online.  There&#39;s a charming, funky, hippy <br/>
cookbook that might especially appeal to your daughter called &quot;The <br/>
Cookbook for People Who Love Animals.&quot;  My copy is just loose pages <br/>
now but when he was little Dylan would look through that book and <br/>
read the little snippets and quotes and then tell me which recipe he <br/>
thought we should try. &lt;g&gt;  Amazon has new and used copies starting <br/>
at $3.90.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-People-Who-Love-">http://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-People-Who-Love-</a><br/>
Animals/dp/0929274180    The book might appeal to your daughter&#39;s <br/>
ethics and give you some ideas.   It&#39;s not the best vegetarian <br/>
cookbook I have, but I&#39;m still fond of it. Buy a used copy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Two books I have used a lot are The American Vegetarian Cookbook, by <br/>
Marilyn Diamond and The Shoshoni Cookbook: Vegetarian Recipes from <br/>
the Shoshoni Yoga Spa.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not hard to get enough protein.  At ten grams per serving (or <br/>
more) of tofu or meat substitute times (lets just say) three meals a <br/>
day you already have thirty plus grams of protein.  Add a side dish <br/>
each meal, a couple glasses of soy milk a day, some nuts for <br/>
snacking  and hearty breads and you would easily meet or exceed the <br/>
recommended amount of protein for a day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-999063681">Hi Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
the only thing that comes immediately to mind is that the eggs we buy or<br/>
hens lay without a rooster around CAN&#39;T become chickens, because they are<br/>
NOT fertilised by a male/rooster. They are just the same as our ovulations,<br/>
except the egg actually comes out and obviously, we don&#39;t ovulate every day,<br/>
like hens! (Has anyone seen the episode of Red Dwarf where they eat &#39;boiled<br/>
chicken&#39;s ovulations&#39;?).<br/>
<br/>
Also, protein can be derived from other sources, as you would know, it&#39;s<br/>
just a bit harder than eating a hunk of cow. So, there are many nuts and<br/>
legumes that contain protein, as well as goat&#39;s milk (you can get it organic,<br/>
humanely produced, or have your own goat/know someone who has one). This<br/>
would go for any humanely produced cheese and eggs, I guess, so your daughter<br/>
would feel okay if she thought the animals were being treated okay in thr<br/>
milking or laying process. It could be a good thing that your daughter becomes<br/>
really informed about her own nutritional needs, as well as animal rights.<br/>
Dark leafy greens are a good source of iron and minerals and are easy to<br/>
grow at home. There are also ethical supplements you could look into.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597193775">Vitamin B-12 can <br/>
be a concern for vegans (who eat no animal products) but this will be <br/>
in the multi-vitamin and added to so many non-animal products such as <br/>
rice/soy milk.<br/>
<br/>
Hey Kendrah and all,<br/>
<br/>
mushrooms are also a source of B12.<br/>
