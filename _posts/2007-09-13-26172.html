it was. &quot;In the garbage.&quot; Her other CD&#39;s? In the garbage. The clothes<br/>

neatly was in the garbage.<br/>

I think it&#39;s REALLY important to understand your goals.<br/>
<br/>
This step-mom will achieve her goal: I&#39;m pretty sure it won&#39;t happen <br/>
again (well, maybe *one* more time)---that her step-daughter will have <br/>
such a messy room.<br/>
<br/>
If the goal is a clean room, that will be considered by *many* to be an <br/>
acceptable route to chose.<br/>
<br/>
If the goal is a kind, respectful, trusting relationship with her <br/>
step-daughter,...ummm.....I think there will be a problem. I doubt that <br/>
damage can *EVER* be repaired.<br/>
<br/>
Children WILL learn---just not necessarily what you think you&#39;re <br/>
teaching them. This step-mom *thought* she was teaching her <br/>
step-daughter a lesson about keeping her room clan. What the child <br/>
*LEARNED* was how to be vindictive, disrespectful, and <br/>
untrustworthy---among other horrible things. This relationship has <br/>
nowhere else to go but DOWN. So sad.<br/>
<br/>
1) What&#39;s the goal?<br/>
2) What&#39;s the REAL lesson being learned?<br/>
3) Would you treat your dearest and best friend like this?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was thinking this, too. It helps me change my perspective when I&#39;m<br/>
in the moment and faced with the immediacy of a situation. It helps to<br/>
take a breath and think about the mom I&#39;m striving to be, what I want<br/>
for my kids and for our relationship Long Term.<br/>
<br/>
What I found really upsetting about the above message was how the girl<br/>
seemed so happy and grateful that her step-mom cleaned her room - she<br/>
even thanked her and I can see how she might have felt that *finally*<br/>
her stepmom was trying to extend a peace offering or be helpful to<br/>
her. I know that when a room is cluttered or really messy it can be<br/>
overwhelming to clean it - where do you start?<br/>
<br/>
So I am imagining the joy and relief the girl felt when she came home<br/>
to a tidy room, and then the betrayal and sadness and anger that must<br/>
have replaced that joy when she learned it was all done in retribution<br/>
and that her belongings were in the garbage and her space had been<br/>
violated in such a mean-spirited way. You&#39;re right, it is so sad. The<br/>
room is clean but the relationship was seriously harmed - if it was<br/>
ever great to begin with, which I doubt considering the way the<br/>
stepmom describes Jessie.<br/>
