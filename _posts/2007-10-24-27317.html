<br/>
 </span></blockquote>unschooling refers to education without a school or school at home <br/>
but the child is in charge of how and where and when they &quot;learn&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling applies this to all areas of life where the <br/>
same &quot;trust&quot; is given to eating/ sleeping/ chores/ manners- in other <br/>
words to ALL of life<br/>
<br/>
SO yes some people unschool by not using textbooks but letting the <br/>
child lead the way but they remain &quot;in charge&quot; of kids so to speak <br/>
and still traditionally parent<br/>
<br/>
unschooling in all areas of life is VERY hand on parenting because <br/>
there is not a list of RULES to follow or break and be punished for <br/>
but chances to learn something. It is working together and finding a <br/>
way to meet EVERYONES needs and wants and not just the parents<br/>
<br/>
It means being REAL and not arbitrary- for instance kids will go to <br/>
slepp when they are tired and not at an 8:00 bedtime. They will eat <br/>
what and when they want to - not just junk but good stuff too. It <br/>
means helping out because they can NOT because someone forces them <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps<br/>

Unschooling is the way they learned to speak English. You did things  <br/>
they enjoyed with them exposed them to new things they might enjoy  <br/>
and they learned English as a side effect. You didn&#39;t -- I assume! --  <br/>
approach learning English with the attitude &quot;They need to do this or  <br/>
they won&#39;t learn how to speak!&quot; English just got learned organically  <br/>
by living life with an engaged mom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696696887">Actually, it means being more involved with the kids, becoming students<br/>
of your children. Rather than simply saying &quot;Okay we&#39;ve done our 2 hours<br/>
of &#39;school&#39; now go play and don&#39;t bother me I&#39;ve got housework to do&quot;<br/>
it&#39;s full on engagement with them, *including* when you&#39;re doing<br/>
housework and errands and when they&#39;re playing videogames or watching<br/>
TV. It&#39;s more akin to what you might term &quot;courtship&quot; - back in The Day<br/>
when you and your beloved were dating, you wanted to know everything<br/>
about that person. You found their likes, dislikes, interests, etc. When<br/>
you noticed in the paper that a concert by their favorite artist is<br/>
coming to your town, you offer to get tickets. They may say yes, great;<br/>
no thanks; or anything in between - it&#39;s an offer with no strings<br/>
attached simply because you noticed something you thought they might<br/>
like. And, you might equally say &quot;Hey I know you like spicy foods. Wanna<br/>
try Thai this week?&quot; and see if it&#39;s a yes, no, maybe or whatever -<br/>
again, no strings, just offering something they might like. And too you<br/>
might also say &quot;There&#39;s a Renaissance Faire next weekend. I love them<br/>
and I&#39;d love to go to this one with you. How about it?&quot; and introduce<br/>
your Beloved to something you enjoy. You don&#39;t even think twice about it<br/>
in that situation. Do the same with your kids - find out what they like<br/>
and look for ways to facilitate that, notice things that are similar and<br/>
offer them, bring into their orbit things that you like.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good heavens no! But there are worlds of possibility in <br/>
between &quot;telling them what to do&quot; and &quot;leaving them to their own <br/>
devices&quot;. Some times my kids don&#39;t need a whole lot from me - <br/>
finding the scissors, making snacks, answering the occasional <br/>
question. Other times they need/want a whole lot of interaction. <br/>
Playing, facilitating, bouncing ideas (or small objects) off me, <br/>
suggesting games or activities or walks or trips or or or.... <br/>
<br/>
In some ways its not all that different from what *any* interested, <br/>
engaged parent does, except that the kids have Vastly more input <br/>
into the process. *Getting* to the point where the kids have that <br/>
much input involves a lot of watching and listening and waiting at <br/>
first - and most especially not placing judgements like <br/>
educational/non-educational or too old/too young for that - or as <br/>
someone else suggested, worthwhile/crappy. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, that reminds me of a suggestion I had for the mom who was <br/>
looking for things to do with herself - do you like to color? I&#39;m <br/>
totally serious! That was one of the &quot;humps&quot; I had to get over, <br/>
myself, that its really okay to do &quot;pointlessly childish activities&quot; <br/>
(to paraphrase some adult or other from my childhood) for my own <br/>
enjoyment. Like coloring. <br/>
<br/>
Getting over that for *myself* helped me step away from making <br/>
judgements against what my kids are interested in doing - and *that* <br/>
freed us all up to communicate more openly about what we want to be <br/>
doing. You wanna watch tv today? Great! You wanna bake six different <br/>
kinds of cake? Alright! Wanna learn to juggle fire? Right on! <br/>
The &quot;really cool&quot; stuff happens *because* we&#39;re open to the <br/>
possibility of days or weeks spent watching reruns of Buffy the <br/>
Vampire Slayer and Go! Diego Go! <br/>

Joyce<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;English just got learned organically by living a life with an engaged <br/>
mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And along with this is understanding that the *more* you talked and <br/>
listened and engaged, the better the learning. The better the <br/>
vocabulary, the better the grammar, the better the comprehension.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving a child is a sterile room and only speaking through a hole in <br/>
the wall in &quot;baby talk&quot; and really bad grammar will not have the same <br/>
&quot;results&quot; as taking him to interesting places and meeting lots of <br/>
chatty people and watching movies with subtitles and rhyming and <br/>
playing words games and speaking with silly accents and talking about <br/>
why things sound/mean certain ways.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about &quot;teaching&quot; English---it&#39;s about USING it. Playing with <br/>
it. Engaging in it.<br/>
<br/>
In school, children are &quot;taught&quot; foreign languages the same way <br/>
teachers &quot;teach&quot; everything else: sterile and with no context. *You* <br/>
may have been taught a foreign language that way! How much do you <br/>
remember?<br/>
<br/>
Do any of you actually speak and understand a second language? How did <br/>
you learn *that*? With lectures and textbooks and worksheets and <br/>
quizzes?<br/>
<br/>
The best way to learn a second language is the same way you learned the <br/>
first! By being surrounded by others who speak that language. By asking <br/>
simple questions and having them answered in that language. By starting <br/>
with small, simple nouns (juice, cookie, store,...beer &lt;g&gt;) and <br/>
gradually adding verbs (drink, go, want, find, look) and then adding <br/>
adverbs and adjectives. Slowly making full sentences that make more and <br/>
more sense. Hearing different words in different contexts and making <br/>
those connections. Making mistakes and learning from them with no major <br/>
setbacks or embarassments because your &quot;guide&quot; was right there helping <br/>
you navigate the language.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works the same way. It&#39;s not about&quot; teaching&quot; things out of <br/>
context because he *might* need them some day or about dropping a ten <br/>
year old in Rome, Italy and saying, &quot;Go learn Italian!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about BEing with him and helping him find his way. About being <br/>
WITH him and helping him navigate the world. LOTS of input and <br/>
assistance.<br/>

for my hubby to use - don&#39;t remember where I ordered from - the <br/>
pages were translucent, kind of like baking parchment but not <br/>
exactly the same. It was a book of Celtic type patterns (there were <br/>
other pattern sets too, I knew he&#39;d like the Celtic patterns) and he <br/>
colored them in with some really nice markers that came with it and <br/>
I have them hanging in my office windows - need to remove them now <br/>
because they&#39;re all faded from a couple years of sunlight but when <br/>
they were fresh and crisp, they were awesome!<br/>
