<br/>
Reading and spelling are two different skills.<br/>
<br/>
I would find books that have a lot of repetition like &quot;Is your mama a llama?&quot; and when you are reading, you can show him what a word is and then when you are reading and you get to that word, point, pause and let him say it.<br/>
<br/>
As he knows more and more words, you will do more pointing and he will do more reading.  <br/>
<br/>
You can also play rhyming games.  <br/>
<br/>
Put the alphabet on little cards and let him play around changing the first letter of words to see what they say.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, pay attention to his cues and if he wants to stop, by all means, stop.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307218765">*** He wants me to TEACH him to read. I don&#39;t know how. ***<br/>
<br/>
When Sam showed desire to read, he&#39;d be all for sitting down with me for about half an hour and reading with him, helping him to read, and then he&#39;d be up and off and living his life as joyfully as before the request to learn to read...<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;d use games and post-it notes (play with letters and words) and we read all the time together...<br/>
<br/>
But nothing really mattered because he just wasn&#39;t *ready* to read, even though the desire was there once in awhile.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 10 1/2 now and he&#39;s been *just* picking up reading connections lately.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s happened slowly and over a long period of time...but he makes more and more connections every single day.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, there are things you can do...but I think it&#39;s also important to let him know that sometimes it doesn&#39;t happen just because you WANT it to happen...sometimes it still takes a while for it all to *click* and *connect*.<br/>
<br/>
We have the *Bob* books and we love those.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0439145449/104-5752708-4457542?v=glance">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0439145449/104-5752708-4457542?v=glance</a> <br/>
<br/>
We actually were able to make fun of them while reading their simple stories...and that helped Sam to enjoy them more! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And post-it notes are invaluable.  I wrote letters on them and Sam played around with them, moving the letters around.<br/>
<br/>
I also took his favorite words and wrote them on 3 X 5 cards, with illustrations surrounding the word.  For example, Sam loves the word *Tsunami* so I wrote it on a card with a big wave behind it.  Any word that he was drawn to, I would draw like this and hang them up.  Just for him to *see*, not necessarily *learn right then how to read or spell it*.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I put a geometry school poster in the bathroom because I thought it was cool and something interesting to look at...Sam walked out of the bathroom one day saying over and over again, &quot;Parallelogram...Parallelogram...Parallelogram...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No one ever told him that&#39;s what that poster said.<br/>
<br/>
***he&#39;s done with them in like 2 min and then tells me he wants <br/>
math problems, not math easys.***<br/>
<br/>
LOL!  My Jake has always been drawn to challenging mind games...he loves things like *Mensa* cards for kids.  We&#39;ve checked out a lot of *mind-bending* books from the library, too, and he&#39;s enjoyed those.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe those would be more challenging for your son instead of math *problems*.  Because if he KNOWS how to do them, then they&#39;re going to be *math easy&#39;s*...and if he doesn&#39;t know how to do them, is he willing to have you show him how to do them?<br/>
<br/>
With mind-bending books and cards and puzzles, he can stretch his mind within his own comfort level, and you could join him in coming up with answers together.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion...<br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a series of &quot;Step Into Reading&quot; books that have pictures instead of words for some of the words.  So  sentence might read &quot;One day the (picture of the sun) was just waking up when the (picture of a rooster) decided that he didn&#39;t want to crow&quot;  You read with the child and point to the words as you read and they fill in the picture words.  When my kids were wanting to know *how* to read I just started putting labels on everything.  We had chairs, tables, refrigerator, floor, wall, door, window all labeled.  I love sight words.  They can figure out the rest later.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Games for Reading&quot; by Peggy Kaye. Should be in the library. &quot;How to <br/>
Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons&quot; is just AWFUL, in my <br/>
not-so-humble-opinion. Drudgery, boring, lifeless, one-size-fits-all, <br/>
and if I&#39;d imposed that on my kids I cannot imagine how they&#39;d have <br/>
become the voracious readers they are today.<br/>
<br/>
Create a print-rich environment - in many more ways than just reading <br/>
together. But, do pick some books that he might pick up the reading in, <br/>
quickly, like Hop on Pop, so that he has a chance at it.<br/>
<br/>
A whole little series of books by Patty Wolcott are funny, and have <br/>
lots of repetition and are rhythmic - my kids learned to recognize big <br/>
words, like &quot;Marvelous&quot; and that felt great to them.  (Marvelous Mud <br/>
Washing Machine - our favorite, along with the Cake Book)<br/>
<br/>
His own &quot;Word Box.&quot; A cool box - you ask him, &quot;What words do you want <br/>
to learn to read?&quot; You write those words carefully on an index card. He <br/>
keeps his words in his box. When HE wants to practice his reading, he <br/>
pulls the box out and goes over the words, asking you if he forgets <br/>
any. It is okay if the words are dinosaur and alligator and umbrella. <br/>
They don&#39;t have to be &quot;beginning&quot; reading words.<br/>
<br/>
Rhyming games - lots of them. We played in the car a lot - but you <br/>
could do it to satisfy his desire for his reading lessons. You say <br/>
&quot;SAM&quot; and he responds with &quot;HAM&quot; and then you say &quot;CLAM&quot; and he says <br/>
&quot;SPAM&quot; and so on - trying to go as long as you can. Start with the <br/>
short &quot;a&quot; sound and when you&#39;ve exhausted all your ideas for that move <br/>
on to other short vowels sounds.<br/>
<br/>
Learn the alphabet song with sounds instead of letter names. &quot;Ah&quot;, <br/>
&quot;Beh&quot;, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Magnetic letters on the refrigerator - there are some that have shapes <br/>
- like a farmer on a tractor - in two parts with &quot;F A&quot; on one part and <br/>
&quot;R M&quot; on the other half.<br/>
<br/>
And so on -- there are a million ways to &quot;teach reading&quot; - but don&#39;t <br/>
take over from him, find ways to support his learning, not to impose it <br/>
on him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;While i&#39;m asking...Jaiden loves math, and everyday asks me to give<br/>
him a page of math problems. I spend 10-15min trying to think up good<br/>
ones, he&#39;s done with them in like 2 min and then tells me he wants<br/>
math problems, not math easys. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
This cracks me up. Rosie, not too long ago, got irritated with me <br/>
because I was explaining something to her that she&#39;d asked about and <br/>
she wanted practice problems to try it out, but the ones I gave her <br/>
were too easy. She very strongly said, &quot;Mom, please CHALLENGE me, just <br/>
CHALLENGE me, that&#39;s all I ask.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Roxana was here and heard her and said, &quot;Hey, Mom, I bet you wish you <br/>
had THAT on tape for your math talks, huh?&quot; &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you google &quot;math worksheets creation&quot; I think you&#39;ll find sites that <br/>
do that. There is no shortage of them - I have to weed through them, <br/>
seems like, when I&#39;m looking for math sites with something else besides <br/>
worksheets.<br/>

<br/>
One thing you could do would be to encourage writing. I think a lot <br/>
of kids come to reading through writing, which is the opposite way <br/>
that most schools teach it. I know both of my kids wrote fluently <br/>
before they could read much, they just asked me how to spell things. <br/>
After awhile of spelling the same words the same way (like &quot;the&quot;), <br/>
they began to recognize these words when they saw them on the page. <br/>
My kids both love to write, but can&#39;t really sustain it for very <br/>
long, so they often dictate their longer stories to me and then they <br/>
write/draw a cover page.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I really love all the invented spelling that they come up with <br/>
when they&#39;re first starting. My son had a sign he made for the door <br/>
of his room that said &quot;Konstwukchen Goen On&quot; (Construction Going On). <br/>
That one was a keeper for sure!<br/>

&gt; This site was recently mentioned for being good for math worksheets,<br/>
&gt; which both of my kids also adore, for some reason :-)<br/>
