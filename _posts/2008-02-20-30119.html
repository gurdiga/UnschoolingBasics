<div id="ygrps-yiv-146520829">My family and I might be in Philadelphia for the weekend of March 14,<br/>
15, 16.  My boys are 9 and 3.  My husband will be tied up with a<br/>
tournament most of the day on Saturday.  Any suggestions for us? <br/>
Places to visit?  We&#39;ve never been to Philly!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Oooh, The Franklin Institute, hands down. It&#39;s 3 stories of hands-on, <br/>
interactive, many high-energy science oriented exhibits. Plus a <br/>
planetarium and an I-Max. I *highly* recommend it.<br/>

<br/>
Also if you have the time and the $ to splurge, 1/2 block away is The <br/>
Academy of Natural Sciences, which is kinda lame as a museum, but has an <br/>
*amazing* butterfly room. The other stuff is okay.<br/>
<br/>
And be sure to have a cheese steak for lunch while you&#39;re there!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710742966">There&#39;s also the Please Touch Museum, though more geared towards your<br/>
younger child.  We enjoyed Please Touch a lot when my kids were smaller.  I<br/>
second the recommendation of the Franklin Institute.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912480792">Ooo....I don&#39;t know about the 3 yo, but the 9 yo would LOVE The Mütter  <br/>
Museum at the College of Physicians -- also known as the Museum of Medical  <br/>
Oddities (anyone Daria fans?)<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s REALLY cool... we expected to have a very brief visit, but we LOVED  it. <br/>
 I suppose we might be weird.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-733051976">One of my favorite Fresh Air episodes was when Terry Gross interviewed<br/>
the director of the Mutter Museum. I had never heard of it before that<br/>
show. You can hear it here:<br/>

while there, I got a behind the scenes tour of some of their <br/>
collections. Some very weird stuff indeed. One of the cool things I saw <br/>
there was a mummified bound-foot from a Chinese woman.<br/>
