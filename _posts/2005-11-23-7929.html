<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630757989">Thanks everyone for putting things into perspective! You&#39;ve given me<br/>
great ideas and I&#39;ve been able to use them and see them work!  <br/>
<br/>
hi Alex!!!  I&#39;m so sorry for your loss, but happy to hear that you&#39;re<br/>
expecting again. It would be great to get together with you again.  I<br/>
 helped start a local homeschool group this year, real laid-back and<br/>
just for the kids to make friends and have fun, and would love to have<br/>
another unschooler around! Let me know if you&#39;re interested, <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:crissyhall@...">crissyhall@...</a>   I can&#39;t believe your son isn&#39;t 4 yet, I thought<br/>
he was older than Nate :)<br/>
<br/>
I love the conversations too. And the best part is not necessary<br/>
having the answer to the questions, but just the interests it <br/>
<br/>
sparks.  I remember a quick trip to Target and catching an American<br/>
Girl book from falling out of the van sparked a  <br/>
<br/>
conversation about WWII, & the Civil War, which lead to human rights,<br/>
and wonderiing why woman don&#39;t have equal <br/>
<br/>
rights!!! My oldest dd and I just couldn&#39;t fathom why women make up<br/>
over 50% of the population but we couldn&#39;t pass the <br/>
<br/>
ERA???  Then I shared our conversation with someone who was old enough<br/>
to vote in the 70s and found out that many <br/>
<br/>
women were frightened of having to share public bathrooms and being<br/>
forced to fight in wars. Amazing!  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t always &quot;see&quot; learning happening in my kids, but I see it in<br/>
myself so I trust it is working the same wonderful way with <br/>
<br/>
them.  Wars and timelines were sooo boring to me in school and now<br/>
after watching the TV show &quot;Rome&quot; (which I&#39;m sure <br/>
<br/>
many, many people find as a totally unredeeming waste of time full of<br/>
violence and sex)  has sparked an interest in history <br/>
<br/>
and religions.  My dh and I want to find a really good book about the<br/>
Roman empire and find out more about Titus Pullo <br/>
<br/>
and Lucius Vorianus (sp?), how much was their story embellished and<br/>
how much was true :) And when did different <br/>
<br/>
religions start in comparison to world events. Oh and what is the<br/>
Buddism and Hinduism.... And, and, and...... :)<br/>
<br/>
I also HATE science and have no interest in writiing computer code<br/>
(even though according to tests they are my <br/>
<br/>
stregthens???) until.... my dh wanted &quot;scientific&quot; proof and<br/>
documentation that unschooling works. And after listening to <br/>
<br/>
Pam&#39;s speech that there is  a study about the brain and how learning<br/>
works (thanks Pam!),  I&#39;m now looking forward to <br/>
<br/>
looking up a scientific study and want to learn to write code so I can<br/>
have a blog!!!   <br/>
<br/>
Anastasia, my dh was like your dh and he happened to really question<br/>
unschooling one day when I was PMSing, not a <br/>
<br/>
good time for me to be the most persuasive and unemotional! And he<br/>
wanted proof; studies on unschooling and <br/>
<br/>
unschooled kids that were sucessful, not just antidotal evidence. Ha!<br/>
He&#39;s knew he was asking for the impossible!  Luckily <br/>
<br/>
I was able to quote some smart woman from here (can&#39;t remember who?)<br/>
that he would have to trust me because I believe <br/>
<br/>
in it. I also remember him telling me about working with people from a<br/>
country well esteemed for education  and while they <br/>
<br/>
could quickly quote a fact from the top of their head (so it took him<br/>
2 extra minutes to look it up ;),  they couldn&#39;t use the <br/>
<br/>
information to creatively solve a problem.  We want our kids to be<br/>
creative, curious, passionate, problem solvers that love <br/>
<br/>
learning not kids crushed and just do what they are told.  He said  I<br/>
was right and that he would have to trust me, but it <br/>
<br/>
would be helpful to him to have some of the highlights pointed out.  I<br/>
can do that!  He saw the kids at the end of the day when they were<br/>
winding down and missed out on a lot of the conversations, questions,<br/>
passions, and fun places we had been to.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, &quot;fan of obsessions&quot;  sounds like a good book title:)<br/>
<br/>
Question: I understand &quot;Principles vs Rules&quot; and I definitely agree<br/>
that discipline doesn&#39;t mean punishment, but I&#39;m struggling with what<br/>
to do when a principle isn&#39;t being followed? What do you do when a<br/>
child is being hurtful even after it has been clearly stated that they<br/>
are being hurtful?  Is finding out what the cause is and coming up<br/>
with other options enough???  What do you do when a child doesn&#39;t have<br/>
the language skills to say what&#39;s going on?  <br/>
