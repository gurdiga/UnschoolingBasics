It differs from state to state, and college to college but you can  <br/>
check out community colleges. They will probably say juniors and  <br/>
seniors can take courses but it may not be a rule. My daughter has  <br/>
been sitting in on the college math classes my husband teaches since  <br/>
she was 14.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433357244">I was just so hoping for him that he&#39;d just relax for awhile, which he<br/>
and his sister have been doing for several weeks now, without knowing<br/>
why they were not being asked to do schoolwork.  I&#39;ll check out the<br/>
local college here and see if he could sit in on some classes though<br/>
or something, IF he wants to.  I already made sure to tell him that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t &#39;need&#39; to do this there is plenty of time for college later if<br/>
he wants and I made sure to let him know not to feel bad if we bought<br/>
the book and he ends up not using it.  I said, if you want, we can<br/>
just use is it for ideas.  <br/>

I believe) once he is 13.  He does NOT need a GED to take these classes.<br/>
I&#39;ll get more information for you on it if you want.  Mary Elayne&#39;s<br/>
gymnastics coaches are in this program. The biggest complaint that I hear<br/>
from them is that they can&#39;t take summer classes.  UWF also has an<br/>
&quot;accelerated program&quot; for high school aged kids who want to take college<br/>
classes, but the requirements are a little stiffer.  With the PJC program<br/>
they can earn their AA while still not graduated from high school and then<br/>
transfer to UWF as a Junior when they complete the program (usually takes 4<br/>
years) so they are Juniors when other kids their age are just Freshmen.<br/>
Emily is considering doing this in the fall.<br/>

*************************<br/>
Cool!  My son was a 14 year old college student -- he had just turned  14 and <br/>
took a class at Harvard Extension, with mostly grad students. He loved  it, <br/>
and did well. He was the student who participated most in class. For Julian,  <br/>
it helped him get rid of any school residual feelings about not being smart  <br/>
enough.<br/>
 <br/>
He doesn&#39;t have to get a GED to do it. There might be a college nearby he  <br/>
can take a class, or he could take classes online. Just like there&#39;s no rush,  <br/>
there&#39;s also no need to wait if there&#39;s stuff he wants to do. I would strongly  <br/>
suggest that he take a class in something he&#39;s really excited about, rather <br/>
than  a &quot;101&quot; sort of class. Even if it seems hard at first (Julian&#39;s first <br/>
class was  on Darwin and Society, with lots of papers and TONS of reading), it&#39;ll <br/>
come  easier than a class that feels boring.<br/>
 <br/>
If he has any questions or ideas, he&#39;s welcome to e-mail me or Julian. Let  <br/>
me know.<br/>

available where we live :)  If you were in Saskatchewan or Albuquerque I<br/>
would probably not reply much about college.  Although if you were asking<br/>
about the SCA and lived in either of those place I would probably give you<br/>
some names of people to look up :)<br/>
