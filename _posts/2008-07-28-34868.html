<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052947319">Hi everyone,<br/>
First-time poster.  I was wondering what strategies any of you might<br/>
like to pass on in terms of keeping your house tidy in your<br/>
unschooling world.  I have two boys - 5 and almost 3 - and I have to<br/>
say the state of the house is really bugging me.  We spend anywhere<br/>
from 30 minutes to an hour every evening tidying up (I&#39;m not talking<br/>
about cleaning, just picking up), and what happens a lot is I start<br/>
snapping at the kids (which I really don&#39;t like, because I&#39;m normally<br/>
pretty laid back and mellow), but it&#39;s usually just me putting<br/>
everything away, while they move one block at a time using a tiny lego<br/>
wheelbarrow to push it across the floor:)<br/>
We only pick up once a day, but still, it&#39;s starting to really<br/>
irritate me.  I probably am a perfectionist in that I find I just feel<br/>
a lot better and my mind feels clearer when I am not looking out on a<br/>
lot of clutter (not to mention the injured feet after stepping on the<br/>
umpteenth pointy block in the kitchen floor) Interested to know any<br/>
strategies you all have either practical in terms of tidying, or<br/>
mental (i.e., coping strategies for me).<br/>
Thanks!</div>

i also feel uncomfortable when the house gets really messy. it makes me feel confused more than anything, but i understand that crabby feeling.<br/>
i think waiting until the end of the end of the day might be adding to your crankiness. it&#39;s hard to clean up a whole lot of stuff after hours and hours of playing. maybe try to put away the things everyone is really and truly done with when they finish with them. i usually clean up while my son has something to snack on. the mess is almost always in the living room and kitchen, so he&#39;s nearby and sometimes helps. my daughter does some of the cleaning, too, because i&#39;ve offered her money in exchange for some household help. i imagine this is a loaded topic- the money for help thing- but it works. she gets a little spending money, i get a little help. <br/>
we also keep things in the room where we use them, for the most part. there are toys in the living room in baskets, they are easy to just toss in when we finish with them. i used to prefer the toys in the other room but we never went into the living room until we put the fun stuff in there, and it seemed to make clean up harder to put them in separate rooms. <br/>
finally, if you feel seriously overwhelmed, you can either get rid of, or hide, some stuff. i have never been able to part with anything, but i have an enormous attic which i admit, is chaotic. i don&#39;t worry about that too much, because i remember as a child having a huge attic full of mysterious stuff, and it was wonderful. do you have a space where you can put some things that are not being used often? or you can circulate the toys, having some stuff out for a month or so and then switching. <br/>
i cleared out most of my own stuff to make room for the kids. i figure in five or so years, i&#39;ll wish i had legos and trains underfoot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083574231">Hi First-Time Poster,<br/>
<br/>
This is my first post as well. I&#39;m venturing out of lurkdom because I could <br/>
have written your post myself -- a few months ago, before this unschooling <br/>
journey we started.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a 5 and (almost) 3 yo, both boys. So I can relate.<br/>
<br/>
I think the first thing to do is take a big, deep, breath, let it out, and <br/>
relax. I can feel the tension through the words in your post. I know <br/>
*exactly* what you mean when you say the mess drives you crazy, but it&#39;s <br/>
only stuff: Start trying to let go of that need to have it all tidy and neat <br/>
as a button. Remember what the toys all over the place represent: Your boys <br/>
growing, loving life, learning, playing with each other, finding value in <br/>
all the big and small parts of this great world, being HAPPY!<br/>
<br/>
And slowly, consciously change the little voice in your head: When you see <br/>
the mess, think &quot;This is the outcome of a wonderful, positive, loving day <br/>
that my boys and I (and whoever else) shared together! I am so greatful for <br/>
this wonderful mess! In fact, I LOVE it! I embrace it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And when you do clean toys up, realize it&#39;s because *you* don&#39;t like the <br/>
&quot;mess&quot; (what I prefer to call creative output) -- not because they don&#39;t <br/>
like it. You are cleaning it up for your *own* sake. So don&#39;t expect them to <br/>
naturally want to do it. And if they want to put one Lego away at a time - <br/>
remember, that is what makes sense to them. That is what is bringing them <br/>
joy in tidying up. What if someone thought *your* method of putting toys <br/>
away was inefficient and useless? Would that be a positive experience for <br/>
you, and would it make you want to tidy up all the time?<br/>
<br/>
In addition, here&#39;s another though: Many of us are programmed to think <br/>
&quot;Cleaning up is such a chore!&quot; But really - isn&#39;t is sometimes fun? Kind of <br/>
like playing house when you were a kid? I dig into that inner child of mine <br/>
whenever possible when I&#39;m doing housework. I haven&#39;t solved the riddle of <br/>
getting the whole house cleaned up at one time (usually sections here and <br/>
there..), and I still dream (sometimes out loud!) of the perfect &quot;system&quot; <br/>
that joyfully keeps all the stuff (and laundry and groceries) flowing and in <br/>
order (sort of), but I keep it all in perspective. It&#39;s only stuff; and I am <br/>
a better person when I rise above my &quot;need for organization&quot; and can let go.<br/>
<br/>
(There&#39;s a great Dayna Martin video on this - it&#39;s where I got many of these <br/>
ideas from: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr7U7wXmBcA)">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr7U7wXmBcA)</a><br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps and makes sense.<br/>

you will understand what we&#39;re saying. It&#39;ll be sooo clear then.<br/>

You can *choose* to hear us now though. &lt;BWG&gt; And before too long, <br/>
folding those tee-niney little t-shirts will be a very distant---and <br/>
sweet---memory. And when you find a stray Lego under the dresser that <br/>
hasn&#39;t been moved for years, you&#39;ll smile. I promise. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Laundry and dirty dishes will *always* be there. Mine still are. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
But those children will *never* be five and three again. I guarantee <br/>
that!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077423526">Not that this helps much...it&#39;s just one of the options.  My hubby wrote<br/>
about the &#39;mess&#39; in this post:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://freeboysdad.blogspot.com/2008/06/help-wanted.html">http://freeboysdad.blogspot.com/2008/06/help-wanted.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I think it was Meredith who wrote that basically her home was a canvas.  She<br/>
sees it as her responsibility to provide her kids with a clean one to create<br/>
on.  This helps me a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I know, for me, Kade would suddenly become interested in the exact thing I<br/>
was putting away.  So, out it would come even before I finished putting it<br/>
back.  Then I&#39;d try to move onto another thing...and he would come over to<br/>
play with it.  This went on and on.  We&#39;d travel around the house and do<br/>
this &#39;dance&#39;.  I had a choice.  I could get upset, or I could laugh.  My<br/>
house is a mess.  It takes at least 2 hours to pick up and put everything<br/>
away (and I don&#39;t do it all, every day) and we only have 1300 sq ft of<br/>
&#39;play&#39; space!  My boys LOVE to create and explore.  This means I love to<br/>
create and explore, too.  In a few years, their toys will be different and<br/>
not on the living room floor.  In a few years, they will be out and about<br/>
with their play.  Time spent with them is vital to their learning.  A messy<br/>
house, therefore, is vital to my allowing them to learn.  I have baskets<br/>
(large ones) in every room.  As I go by, I can now add things to them<br/>
(without a little guy taking them out as I&#39;m putting them in) and our home<br/>
has many paths during the day.  When they start to wind down, I pick stuff<br/>
up as I have energy to do so.  With my hubby home most weekends, I get more<br/>
time to flit around.<br/>
<br/>
3 and 5 is young.  In a few short years, you will have the opportunity to<br/>
clean to your hearts content...and have everything exactly where you want<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538199200">My kids do chores.  (I&#39;ve never posted here before because I have seen how<br/>
quickly you attack people who post certain unlikeable ideas, so I&#39;m a bit<br/>
scared to continue, but chores work for us.)  I don&#39;t want the kids to grow<br/>
up feeling like they have a free pass to destroy the place and follow their<br/>
every whim while I have to go behind them with a shovel and a spray<br/>
bottle!!  It doesn&#39;t take that long when we all help, and I tell them it&#39;s<br/>
part of living with other people.  I don&#39;t want to pick up my stinky old<br/>
socks any more than they do, but I do it as a courtesy to them to keep the<br/>
house livable.  They keep the toys and whatnot picked up as a courtesy to me<br/>
for cooking their food, driving them places, and a million other things they<br/>
need me for.  They each have different chores (that they chose) and we do<br/>
them right after breakfast.  I clean up at the same time so we&#39;re all in it<br/>
together.  I even ask the baby  (16 mo) to carry her breakfast bowl to the<br/>
kitchen.  She loves it!  The other two (6 and 4) aren&#39;t thrilled, but they<br/>
do appreciate the expediency of having a kitchen ready for that impromptu<br/>
baking experiment, or a dining room table cleared of crumbs and ready for<br/>
play dough, and the most important - knowing where their shoes are so they<br/>
can head for the woods.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; First-time poster. I was wondering what strategies any of you might<br/>
&gt; like to pass on in terms of keeping your house tidy in your<br/>
&gt; unschooling world. I have two boys - 5 and almost 3 - and I have to<br/>
&gt; say the state of the house is really bugging me. We spend anywhere<br/>
&gt; from 30 minutes to an hour every evening tidying up (I&#39;m not talking<br/>
&gt; about cleaning, just picking up), and what happens a lot is I start<br/>
&gt; snapping at the kids (which I really don&#39;t like, because I&#39;m normally<br/>
&gt; pretty laid back and mellow), but it&#39;s usually just me putting<br/>
&gt; everything away, while they move one block at a time using a tiny lego<br/>
&gt; wheelbarrow to push it across the floor:)<br/>
&gt; We only pick up once a day, but still, it&#39;s starting to really<br/>
&gt; irritate me. I probably am a perfectionist in that I find I just feel<br/>
&gt; a lot better and my mind feels clearer when I am not looking out on a<br/>
&gt; lot of clutter (not to mention the injured feet after stepping on the<br/>
&gt; umpteenth pointy block in the kitchen floor) Interested to know any<br/>
&gt; strategies you all have either practical in terms of tidying, or<br/>
&gt; mental (i.e., coping strategies for me).<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

their relationship with their kids. It&#39;s not attacking. I&#39;ve *seen*<br/>
attacking on some of the other lists, and it is not pretty. It&#39;s why<br/>
I&#39;m not a member on some of the other lists.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen some strong knee-jerk reactions to some things people have<br/>
said, and to me, it seemed harsher than necessary - but through the<br/>
ensuing conversation, things get cleared up.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your willingness to post!<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-862058105">We don&#39;t buy much stuff.  We exchange toys from a closet rather than have them all out.  We put things away so the dog doesn&#39;t lie on them.  <br/>
<br/>
I follow Flylady&#39;s routines loosley, and the important messages I took away are:<br/>
<br/>
1.  If it matters to you, do it yourself.  Don&#39;t mope because no one else thinks it is important and won&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
2.  If you do it, they will follow.  Model the behavior or actions, and the family may pick up on it...or not.<br/>
<br/>
3.  You can accomplish a lot in 15 minutes a day.<br/>
<br/>
We have allergies, fleas, and roaches (yay, FL) so keeping the house tidy is important to me for the health of the family.  I keep those ideas in mind when doing housework, and find my house generally tidy by doing about 15-30 minutes a day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830025927">&quot;Keeping&quot; my house tidy just doesn&#39;t happen around here.  Nothing is all that consistent so that I have that perfect house all of the time.  However, when I really have a need for a clean and tidy house I can get pretty creative and I enjoy the creative process of planning how to do it.  I don&#39;t usually stick to one routine because it gets boring for me.  Here are a few suggestions that helped me:<br/>
<br/>
1)  I need adrenaline or excitement to get into the mood for cleaning, etc.  Sometimes I plan to have someone over just to keep the excitement high, or I try to &quot;Surprise&quot; my husband with a really clean house, or I play cleaning games with the kids.  One of my kids (I have 3 and 5 yo boys and I&#39;m 34 weeks pregnant with another boy) really likes to play I spy.  I usually spy something wrong with a room and he puts everything back where it belongs.  Once everything is back where it belongs, I tell him what the secret item was and if he put it away.  Then he does the same thing in a room that I&#39;m cleaning.  My 3yo doesn&#39;t like to do it very much if his older brother is playing too because then he thinks that he lost.<br/>
<br/>
2)  If I have a lot of house work to do and my kids are bored, I play while I&#39;m cleaning.  I turn into some character and the silliness begins.  We have pretended that our house is a hotel and we are getting ready for a king and queen to come visit.  I play the bossy head maid and my son loves to be the irresponsible janitor.  We have also made giant piles of laundry to jump in and throw around.  Then the kids usually sort it ALL for me.  My 3 yo loves to clean with me.  He has his own cleaning cart (a kid&#39;s shopping cart) complete with vinegar and water spray bottles, baking soda (for scrubbing), rags, dusters, trash bags tied on the sides, and a bucket and small mop.  He loves to wet his hands pour baking soda on them and scrub my shower.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Another thing I like to do is make a BIGGER mess.  For example, if a room is really bugging me, I like to start from scratch and reorganize or rearrange.  My kids love this!  And my oldest asks for days if we can redo the house.  I recently emptied my entire pantry onto the kitchen table and putting it all back took all day, but then I had a really neat pantry.  The kids stayed busy checking out all of the food that they usually don&#39;t see and then they loved helping me decide how to organize it all back on the shelves.  My oldest helped me until the very end.<br/>
<br/>
4)  Another thing that plays into the adrenaline thing for me is to set a timer.  When the kids ask why I&#39;m moving so fast, I tell them and sometimes they want to get in on the fun.  I usually say something like:  I&#39;m trying to get this room picked up in 3 minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
5)  Baskets are great for a quick tidy.  I don&#39;t like to sort the baskets, but I just stick them in the guest room or closet and my husband doesn&#39;t mind doing some quick sorts once in a while.  My husband is much better at picking up and I&#39;m much better at deep cleaning so that&#39;s usually how things get done around here.<br/>
<br/>
6)  I am very comfortable in a mess and I think that helps to keep things low stress.  However, I think we all function better when things are much more tidy, so that&#39;s the way I try to keep things.<br/>
<br/>
7)  Try to think about how your kids play and how the &quot;mess&quot; is created.  For example, my boys love to play legos, but if they played with them all over the floor I&#39;d be picking them up for hours.  We use a play table (large train table with drawers under) for their legos.  This way they never have to pick them up.  It&#39;s an ongoing creative process.  Ask yourself &quot;What is making the mess?&quot;  &quot;How can I make things easier on myself?&quot;  Get creative.  My boys used to leave their dress up clothes all over the house until I created a special &quot;dressing room&quot; in one of our closets.  We have a family closet for all of our clothes, so that has freed up some other closets and those are great places to make &quot;messes&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
8)  Use more &quot;grown up&quot; things for play.  For example, we used to have all kinds of art supplies for the kids but they always wanted to use my husband&#39;s stuff.  We have gotten rid of all of the &quot;kid&quot; art stuff and have simplified our art supplies.  Another example of this is tools.  My 3yo loves tools.  He had a bunch of fake tools, but they would get scattered all over the house.  I have started helping him use adult tools instead and he has REALLY enjoyed this!  He likes to hammer nails into boxes or even wood.  <br/>
<br/>
9)  Consider the length of time that your kids stay interested in a toy.  Is it a toy that they just dig out, look at it for a second and throw it aside?  I think that it&#39;s important for kids to &quot;check out&quot; toys, but we usually do this at toy stores, garage sales, and other kid&#39;s houses.  I don&#39;t keep things that don&#39;t get played with.  If they play with their stuffed animals once a month for a long and fun play time, then I&#39;d keep a basket of them in the top of the closet for when they&#39;re ready for them.  But if they have a couple of stuffed animals that they just throw aside to get to other toys, I&#39;d get rid of them.  My friends and I love to have swap playdates, where everyone brings a bag of toys to trade.  Only having toys around that your kids love really seems to help with the &quot;mess&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that you need to get creative to keep things tidy without all of the negative feelings and you have to practice making and enjoying messes with your children.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes!<br/>
Jeanette<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Keeping your house tidy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi everyone,<br/>
First-time poster.  I was wondering what strategies any of you might<br/>
like to pass on in terms of keeping your house tidy in your<br/>
unschooling world.  I have two boys - 5 and almost 3 - and I have to<br/>
say the state of the house is really bugging me.  We spend anywhere<br/>
from 30 minutes to an hour every evening tidying up (I&#39;m not talking<br/>
about cleaning, just picking up), and what happens a lot is I start<br/>
snapping at the kids (which I really don&#39;t like, because I&#39;m normally<br/>
pretty laid back and mellow), but it&#39;s usually just me putting<br/>
everything away, while they move one block at a time using a tiny lego<br/>
wheelbarrow to push it across the floor:)<br/>
We only pick up once a day, but still, it&#39;s starting to really<br/>
irritate me.  I probably am a perfectionist in that I find I just feel<br/>
a lot better and my mind feels clearer when I am not looking out on a<br/>
lot of clutter (not to mention the injured feet after stepping on the<br/>
umpteenth pointy block in the kitchen floor) Interested to know any<br/>
strategies you all have either practical in terms of tidying, or<br/>
mental (i.e., coping strategies for me).<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

family, we&#39;ve decided that chores makes the house run smoothly for all of<br/>
us.  The other mom asked the question about how to keep it all clean and I<br/>

unschoolers come in a rainbow of degrees and you have to accept<br/>
that.  Letting little kids stay up all hours of the night and doing all the<br/>

&quot;They keep the toys and whatnot picked up as a courtesy to me<br/>
for cooking their food, driving them places, and a million other things they<br/>
need me for.&quot;<br/>
Firstly, I must say I&#39;m not attacking, I&#39;m discussing.  Please see it as<br/>
such.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have my kids do chores.  They help me pick up when they wish to.  My<br/>
youngest will usually only do so if he sees I&#39;m doing it to enable our play<br/>
to get bigger.  I don&#39;t require it.  I do ask for help sometimes and<br/>
sometimes they help.  I also look at it as a skill they already have<br/>
mastered and don&#39;t wish to practice right now (both boys know how to pick up<br/>
and put things away) the same for dishes and laundry and dusting and<br/>
cleaning.  I do acknowledge when they do something that is helpful (Kade<br/>
even mopped the kitchen floor for me the other day all on his own<br/>
volition!).  I express my appreciation.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to the quote.  My question is: what are you going to have to do &quot;as<br/>
a courtesy&quot; to them when they cook for you (or themselves for that matter),<br/>
drive for you and do the million things that you&#39;ve seen as &#39;needs from<br/>
you&#39;?  Do you keep tally with your Sig Other, too?  Is there a tally of who<br/>
does what?  Should there be?  I personally say, no.  I try to make it as<br/>
unconditional as I can.  That means I don&#39;t tally.  People show love in<br/>
different ways...and I am fortunate that I like to nurture (pick up after<br/>
and feed).  However, all the others in my family have different ways of<br/>
showing their love.  I like to focus on how I receive it...not on how they<br/>
give it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383890449">I hope you don&#39;t ever feel attacked. Some where I saw a bumper sticker that<br/>
said the truth will set you free but it will piss you off first. I often<br/>
come to my unschooling lists for help because they make me work harder for<br/>
my kids and not the other way around. They challenge me when I say - I am<br/>
doing the best that I can and assist me with finding other tools including<br/>
knowledge when I just can&#39;t solve a problem. When I last discussed house<br/>
cleaning one of the mothers said you have to do it every day and you have to<br/>
make it fun. Well it isn&#39;t always fun but I do try to do a little every day.<br/>
I am taking wobbly baby steps (yes a flybaby) and I keep telling any thing<br/>
worth doing is worth doing poorly at first.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My children (seven, three and six month old) do not have chores. They have<br/>
lists of things they are allowed to help with. Things that they are capable<br/>
of doing.. Got it off the web some where of what a child can do at what age.<br/>
This list empowers my children. My son loves the responsibility of taking<br/>
out the trash when he has nothing better to do. My daughter loves helping<br/>
mommy with laundry. Everyone picks up a stray sock when they see one.<br/>
Although I haven&#39;t had to touch one in months because if I see one I am<br/>
supposed to tell my daughter so she can get it. She wants to help so much<br/>
that if someone else does it - she will melt down to the point that we have<br/>
to undo it so she can do it.  My daughter who often makes a water mess in<br/>
the bathroom leaves it mostly dry and even cleans the floor.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling for me means that we do what works for our family usually when I<br/>
write here it is because I have tried everything else and it just isn&#39;t<br/>
working. We have the freedom to meet our needs. My kids do work but they<br/>
have the freedom to say no I am busy right now. Doing it the same time<br/>
everyday is genius by the way - every one gets into the habit of doing it<br/>
together at a set time. We are trying to get into a groove but right now<br/>
with the six month old and scattered bedtimes due to summer it has been hard<br/>
to keep one going for very long. The kids just don&#39;t want to go to sleep!<br/>

My kids do chores. (I&#39;ve never posted here before because I have seen how<br/>
quickly you attack people who post certain unlikeable ideas, so I&#39;m a bit<br/>
scared to continue, but chores work for us.) I don&#39;t want the kids to grow<br/>
up feeling like they have a free pass to destroy the place and follow their<br/>
every whim while I have to go behind them with a shovel and a spray<br/>
bottle!! It doesn&#39;t take that long when we all help, and I tell them it&#39;s<br/>
part of living with other people. I don&#39;t want to pick up my stinky old<br/>
socks any more than they do, but I do it as a courtesy to them to keep the<br/>
house livable. They keep the toys and whatnot picked up as a courtesy to me<br/>
for cooking their food, driving them places, and a million other things they<br/>
need me for. They each have different chores (that they chose) and we do<br/>
them right after breakfast. I clean up at the same time so we&#39;re all in it<br/>
together. I even ask the baby (16 mo) to carry her breakfast bowl to the<br/>
kitchen. She loves it! The other two (6 and 4) aren&#39;t thrilled, but they<br/>
do appreciate the expediency of having a kitchen ready for that impromptu<br/>
baking experiment, or a dining room table cleared of crumbs and ready for<br/>
play dough, and the most important - knowing where their shoes are so they<br/>
can head for the woods.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; First-time poster. I was wondering what strategies any of you might<br/>
&gt; like to pass on in terms of keeping your house tidy in your<br/>
&gt; unschooling world. I have two boys - 5 and almost 3 - and I have to<br/>
&gt; say the state of the house is really bugging me. We spend anywhere<br/>
&gt; from 30 minutes to an hour every evening tidying up (I&#39;m not talking<br/>
&gt; about cleaning, just picking up), and what happens a lot is I start<br/>
&gt; snapping at the kids (which I really don&#39;t like, because I&#39;m normally<br/>
&gt; pretty laid back and mellow), but it&#39;s usually just me putting<br/>
&gt; everything away, while they move one block at a time using a tiny lego<br/>
&gt; wheelbarrow to push it across the floor:)<br/>
&gt; We only pick up once a day, but still, it&#39;s starting to really<br/>
&gt; irritate me. I probably am a perfectionist in that I find I just feel<br/>
&gt; a lot better and my mind feels clearer when I am not looking out on a<br/>
&gt; lot of clutter (not to mention the injured feet after stepping on the<br/>
&gt; umpteenth pointy block in the kitchen floor) Interested to know any<br/>
&gt; strategies you all have either practical in terms of tidying, or<br/>
&gt; mental (i.e., coping strategies for me).<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

&gt; &quot;Keeping&quot; my house tidy just doesn&#39;t happen around here.  Nothing <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is all that consistent so that I have that perfect house all of the <br/>
time.  However, when I really have a need for a clean and tidy house <br/>
I can get pretty creative and I enjoy the creative process of <br/>
planning how to do it.  I don&#39;t usually stick to one routine because <br/>
it gets boring for me.  Here are a few suggestions that helped me:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 1)  I need adrenaline or excitement to get into the mood for <br/>
 </span></blockquote>cleaning, etc.  Sometimes I plan to have someone over just to keep <br/>
the excitement high, or I try to &quot;Surprise&quot; my husband with a really <br/>
clean house, or I play cleaning games with the kids.  One of my kids <br/>
(I have 3 and 5 yo boys and I&#39;m 34 weeks pregnant with another boy) <br/>
really likes to play I spy.  I usually spy something wrong with a <br/>
room and he puts everything back where it belongs.  Once everything <br/>
is back where it belongs, I tell him what the secret item was and if <br/>
he put it away.  Then he does the same thing in a room that I&#39;m <br/>
cleaning.  My 3yo doesn&#39;t like to do it very much if his older <br/>
brother is playing too because then he thinks that he lost.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 2)  If I have a lot of house work to do and my kids are bored, I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>play while I&#39;m cleaning.  I turn into some character and the <br/>
silliness begins.  We have pretended that our house is a hotel and we <br/>
are getting ready for a king and queen to come visit.  I play the <br/>
bossy head maid and my son loves to be the irresponsible janitor.  We <br/>
have also made giant piles of laundry to jump in and throw around.  <br/>
Then the kids usually sort it ALL for me.  My 3 yo loves to clean <br/>
with me.  He has his own cleaning cart (a kid&#39;s shopping cart) <br/>
complete with vinegar and water spray bottles, baking soda (for <br/>
scrubbing), rags, dusters, trash bags tied on the sides, and a bucket <br/>
and small mop.  He loves to wet his hands pour baking soda on them <br/>
and scrub my shower.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 3)  Another thing I like to do is make a BIGGER mess.  For example, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>if a room is really bugging me, I like to start from scratch and <br/>
reorganize or rearrange.  My kids love this!  And my oldest asks for <br/>
days if we can redo the house.  I recently emptied my entire pantry <br/>
onto the kitchen table and putting it all back took all day, but then <br/>
I had a really neat pantry.  The kids stayed busy checking out all of <br/>
the food that they usually don&#39;t see and then they loved helping me <br/>
decide how to organize it all back on the shelves.  My oldest helped <br/>
me until the very end.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 4)  Another thing that plays into the adrenaline thing for me is to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>set a timer.  When the kids ask why I&#39;m moving so fast, I tell them <br/>
and sometimes they want to get in on the fun.  I usually say <br/>
something like:  I&#39;m trying to get this room picked up in 3 minutes.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 5)  Baskets are great for a quick tidy.  I don&#39;t like to sort the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>baskets, but I just stick them in the guest room or closet and my <br/>
husband doesn&#39;t mind doing some quick sorts once in a while.  My <br/>
husband is much better at picking up and I&#39;m much better at deep <br/>
cleaning so that&#39;s usually how things get done around here.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 6)  I am very comfortable in a mess and I think that helps to keep <br/>
 </span></blockquote>things low stress.  However, I think we all function better when <br/>
things are much more tidy, so that&#39;s the way I try to keep things.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 7)  Try to think about how your kids play and how the &quot;mess&quot; is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>created.  For example, my boys love to play legos, but if they played <br/>
with them all over the floor I&#39;d be picking them up for hours.  We <br/>
use a play table (large train table with drawers under) for their <br/>
legos.  This way they never have to pick them up.  It&#39;s an ongoing <br/>
creative process.  Ask yourself &quot;What is making the mess?&quot;  &quot;How can <br/>
I make things easier on myself?&quot;  Get creative.  My boys used to <br/>
leave their dress up clothes all over the house until I created a <br/>
special &quot;dressing room&quot; in one of our closets.  We have a family <br/>
closet for all of our clothes, so that has freed up some other <br/>
closets and those are great places to make &quot;messes&quot;.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 8)  Use more &quot;grown up&quot; things for play.  For example, we used to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>have all kinds of art supplies for the kids but they always wanted to <br/>
use my husband&#39;s stuff.  We have gotten rid of all of the &quot;kid&quot; art <br/>
stuff and have simplified our art supplies.  Another example of this <br/>
is tools.  My 3yo loves tools.  He had a bunch of fake tools, but <br/>
they would get scattered all over the house.  I have started helping <br/>
him use adult tools instead and he has REALLY enjoyed this!  He likes <br/>
to hammer nails into boxes or even wood.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 9)  Consider the length of time that your kids stay interested in a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>toy.  Is it a toy that they just dig out, look at it for a second and <br/>
throw it aside?  I think that it&#39;s important for kids to &quot;check out&quot; <br/>
toys, but we usually do this at toy stores, garage sales, and other <br/>
kid&#39;s houses.  I don&#39;t keep things that don&#39;t get played with.  If <br/>
they play with their stuffed animals once a month for a long and fun <br/>
play time, then I&#39;d keep a basket of them in the top of the closet <br/>
for when they&#39;re ready for them.  But if they have a couple of <br/>
stuffed animals that they just throw aside to get to other toys, I&#39;d <br/>
get rid of them.  My friends and I love to have swap playdates, where <br/>
everyone brings a bag of toys to trade.  Only having toys around that <br/>
your kids love really seems to help with the &quot;mess&quot;.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; The bottom line is that you need to get creative to keep things <br/>
 </span></blockquote>tidy without all of the negative feelings and you have to practice <br/>
making and enjoying messes with your children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737404242">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m with Ren. Marry someone who is neater and way more organized than you,<br/>
and out of love and respect for one another, he&#39;ll help you devise systems<br/>
for keeping all the mess at bay lol! Short of that, we have laundry baskets<br/>
(plastic, with venting holes in the sides, you can get them at K-Mart or<br/>
Target) for quick tidy-ups. Having bins that have words and pictures that<br/>
represent what goes in them helps the little ones know where things go when<br/>
it&#39;s clean-up time. I think it&#39;s a bit much to expect young children to<br/>
understand our (often flawed) systems of organization, so the pictorial<br/>
representations give them a clue, and adding the words helps encourage word<br/>
recognition. Personally, I have no problem with paying older children to<br/>
help around the house, as long as they are happy with the arrangement. Right<br/>
now I have a mother&#39;s helper, and I pay them to play with the kids and<br/>
clean-up before they go, so what&#39;s the difference? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One thing I noticed with my oldest (I have two daughters, 5 yrs and 2 yrs),<br/>
when there is too much disorder, she doesn&#39;t want to play with anything, so<br/>
that is one good reason to bring the house back to order fairly regularly.<br/>
She is beginning to understand this about herself, and will sometimes<br/>
willingly help out when it&#39;s time to clean-up. Other times she doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to help, usually because she is already involved in something else, which is<br/>
fine with me. This is her time in life to have this freedom. My parents<br/>
never modeled happy clean-up time. It was always an issue in our home, as I<br/>
suspect it was in many other&#39;s homes. I think this is why so many regard<br/>
clean-up as a chore. I think we all have a real opportunity here to do<br/>
something different, something that will give our children the message that<br/>
they are loved and nurtured and respected, that they are not a burden to us,<br/>
that their play brings joy to a house, not aggravation. So when I see my<br/>
daughter frustrated because she can&#39;t find parts to a toy or game she wants<br/>
to play, I help her find the pieces, and yes, I will talk with her about<br/>
ways to avoid missing pieces in the future, by putting things back where<br/>
they belong, but I&#39;ll do it with love and care, because she deserves that.<br/>
Her job is to play and explore her world, and she is marvelous at it. My job<br/>
is to help her to do her job well. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So get some baskets, make some picture/word signs to tape onto them, play<br/>
clean-up games (with the baskets, almost anything can become a :basketball&quot;<br/>
type game), have clean-up races, have fun. Your kids deserve it, and so do<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443830924">Beth, thank you for your post. I suppose I will use this as an opportunity  <br/>
to introduce myself. I am a 47 year old single mom of 10 year old Zack. I  <br/>
consider myself an unschooling mom in progress. <br/>
 <br/>
Have been unschooling for the past year, after getting thoroughly  fed up <br/>
with the inept schooling system and mean school teachers. Short story on  it: I <br/>
had been looking into unschooling for several weeks (after realizing my  son&#39;s <br/>
current teacher was especially awful). Zack did not know about it  yet. He <br/>
came home one day, crying, after she had embarrassed him by  punishing him in <br/>
front of the whole class for something really minor. He  looked at me incredibly <br/>
seriously and said, &quot;Mom, I don&#39;t want to go back  to school.&quot; His jaw dropped <br/>
when I said, &quot;Oh honey, I don&#39;t want you to,  either.&quot; And the rest is <br/>
history. He is such a happier boy. Our  relationship is so much more fluid and easy. <br/>
I have stopped yelling. It&#39;s truly  transformed our lives.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not saying that everything is easy, by any means. I still struggle  with <br/>
getting the house clean and usually I just make Zack help. I&#39;s not always  fun <br/>
initially, but I found that if we put on his hard rock music (Linkin Park is  <br/>
his fave) we usually go to town and actually enjoy the work (with  several <br/>
dancing breaks in between). <br/>
BUT...I just asked him to read your  post, Beth, and it brought up a great <br/>
discussion between us. We are going to  change our MO. We agreed that two things <br/>
have to happen for it to work and  both of us be happy. The first is that I <br/>
have to really allow it to be  his choice to help--that if he says no, I need <br/>
to accept it and move on. The  second is that Zack needs to work on wanting to <br/>
help a little more. He  said that after he read your post, he thinks he will. <br/>
 <br/>
We will see. <br/>
 <br/>
Again, thank you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10465722">All these posts have been making me think of this past weekend.  See, last Friday early morning, I was awoken to what felt like a bug on me.  I slapped my arm and sure enough, it was!  I was so totally grossed out.  My spouse laughed and said no matter how clean the house is, we live in Florida, in a swamp, and bugs happen.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m 45yo!  I&#39;ve lived in Florida 31 years and never had a bug in my bed!  Needless to say, I wasn&#39;t sleeping in there until the room was cleaned from top to bottom including moving the mattress, heavy furniture, etc.  <br/>
 <br/>
My spouse just told me I was being silly and that he could get the whole house clean and still have time to hang out at the glider field.<br/>
 <br/>
Weeeeelllll....hmmmmm.... Ok. Bets on.  It was hard, but I left him to it.<br/>
 <br/>
Saturday came and went and nothing was done.  Movies were watched, games played and as a family, we had a really wonderful time.  (I kept my thoughts in check about messes and bugs.)<br/>
 <br/>
Sunday, I took my 18yo shopping with me.  We were gone for a few hours.  When we got home with the groceries, still nothing was done.  <br/>
 <br/>
What surprised me, was come sunset, all of a sudden, my family started cleaning!  I never said a word!  No yelling, no muttering nor requesting.  My spouse lifted the mattress so the 10yo could climb under and vacuum.  They laughed and played and by the end of the night the house was clean, the laundry all washed, folded and put away.  The kitchen floor was even washed!  <br/>
 <br/>
They helped because they wanted to and it was the sweetest thing ever.  <br/>
 <br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Keeping&quot; my house tidy just doesn&#39;t happen around here. Nothing<br/>
&gt; is all that consistent so that I have that perfect house all of the<br/>
&gt; time. However, when I really have a need for a clean and tidy house<br/>
&gt; I can get pretty creative and I enjoy the creative process of<br/>
&gt; planning how to do it. I don&#39;t usually stick to one routine because<br/>
&gt; it gets boring for me. Here are a few suggestions that helped me:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1) I need adrenaline or excitement to get into the mood for<br/>
&gt; cleaning, etc. Sometimes I plan to have someone over just to keep<br/>
&gt; the excitement high, or I try to &quot;Surprise&quot; my husband with a really<br/>
&gt; clean house, or I play cleaning games with the kids. One of my kids<br/>
&gt; (I have 3 and 5 yo boys and I&#39;m 34 weeks pregnant with another boy)<br/>
&gt; really likes to play I spy. I usually spy something wrong with a<br/>
&gt; room and he puts everything back where it belongs. Once everything<br/>
&gt; is back where it belongs, I tell him what the secret item was and if<br/>
&gt; he put it away. Then he does the same thing in a room that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; cleaning. My 3yo doesn&#39;t like to do it very much if his older<br/>
&gt; brother is playing too because then he thinks that he lost.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2) If I have a lot of house work to do and my kids are bored, I<br/>
&gt; play while I&#39;m cleaning. I turn into some character and the<br/>
&gt; silliness begins. We have pretended that our house is a hotel and we<br/>
&gt; are getting ready for a king and queen to come visit. I play the<br/>
&gt; bossy head maid and my son loves to be the irresponsible janitor. We<br/>
&gt; have also made giant piles of laundry to jump in and throw around.<br/>
&gt; Then the kids usually sort it ALL for me. My 3 yo loves to clean<br/>
&gt; with me. He has his own cleaning cart (a kid&#39;s shopping cart)<br/>
&gt; complete with vinegar and water spray bottles, baking soda (for<br/>
&gt; scrubbing), rags, dusters, trash bags tied on the sides, and a bucket<br/>
&gt; and small mop. He loves to wet his hands pour baking soda on them<br/>
&gt; and scrub my shower.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3) Another thing I like to do is make a BIGGER mess. For example,<br/>
&gt; if a room is really bugging me, I like to start from scratch and<br/>
&gt; reorganize or rearrange. My kids love this! And my oldest asks for<br/>
&gt; days if we can redo the house. I recently emptied my entire pantry<br/>
&gt; onto the kitchen table and putting it all back took all day, but then<br/>
&gt; I had a really neat pantry. The kids stayed busy checking out all of<br/>
&gt; the food that they usually don&#39;t see and then they loved helping me<br/>
&gt; decide how to organize it all back on the shelves. My oldest helped<br/>
&gt; me until the very end.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4) Another thing that plays into the adrenaline thing for me is to<br/>
&gt; set a timer. When the kids ask why I&#39;m moving so fast, I tell them<br/>
&gt; and sometimes they want to get in on the fun. I usually say<br/>
&gt; something like: I&#39;m trying to get this room picked up in 3 minutes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 5) Baskets are great for a quick tidy. I don&#39;t like to sort the<br/>
&gt; baskets, but I just stick them in the guest room or closet and my<br/>
&gt; husband doesn&#39;t mind doing some quick sorts once in a while. My<br/>
&gt; husband is much better at picking up and I&#39;m much better at deep<br/>
&gt; cleaning so that&#39;s usually how things get done around here.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 6) I am very comfortable in a mess and I think that helps to keep<br/>
&gt; things low stress. However, I think we all function better when<br/>
&gt; things are much more tidy, so that&#39;s the way I try to keep things.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 7) Try to think about how your kids play and how the &quot;mess&quot; is<br/>
&gt; created. For example, my boys love to play legos, but if they played<br/>
&gt; with them all over the floor I&#39;d be picking them up for hours. We<br/>
&gt; use a play table (large train table with drawers under) for their<br/>
&gt; legos. This way they never have to pick them up. It&#39;s an ongoing<br/>
&gt; creative process. Ask yourself &quot;What is making the mess?&quot; &quot;How can<br/>
&gt; I make things easier on myself?&quot; Get creative. My boys used to<br/>
&gt; leave their dress up clothes all over the house until I created a<br/>
&gt; special &quot;dressing room&quot; in one of our closets. We have a family<br/>
&gt; closet for all of our clothes, so that has freed up some other<br/>
&gt; closets and those are great places to make &quot;messes&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8) Use more &quot;grown up&quot; things for play. For example, we used to<br/>
&gt; have all kinds of art supplies for the kids but they always wanted to<br/>
&gt; use my husband&#39;s stuff. We have gotten rid of all of the &quot;kid&quot; art<br/>
&gt; stuff and have simplified our art supplies. Another example of this<br/>
&gt; is tools. My 3yo loves tools. He had a bunch of fake tools, but<br/>
&gt; they would get scattered all over the house. I have started helping<br/>
&gt; him use adult tools instead and he has REALLY enjoyed this! He likes<br/>
&gt; to hammer nails into boxes or even wood.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 9) Consider the length of time that your kids stay interested in a<br/>
&gt; toy. Is it a toy that they just dig out, look at it for a second and<br/>
&gt; throw it aside? I think that it&#39;s important for kids to &quot;check out&quot;<br/>
&gt; toys, but we usually do this at toy stores, garage sales, and other<br/>
&gt; kid&#39;s houses. I don&#39;t keep things that don&#39;t get played with. If<br/>
&gt; they play with their stuffed animals once a month for a long and fun<br/>
&gt; play time, then I&#39;d keep a basket of them in the top of the closet<br/>
&gt; for when they&#39;re ready for them. But if they have a couple of<br/>
&gt; stuffed animals that they just throw aside to get to other toys, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; get rid of them. My friends and I love to have swap playdates, where<br/>
&gt; everyone brings a bag of toys to trade. Only having toys around that<br/>
&gt; your kids love really seems to help with the &quot;mess&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The bottom line is that you need to get creative to keep things<br/>
&gt; tidy without all of the negative feelings and you have to practice<br/>
&gt; making and enjoying messes with your children.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Best wishes!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Keeping your house tidy<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; &gt; First-time poster. I was wondering what strategies any of you might<br/>
&gt; &gt; like to pass on in terms of keeping your house tidy in your<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling world. I have two boys - 5 and almost 3 - and I have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; say the state of the house is really bugging me. We spend anywhere<br/>
&gt; &gt; from 30 minutes to an hour every evening tidying up (I&#39;m not talking<br/>
&gt; &gt; about cleaning, just picking up), and what happens a lot is I start<br/>
&gt; &gt; snapping at the kids (which I really don&#39;t like, because I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; normally<br/>
&gt; &gt; pretty laid back and mellow), but it&#39;s usually just me putting<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything away, while they move one block at a time using a tiny<br/>
&gt; lego<br/>
&gt; &gt; wheelbarrow to push it across the floor:)<br/>
&gt; &gt; We only pick up once a day, but still, it&#39;s starting to really<br/>
&gt; &gt; irritate me. I probably am a perfectionist in that I find I just<br/>
&gt; feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; a lot better and my mind feels clearer when I am not looking out on<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot of clutter (not to mention the injured feet after stepping on<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; umpteenth pointy block in the kitchen floor) Interested to know any<br/>
&gt; &gt; strategies you all have either practical in terms of tidying, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; mental (i.e., coping strategies for me).<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; for cooking their food, driving them places, and a million other  <br/>
&gt; things they<br/>
&gt; need me for.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  If they get a choice, and they are choosing to do it as a courtesy,  <br/>
then that&#39;s exactly what we talk about as radical unschoolers. Most of  <br/>
our kids DO get to this point and it is very sweet when it happens.<br/>
<br/>
If they aren&#39;t getting a choice, then they are not doing it as a  <br/>
courtesy to you, they are doing because you&#39;re making them do it. They  <br/>
aren&#39;t showing that they care about you, they&#39;re not showing  <br/>
consideration, they aren&#39;t even showing appreciation of what you do  <br/>
for them, they&#39;re doing it because they have no choice.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s goal is really to get somebody else to pick up the toys,  <br/>
then making the kids do it is certainly workable. If a family has a  <br/>
system set up and nobody is complaining or unhappy about it, then they  <br/>
may not see any problem and may wonder why all the discussion about  <br/>
chores at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if what i just wrote was clear - my point is that someone  <br/>
might have children who are compliant types, who &quot;go along&quot; with mom&#39;s  <br/>
plan without resistance. And, Mom might be especially good at getting  <br/>
willing cooperation. It could work. We&#39;ve had periods of time in my  <br/>
children&#39;s lives during which I could say, &quot;Let&#39;s all spend some time  <br/>
cleaning the house,&quot; and they&#39;d just do it with great attitudes. I&#39;ve  <br/>
had other times that I could solicit their help if I made it fun - we  <br/>
played &#39;army&#39; - I was their sergeant and would give orders - they&#39;d  <br/>
salute and say YES SIR and run and do it. We played search and rescue  <br/>
games. We played spy games. It was really quite fun and the kids  <br/>
remember those as games as much as cleaning times.<br/>
<br/>
I honestly see no negative repercussions from the above - a key  <br/>
element, though, was that we did it only as long as the kids were into  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
However, that is quite different than chore charts with &quot;consequences&quot;  <br/>
for noncompliance. I see the possibility of negative repercussions and  <br/>
one of those is that kids who don&#39;t have a choice can&#39;t MAKE a choice  <br/>
and so they can&#39;t &quot;show courtesy&quot; if they are doing what they have  <br/>
been ordered to do. They can show compliance or resistance, that&#39;s  <br/>
about it. Lots of times kids respond with passive resistance - they do  <br/>
the minimum they can get by with. What are they learning from that?<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I went through a phase of trying to &quot;require&quot; chores, I&#39;d end  <br/>
up having to list every little thing I wanted done. I could not say,  <br/>
&quot;Clean the kitchen,&quot; I&#39;d have to say, &quot;Unload the dishwasher putting  <br/>
things in their correct places. Rinse the dishes well before putting  <br/>
them into the dishwasher. Be sure to load the dishwasher correctly or  <br/>
the dishes won&#39;t get clean. Run all the garbage down the garbage  <br/>
disposal. Sort all of the trash into the trash can or the recycling  <br/>
box. Put away any food that is out. Cover dishes before putting them  <br/>
into the refrigerator. Don&#39;t put utensils into the refrigerator with  <br/>
the leftovers. Wipe off all the counters. Wipe off the stove top.  <br/>
Clean the sink. Clean the little counter behind the sink. Sweep the  <br/>
floor. Be sure to sweep the corners and edges. Use the dustpan to pick  <br/>
up what you swept and throw it into the trash. Put the broom and  <br/>
dustpan away.&quot; And on and on. They&#39;d ONLY do what I told them to do -  <br/>
no more.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, when they &quot;choose&quot; to clean the kitchen, they take pride  <br/>
in it and do a great job and they notice that the counters need wiping  <br/>
and the floor swept and so on, and I don&#39;t have to tell them.<br/>
<br/>
Our biggest problem is not lack of willingness to help - they want to  <br/>
help and know that it feels good to be helpful. Our biggest problem is  <br/>
that we ALL have other things we&#39;d rather do and, minute by minute,  <br/>
housework always gets a lower priority than something else. So,  <br/>
sometimes I ask for help, because that supports them in doing what  <br/>
they want to do, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
ON the other hand, my oldest daughter now has her own house to care  <br/>
for and she does just fine. It gets super messy (just like ours would)  <br/>
and then she cleans it all up in a frenzy of concentrated effort.  <br/>
That&#39;s always pretty much been my style, too. As I&#39;ve gotten older, I  <br/>
have begun to enjoy keeping things a little cleaner and more organized  <br/>
by doing more ongoing day-to-day maintenance, rather than spending a  <br/>
hard-working day cleaning the house every so often. But, really, it is  <br/>
clear to me that this is just a preference - either way is fine.<br/>

My kids do chores.  (I&#39;ve never posted here before because I have seen <br/>
how<br/>
quickly you attack people who post certain unlikeable ideas, so I&#39;m a <br/>
bit<br/>
scared to continue, but chores work for us.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Advice that works *against* the parent/child relationship and <br/>
unschooling will be criticized. If it doesn&#39;t help parents unschool or <br/>
work towards a partnership with their kids, why would we let it by?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t want the kids to grow<br/>
up feeling like they have a free pass to destroy the place and follow <br/>
their<br/>
every whim while I have to go behind them with a shovel and a spray<br/>
bottle!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
So you think we *do*????<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re assuming that our goal is filthy monsters who never help.<br/>
<br/>
*My* goal is to have grown children who see caring for the people and <br/>
things they love as a normal part of a kind and generous life.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my children to expect others to do things for them out of <br/>
guilt or repayment or duty. I want them to see that I do for them out <br/>
of love and caring. And I want them to do the same for me---when <br/>
they&#39;re ready to do that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take that long when we all help, and I tell them it&#39;s<br/>
part of living with other people.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right. And mine do help. But not because I make them but because they <br/>
want to. Because it&#39;s NICE to help each other.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to pick up my stinky old<br/>
socks any more than they do, but I do it as a courtesy to them to keep <br/>
the<br/>
house livable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s the difference! I WANT to pick up my stinky old socks, so my <br/>
children do too.<br/>
<br/>
My children pick up after me out of courtesy, NOT obligation. Because <br/>
that&#39;s been modeled to them for years now.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They keep the toys and whatnot picked up as a courtesy to me<br/>
for cooking their food, driving them places, and a million other things <br/>
they<br/>
need me for.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t tie what I do for them to what they do for me. We do things for <br/>
each other because we love each other. Not because there&#39;s some running <br/>
tally sheet.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They each have different chores (that they chose) and we do<br/>
them right after breakfast.  I clean up at the same time so we&#39;re all <br/>
in it<br/>
together.  I even ask the baby  (16 mo) to carry her breakfast bowl to <br/>
the<br/>
kitchen.  She loves it!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What if she said no?<br/>
<br/>
Is it really a request? Or is it a demand cloaked in a question?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The other two (6 and 4) aren&#39;t thrilled, but they<br/>
do appreciate the expediency of having a kitchen ready for that <br/>
impromptu<br/>
baking experiment, or a dining room table cleared of crumbs and ready <br/>
for<br/>
play dough, and the most important - knowing where their shoes are so <br/>
they<br/>
can head for the woods.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Mine ARE thrilled to have a clean canvass to work on. They are thrilled <br/>
to do what it takes to get us there.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t see cleaning up after ourselves or each other as a chore. It&#39;s <br/>
a pleasure to care for the ones and the things we love.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about perception. We see it as helping each other---for no <br/>
other reason than we love each other.<br/>

&gt;&gt; them right after breakfast. I clean up at the same time so we&#39;re all in it<br/>
&gt;&gt; together. I even ask the baby (16 mo) to carry her breakfast bowl to the<br/>
&gt;&gt; kitchen. She loves it! The other two (6 and 4) aren&#39;t thrilled, but they<br/>
&gt;&gt; do appreciate the expediency of having a kitchen ready for that impromptu<br/>
&gt;&gt; baking experiment, or a dining room table cleared of crumbs and ready for<br/>
&gt;&gt; play dough, and the most important - knowing where their shoes are so they<br/>
&gt;&gt; can head for the woods.<br/>

&gt; I suppose I should just unsubscribe from the group, but my issue<br/>
&gt; here is that unschooling isn&#39;t just one thing.  This group - or<br/>
&gt; any group - doesn&#39;t &quot;own&quot; the idea.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So let&#39;s discuss what unschooling is then.  In my years of <br/>
homeschooling, I&#39;ve seen people try to define it by making it fit <br/>
what their view of unschooling is supposed to be.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just as Dayna mentioned in a video about sitting with the<br/>
&gt; kids as they watch TV, unschooling doesn&#39;t mean unsupervised<br/>
&gt; chaos.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh my, is that what you think unschooling is?  Unsupervised chaos?  I <br/>
work harder at being an unschooling mom than I worked when I had <br/>
rules in my house for cleaning, bedtimes, schoolwork, etc.  I&#39;m <br/>
always amazed when I see someone suggest that unschooling is taking <br/>
the easy way out of parenting by letting their kids run wild and do <br/>
whatever they want.  My kids aren&#39;t wild and while they do things <br/>
they want to do, they&#39;re done with my help and usually my <br/>
supervision.  I take full responsibility of what my children are <br/>
doing.  I truly believe children just want to live happily and need <br/>
my support to do so.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As a family, we&#39;ve decided that chores makes the house run<br/>
&gt; smoothly for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So your whole family sat down to discuss this and everyone <br/>
volunteered to have a chore list?  Does that mean they can choose not <br/>
to do the chores if they don&#39;t want to?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The other mom asked the question about how to keep it all clean<br/>
&gt; and I answered her with what works for my unschooled kids. Like<br/>
&gt; it or not, unschoolers come in a rainbow of degrees and you have<br/>
&gt; to accept that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure that unschoolers really come in a rainbow of degrees.  <br/>
Do they?  What are the degrees?  How are they defined?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Letting little kids stay up all hours of the night and doing all<br/>
&gt; the cleaning yourself (or just ignoring it) is fine if that works<br/>
&gt; for you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, our unschooling lifestyle is more centered on what works <br/>
for all of us, not just me, my DH or just my kids.  We are treated <br/>
equally.  I&#39;ve seen lots of unschoolers on this list and others who <br/>
feel that living freely and joyfully is unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; However, If it worked for the mom who asked the question she<br/>
&gt; probably wouldn&#39;t have asked it.<br/>
&gt; Peace, Cori<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or maybe she&#39;s interested in learning how others who have no <br/>
restrictions or expectations of their children view this topic.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been on other parenting and homeschooling boards and the general <br/>
topics like chores and bedtimes are very different from what I see on <br/>
unschooling lists.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-395904590">Thanks so much for ALL the replies - especially everyone who wrote <br/>
lengthy and considered replies, I really appreciate the time and <br/>
kindness you all had to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m armed now with some practical ideas (thanks Jeannette - I like <br/>
the idea of coming up with a lego &quot;place&quot; and I definitely need to <br/>
buy more baskets - I have some but I think I need a few empty ones at <br/>
strategic places in the house), but the two most helpful suggestions <br/>
to me were the following (and there were others that followed this <br/>
vein):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think it was Meredith who wrote that basically her home was a <br/>
canvas. She<br/>
sees it as her responsibility to provide her kids with a clean one to <br/>
create<br/>
on. This helps me a lot.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And when you do clean toys up, realize it&#39;s because *you* don&#39;t like <br/>
the<br/>
&quot;mess&quot; (what I prefer to call creative output) -- not because they <br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
like it. You are cleaning it up for your *own* sake. So don&#39;t expect <br/>
them to<br/>
naturally want to do it. &quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-269893538">Now I only have a toddler, so I can&#39;t speak to kid involvement. I <br/>
wanted to chip in though and say that I went through a big FlyLady <br/>
phase myself for a few months. The biggest thing for me is the weekly <br/>
zones. She has a rotation--third week is bathrooms, etc. (Although I <br/>
don&#39;t know if that is correct. I just write it in my calendar.) This <br/>
is what keeps me from panicking. My whole life, I would stare at <br/>
things in my house and think I *should* take care of it. Now it never <br/>
takes me more than 2 months, because every week I look for something <br/>
that needs to be done/maintained/deep-cleaned in that room. If I plan <br/>
it and it doesn&#39;t happen, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ll NEVER do it--I know <br/>
I&#39;ll do it next month. Likewise, the day to day mess that builds up <br/>
doesn&#39;t freak me out as bad because I know once a month I clear any <br/>
piles away. Well, most, anyway. :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I follow Flylady&#39;s routines loosley, and the important messages I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>took away are:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  If it matters to you, do it yourself.  Don&#39;t mope because no <br/>
 </span></blockquote>one else thinks it is important and won&#39;t do it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.  If you do it, they will follow.  Model the behavior or actions, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and the family may pick up on it...or not.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.  You can accomplish a lot in 15 minutes a day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have allergies, fleas, and roaches (yay, FL) so keeping the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>house tidy is important to me for the health of the family.  I keep <br/>
those ideas in mind when doing housework, and find my house generally <br/>
tidy by doing about 15-30 minutes a day.<br/>
