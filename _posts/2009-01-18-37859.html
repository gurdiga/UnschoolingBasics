<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127171522">So, here&#39;s a man with an alcoholic father, a neglectful mother, unsupportive and divorced parents. He&#39;s married to a wife who isn&#39;t supportive of, but rather derisive of, his passion (but who is happily married). He has at least one child who hates him. And he&#39;d rather play a game than work or engage in activities with his family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing he wasn&#39;t unschooled. I&#39;m guessing he was never loved and appreciated for Who He Is. I&#39;m guessing that his passions have never been supported. I&#39;m guessing he needs a place where he can go where he is respected, where he is empowered, and where he can be whoever he wants to be.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It helps when that place is *home*. When it&#39;s not, we tend to search for---and hopefully FIND--- the best alternative. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one has implied that you weren&#39;t happy in you marriage---although that&#39;s what you inferred (you haven&#39;t said one nice thing about him yet).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s been *implied* is that HE is unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My child is loved and appreciated and empowered at *home*. He has no need to search elsewhere. For *him* WoW is just *fun*. He&#39;s not trying to escape anything.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t post something you&#39;d rather not---or can&#39;t---defend. This is an unschooling list. We want to bring parents and children CLOSER together. Fearful parents are NOT better parents. Dire warnings and fear-mongering do NOT make better parents.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you can find an example of an UNSCHOOLED child who plays WoW until he dies, or is abducted by an internet st<br/>
alker, or watches TV until his eyes fall out, or eats only sugar until he explodes, or will NEVER go to sleep, or any of the other zillions of ridiculous predictions people give that would happen if they &quot;let their children do suchandsuch&quot;---again, I&#39;ll eat my hat. <br/>

My husband has been <br/>
addicted to it for years! i can&#39;t get him off of it. he looks for ways to stay <br/>
home from activities/work so he can play. I have seen him actually sit for 10 hrs!!! <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
he refuses to accept his addiction & no his parents did not <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
support him. His father was a major acholoic & mother too <br/>
busy w/ step father & self help seminars to worry about him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 i have a 23 yr old who hates his father because his <br/>
father was absentee his whole life.  My 11 & 12 yr old girls are just as well <br/>
adjusted as your wonderful children are except that they have an absentee <br/>
father.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wish everyone would stop inpliying that i am not happy in my<br/>
marriage! I am perfectly happy & have the relationship <br/>
that i want. Just not the one I want for my kids. Never <br/>
implied I was unhappy!  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
keep reading it is implied somewhere that i need to <br/>
find out why he is escaping me. Thank for your thoughts. <br/>
