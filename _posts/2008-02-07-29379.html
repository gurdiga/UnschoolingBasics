<div id="ygrps-yiv-708928145">OK, this should be a quick and easy answer...maybe =)<br/>
<br/>
This morning I was talking to my 11 yr old son and he was mouthing<br/>
off.  (We were discussing household chores meaning what is done around<br/>
a house to keep it running smoothly.)  And he was saying he wanted<br/>
some extra money to buy something.  I told him he could earn it by<br/>
helping to clean up around the yard but that it was his choice.  (And<br/>
no, I don&#39;t have the money to just hand him everything he wants under<br/>
the sun...I have to save when I want something that I don&#39;t need.  He<br/>
has his needs completely taken care of.  His wants we have to work on<br/>
budgeting for.)  Anyway, rather than me doing it all, I offered I<br/>
would pay him to help me.  He said &quot;No, I&#39;m not doing that because you<br/>
will want it done your way and I don&#39;t want to put up with that.&quot;  I<br/>
said &quot;OK that&#39;s your choice.&quot;  Then he said &quot;You always do that, say<br/>
we have a choice when we don&#39;t.  If I don&#39;t help I can&#39;t earn extra<br/>
money and so you say I have a choice when I don&#39;t.  You are so mean<br/>
that way.&quot;  And I don&#39;t think I was being mean at all.  I offered him<br/>
the choice to help me in the yard or not that&#39;s his choice.  And it<br/>
hurt my feelings.  So I said &quot;It hurts my feelings when you say I&#39;m<br/>
mean when I&#39;m trying to help you find ways to get what you want.&quot;  And<br/>
then he started to cry.  I asked him why he was crying and he said<br/>
&quot;When you say I hurt your feelings that makes me sad because it means<br/>
you hate me.&quot;  OK that SO doesn&#39;t mean that.  I explained that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I hate him at all but that I have feelings too, and they<br/>
get hurt.  And that in his life he&#39;s going to meet people that are<br/>
more sensitive than others and that&#39;s just the way life is.  And in<br/>
the middle of me talking he butted in and started to talk over me.  So<br/>
I said &quot;Excuse me, I was speaking.  It&#39;s impolite to interrupt others<br/>
when they are talking.  I listen when you speak, it&#39;s disrespectful to<br/>
me to not offer me the same courtesy that I extend to you.&quot;  And<br/>
that&#39;s when he freaked out.  Told me I shouldn&#39;t tell him he&#39;s being<br/>
disrespectful because that makes him feel bad.<br/>
<br/>
So what do I do?  If my husband talked to me that way I&#39;d have<br/>
responded the same way.  If my mother did it I would have responded<br/>
the same way.  If a friend did it same thing.  So I don&#39;t think I was<br/>
being heavy handed with him because he&#39;s a kid.  I have feelings too<br/>
just like he does.  If I&#39;m trying to respect his feelings and his<br/>
wants he should do the same with me and everyone else in the house<br/>
yes?  And if I am wrong can someone offer a different script for this<br/>
exchange?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130191777">First of all I have to giggle at your subject line.  I think struggles<br/>
often come with children at different ages and then the statement<br/>
comes to mind  &quot;# is such a hard age&quot;.  It&#39;s kind of like when your<br/>
out with your child and they do something neat publicly and someone<br/>
walks by and says, &quot;thats such a great age&quot;.  They are all tough and<br/>
great.  I could even put my own age in there.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m gonna give this a shot because I sometimes have similar struggles<br/>
with my 9 year old.  He is very intense and sometimes his tone of<br/>
voice is very negative.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I told him he could earn it by<br/>
&gt; helping to clean up around the yard but that it was his choice.  (And<br/>
&gt; no, I don&#39;t have the money to just hand him everything he wants under<br/>
&gt; the sun...I have to save when I want something that I don&#39;t need.  He<br/>
&gt; has his needs completely taken care of.  His wants we have to work on<br/>
&gt; budgeting for.)  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Instead of giving him the one &quot;chore&quot; to earn money.  Maybe you could<br/>
have had a list of things to choose from or even asked him what he<br/>
would like to do.  In another scenario, if you have the money to give<br/>
him for yard work, why don&#39;t you you just let him have it?  Were you<br/>
going to spend it somewhere else?  (I definitely could be wrong there,<br/>
but I don&#39;t see a problem with it letting a child have a few bucks if<br/>
they ask for it)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, rather than me doing it all, I offered I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; would pay him to help me.  He said &quot;No, I&#39;m not doing that because you<br/>
&gt; will want it done your way and I don&#39;t want to put up with that.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t blame him.  If this is what he believes then its probably<br/>
because it either IS that way or WAS that way.  I don&#39;t know how long<br/>
you have been unschooling, but he might need time to trust that he can<br/>
do something HIS way.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You are so mean that way.&quot;  And I don&#39;t think I was being mean at<br/>
&gt;all.  I offered him the choice to help me in the yard or not that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;his choice.  And it hurt my feelings.  So I said &quot;It hurts my<br/>
&gt;feelings when you say I&#39;m mean when I&#39;m trying to help you find ways<br/>
&gt;to get what you want.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did it really hurt your feelings?  Or were you trying to make a point?<br/>
 As a parent, I know that many of things my children say I can&#39;t take<br/>
personally.  They are children and don&#39;t always have the tools to<br/>
express their anger and frustration.  I would have left that alone. <br/>
He&#39;s is allowed to think your mean without you trying to change his<br/>
mind.  That&#39;s his CHIOCE.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 So<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I said &quot;Excuse me, I was speaking.  It&#39;s impolite to interrupt others<br/>
&gt; when they are talking.  I listen when you speak, it&#39;s disrespectful to<br/>
&gt; me to not offer me the same courtesy that I extend to you.&quot;  And<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s when he freaked out.  Told me I shouldn&#39;t tell him he&#39;s being<br/>
&gt; disrespectful because that makes him feel bad.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It does.  I have an interrupter.  Big time!  I&#39;ve chosen not to say<br/>
anything anymore.  I don&#39;t even know if I should.  I do know that when<br/>
I let it go.  It wasn&#39;t a big deal anymore.  He&#39;s a kid.  Kids<br/>
interrupt.  I interrupt!  Someone told me it was a Northeast thing. <br/>
we all interrupt each other.  Ever been to Boston?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So what do I do?  If my husband talked to me that way I&#39;d have<br/>
&gt; responded the same way.  If my mother did it I would have responded<br/>
&gt; the same way.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your mother and husband aren&#39;t allowed to form opinions about you<br/>
unless you approve?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So I don&#39;t think I  being heavy handed with him because he&#39;s a kid.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He thinks so.  And his opinion should be valuable to you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I made a pact with myself the other day.  It&#39;s February and we are<br/>
getting some cabin fever around here.  There&#39;s been some struggles.  I<br/>
decided, that I was going to TALK LESS and DO MORE.  It&#39;s really<br/>
working.  The more I point stuff out, the worse the struggles get.  If<br/>
I just solve the problems, they see me using problem solving and learn<br/>
that way.  <br/>
<br/>
I REALLY hope this helps.  It sounds like you have a very intense 11<br/>
year old.  So do I!  (9)  I know how hard and frustrating it can be to<br/>
stay in the now and parent that way you&#39;d like when the emotional<br/>
response is so extreme.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762411484"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; OK, this should be a quick and easy answer...maybe =)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Relatively so, but not the answer I think you&#39;re expecting!<br/>
<br/>
I think you need to listen to what your son is saying. He&#39;s reacting  <br/>
to how the world feels to him, not to how you believe it looks.  <br/>
Regardless of what the intent of your words and actions is, he&#39;s  <br/>
feeling them differently.<br/>
<br/>
 From what you wrote, I&#39;d say he&#39;s spot on. It *isn&#39;t* fun to help  <br/>
someone who wants a clone of themselves. Free help should be  <br/>
appreciated regardless of what&#39;s expected. In fact throw expectations  <br/>
away. Appreciate the *time* someone has taken from their life to do  <br/>
something for you. Paid help should be different, but if you&#39;ve  <br/>
gotten into this type of interaction over free help in the past, the  <br/>
difference will take some healing with a lot of pure unadulterated  <br/>
appreciation of free help.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;You always do that, say<br/>
&gt; we have a choice when we don&#39;t.  If I don&#39;t help I can&#39;t earn extra<br/>
&gt; money and so you say I have a choice when I don&#39;t.  You are so mean<br/>
&gt; that way.&quot;  And I don&#39;t think I was being mean at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Doesn&#39;t make a difference. *He* sees it his way and he&#39;s going to  <br/>
react to how he sees it. If you respond in the way *you* want him to  <br/>
see the world, you&#39;ll be butting heads and he&#39;ll feel unheard.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve had years to learn how to be patient with someone who&#39;s still  <br/>
feeling his way. He *isn&#39;t* trying to hurt you. He&#39;s just trying to  <br/>
solve a problem with skills that aren&#39;t up to the task. They will  <br/>
grow. He doesn&#39;t need lessons in the moment on how to relate. Help  <br/>
him solve the problem. Don&#39;t change the focus.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I offered him<br/>
&gt; the choice to help me in the yard or not that&#39;s his choice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What you offered was my way or the highway. What he wants is someone  <br/>
to help him solve his problem. Be his advocate. If one solution falls  <br/>
through, help him think of another. Help him think of dozens.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I said &quot;It hurts my feelings when you say I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; mean when I&#39;m trying to help you find ways to get what you want.&quot;  And<br/>
&gt; then he started to cry.  I asked him why he was crying and he said<br/>
&gt; &quot;When you say I hurt your feelings that makes me sad because it means<br/>
&gt; you hate me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, listen to what he&#39;s telling you.<br/>
<br/>
It *can* be frustrating, certainly, but remove yourself from the  <br/>
equation. It&#39;s not about you. It&#39;s about him and a problem he&#39;s  <br/>
having. Get yourself out of the way of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t tell him he&#39;s hurt your feelings in a situation like this. It  <br/>
takes the focus off the problem and turns him into the problem.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; OK that SO doesn&#39;t mean that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To him it does.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And that in his life he&#39;s going to meet people that are<br/>
&gt; more sensitive than others and that&#39;s just the way life is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He wants to buy something. You&#39;ve turned it into a lecture on how  <br/>
inadequate he is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And in<br/>
&gt; the middle of me talking he butted in and started to talk over  <br/>
&gt; me.   So<br/>
&gt; I said &quot;Excuse me, I was speaking.  It&#39;s impolite to interrupt others<br/>
&gt; when they are talking.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I went to someone I trusted for help and they started lecturing me  <br/>
on something that was unrelated, I&#39;d be irritated too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I listen when you speak, it&#39;s disrespectful to<br/>
&gt; me to not offer me the same courtesy that I extend to you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, perhaps what you do is wait until he&#39;s done speaking, but  <br/>
what you&#39;re doing is listening to see if you agree with what he&#39;s  <br/>
saying and then tell him he&#39;s wrong. You *aren&#39;t* listening to his  <br/>
words and trying to understand *him*.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d probably get a lot out of:<br/>

going to spend it somewhere else? (I definitely could be wrong there,<br/>
but I don&#39;t see a problem with it letting a child have a few bucks if<br/>
they ask for it)<br/>
<br/>
**OK well I had given a list of things he could choose from.  And we<br/>
don&#39;t just have the money to give him.  Plus he&#39;s very selfish,<br/>
(something I&#39;ve noticed but not said to him or anyone else.)  And he<br/>
doesn&#39;t take very good care of his things unless he&#39;s worked to get<br/>
them.  So I figured it would be good for him all around.<br/>
Additionally, he saved all his holiday money and bought himself<br/>
something he really wanted and it gave him a sense of pride about what<br/>
he had done.  And that *is* good for him.  So I figured this would be<br/>
good.  I wish we had so much disposable income I could just hand them<br/>
100.00 and say &quot;have fun&quot; but we don&#39;t.  As I mentioned I have to save<br/>
for things I want rather than need.  I do jobs myself rather than pay<br/>
someone to do something or am very economical at the grocery to eek<br/>
out some little extra money.  So no, just handing it over isn&#39;t really<br/>
an option and on top of it all we are saving to take them to Disney<br/>
(which they know about) in June for their Star Wars weekend.  So<br/>
giving them each (I have two boys 9 and 11) 100.00 for a<br/>
skateboard/ripper thingy would cut into the vacation money.  I suppose<br/>
I could give them the option of having one but not the other.  Or<br/>
getting to go but no souveniers.  I just think they will have more fun<br/>
at the Disney thing.  (AND I discussed this with them and the 9 yr old<br/>
is willing to wait until his bday for his ripper 9 yr old DOB 9 Sept<br/>
11 yr old 15 Oct)  Because the 9 yr old wants that Disney thing and<br/>
wants money to spend there.  Like I said I wish we had it, but we<br/>
don&#39;t.  I give them little bits of money here and there all the time.<br/>
But a big purchase like that is too much for me to swing as<br/>
disposable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, rather than me doing it all, I offered I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would pay him to help me. He said &quot;No, I&#39;m not doing that because you<br/>
&gt; &gt; will want it done your way and I don&#39;t want to put up with that.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t blame him. If this is what he believes then its probably<br/>
&gt; because it either IS that way or WAS that way. I don&#39;t know how long<br/>
&gt; you have been unschooling, but he might need time to trust that he can<br/>
&gt; do something HIS way.<br/>
<br/>
**Well here&#39;s the problem with this...we live on base.  And the yard<br/>
work needs to be done THEIR way.  Not mine.  Not his.  And if he&#39;s not<br/>
going to do it up to the code we&#39;ve agreed to abide by then he&#39;s not<br/>
really doing it and so there isn&#39;t any reason for me to pay him for<br/>
helping if he&#39;s going to do it his way.  I&#39;m OK with the idea that<br/>
everything should be what and how he wants with his area, his body,<br/>
etc...but we do live with a set of rules and they have to be followed.<br/>
 So if he&#39;s not going to do what the list asks for then he&#39;s not<br/>
really doing it.  He could pick something else from the list I gave<br/>
him.  AND I gave him the option of not doing anything at all.  It was<br/>
a choice. Not a command disguised as a choice.  But if he chooses to<br/>
help with the yard then he has to do what needs to be done.  I don&#39;t<br/>
like the rule either but it is what it is.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Did it really hurt your feelings? Or were you trying to make a point?<br/>
&gt; As a parent, I know that many of things my children say I can&#39;t take<br/>
&gt; personally. They are children and don&#39;t always have the tools to<br/>

&gt; He&#39;s is allowed to think your mean without you trying to change his<br/>
&gt; mind. That&#39;s his CHIOCE.<br/>
<br/>
**Yeah it really did hurt my feelings.  I go out of my way, choosing<br/>
my words carefully, trying to parent them with more respect than I was<br/>
ever shown and for that he goes after me.  It did hurt my feelings.<br/>
He is allowed to think I&#39;m mean that part didn&#39;t bother me.  He&#39;s been<br/>
saying that since he could talk.  I also got the &quot;I hate you!&quot;  thing<br/>
when he was 2.  That&#39;s normal frustration.  But when I&#39;m trying to<br/>
help him and he says I&#39;m trying to hurt him then yeah that hurts me.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; It does. I have an interrupter. Big time! I&#39;ve chosen not to say<br/>
&gt; anything anymore. I don&#39;t even know if I should. I do know that when<br/>
&gt; I let it go. It wasn&#39;t a big deal anymore. He&#39;s a kid. Kids<br/>
&gt; interrupt. I interrupt! Someone told me it was a Northeast thing.<br/>
&gt; we all interrupt each other. Ever been to Boston?<br/>
<br/>
**I&#39;m from Boston.  But interrupting is a constant problem with him.<br/>
And it&#39;s not showing others the respect he wants to be shown.  If his<br/>
brother interrupts him when he&#39;s speaking his head blows off.  He<br/>
hates it.  So it&#39;s not a foreign concept for him.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Your mother and husband aren&#39;t allowed to form opinions about you<br/>
&gt; unless you approve?<br/>
<br/>
**Nope they are allowed to form whatever opinions they want but if<br/>
they say something ugly and mean and it hurts my feelings I&#39;m going to<br/>
say that it hurt and if they interrupt me, then I&#39;m going to say that<br/>
I would like to be shown the same respect I show them.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He thinks so. And his opinion should be valuable to you.<br/>
***His opinion is valuable, but it is not the only opinion that<br/>
matters here.  There are 5 of us.  And one can&#39;t rule.  The &quot;rule&quot;<br/>
here is that everyone has the right to feel safe, happy and loved.<br/>
And so we try not to do things that make others not feel that way.<br/>
Sometimes there is going to be conflict between what two or more<br/>
people want but this is a constant thing with him.  He&#39;s SO high<br/>
strung.  And wants what he wants all the time.  Me too, only I know<br/>
that can&#39;t happen.  His brother too...etc....<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I REALLY hope this helps. It sounds like you have a very intense 11<br/>
&gt; year old. So do I! (9) I know how hard and frustrating it can be to<br/>
&gt; stay in the now and parent that way you&#39;d like when the emotional<br/>
&gt; response is so extreme.<br/>
<br/>
***He uses this extremity against his brother too.  So it&#39;s something<br/>
we have to change.  It&#39;s not going to serve him well in life.  His<br/>
interpersonal relationships often suffer because of it.  And I want to<br/>
see him have better friends and be happier.  This really is a<br/>
stumbling block for him with others not just me.<br/>

I have to agree with  him 100%. Based on what you wrote, he is being<br/>
treated disrespectfully and with little choice. If he can earn the<br/>
money, then you can also budget the money to simply give him. Do the<br/>
yardwork together, because you&#39;re a team and don&#39;t hold him to your<br/>
standard. <br/>

<br/>
As long as he is seen as a &quot;selfish&quot; person, you are going to have<br/>
struggles with him. He is doing the best he can. The parents need to<br/>
change the way they see him and be his advocate rather than his enemy.<br/>

<br/>
The stumbling block is in the way you view him. You see him as someone<br/>
that needs to be changed. You&#39;re focused on how to change his<br/>
behavior. He knows this. He is not accepted and cherished for exactly<br/>
who-he-is right NOW. So he&#39;s intense. Some of that intensity would<br/>
probably diminish if he felt the adults in his life were on his side,<br/>
were there to help him get what he wants/needs.<br/>

When you say &quot;it&#39;s something we have to change&quot; that is very<br/>
worrisome. You can force him to change his behavior just to please<br/>
you. That isn&#39;t real change. That isn&#39;t optimal for unschooling.<br/>
Support him in the place he&#39;s in TODAY. Most of the problem I am<br/>
reading, is about how you view this child and the struggles the adults<br/>
are setting up. Quit struggling. Quit working against him. Ask<br/>
yourself how you can help him get what he wants rather than set up a<br/>
false situation that is not based on truth. If there is money to pay<br/>
for a job, you have SOME kind of money to help him out. He&#39;s smart. He<br/>
knows this is false and sees right through it.<br/>
<br/>
I remember seeing right through that kind of lie adults told me and it<br/>
made me a very angry person. He shouldn&#39;t have to jump through hoops<br/>
to get help. Give him MORE access, not less.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689867164"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; **OK well I had given a list of things he could choose from.  And we<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t just have the money to give him.  Plus he&#39;s very selfish,<br/>
&gt; (something I&#39;ve noticed but not said to him or anyone else.)  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You said it to all of us.  And your thinking it.  Stop making excuses.<br/>
   If he is selfish all you can do is model unselfish behavior.  You<br/>
can&#39;t force him to not be selfish.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; doesn&#39;t take very good care of his things unless he&#39;s worked to get<br/>
&gt; them.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There his things you need to respect that.  My child is quite similar.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So I figured it would be good for him all around.<br/>
&gt; Additionally, he saved all his holiday money and bought himself<br/>
&gt; something he really wanted and it gave him a sense of pride about<br/>
&gt;what he had done.  And that *is* good for him.  So I figured this<br/>
&gt;would be good.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You figured wrong.  Christmas was on his terms.  This time it wasn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wish we had so much disposable income I could just hand them<br/>
&gt; 100.00 and say &quot;have fun&quot; but we don&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who does?  That&#39;s a lot of money.  My point was, you were willing to<br/>
pay him fo working in the yard.  So you obviously had a few extra<br/>
dollars for him.  It&#39;s not like you were going to use it to pay<br/>
someone else right?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As I mentioned I have to save for things I want rather than need.  I<br/>
&gt;do jobs myself rather than pay someone to do something or am very<br/>
&gt;economical at the grocery to eek out some little extra money.  So no,<br/>
&gt;just handing it over isn&#39;t really an option and on top of it all we<br/>
&gt;are saving to take them to Disney (which they know about) in June for<br/>
&gt;their Star Wars weekend.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You keep mentioning it and I think you need to visit your own<br/>
resentments about your tight budget.  Have you ever sat down and<br/>
showed him on a piece of paper how your paychecks get divvied up and<br/>
why there isn&#39;t much left?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So giving them each (I have two boys 9 and 11) 100.00 for a<br/>
&gt; skateboard/ripper thingy would cut into the vacation money.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you can&#39;t afford a skateboard, then you can&#39;t afford a skateboard.<br/>
 You&#39;ve turned it into an argument.  No one has it all.  Maybe you<br/>
feel guilty.  You&#39;re trying to force a learning/saving money<br/>
experience.  It won&#39;t work.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; **Well here&#39;s the problem with this...we live on base.  And the yard<br/>
&gt; work needs to be done THEIR way.  Not mine.  Not his.  And if he&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; going to do it up to the code we&#39;ve agreed to abide by then he&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; really doing it and so there isn&#39;t any reason for me to pay him for<br/>
&gt; helping if he&#39;s going to do it his way.  I&#39;m OK with the idea that<br/>
&gt; everything should be what and how he wants with his area, his body,<br/>
&gt; etc...but we do live with a set of rules and they have to be followed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then you follow them.  Let him do the yard work to the best of his<br/>
ability at the time.  Then YOU pick up the slack.  (without complaint)<br/>
Your son did not agree to abide by the base rules.  YOU DID.  Your son<br/>
did not choose to live on base.  YOU DID.  He is frustrated with<br/>
your/the bases rules, and you as the mom should be accepting and<br/>
loving his help in any form.  And if it isn&#39;t up to code...  then get<br/>
outside and make it up to code.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  So if he&#39;s not going to do what the list asks for then he&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; really doing it.  He could pick something else from the list I gave<br/>
&gt; him.  AND I gave him the option of not doing anything at all.  It was<br/>
&gt; a choice. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not a choice.  This is &quot;my way or the highway&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; **Yeah it really did hurt my feelings.  I go out of my way, choosing<br/>
&gt; my words carefully, trying to parent them with more respect than I was<br/>
&gt; ever shown and for that he goes after me.  It did hurt my feelings.<br/>
&gt; He is allowed to think I&#39;m mean that part didn&#39;t bother me.  He&#39;s been<br/>
&gt; saying that since he could talk.  I also got the &quot;I hate you!&quot;  thing<br/>
&gt; when he was 2.  That&#39;s normal frustration.  But when I&#39;m trying to<br/>
&gt; help him and he says I&#39;m trying to hurt him then yeah that hurts me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The truth hurts.  He&#39;s telling you the truth.  Someone else already<br/>
said it, but your turning his problems into his inadequacy.  He feels<br/>
your being mean.  It&#39;s fairly obvious why.  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; **I&#39;m from Boston.  But interrupting is a constant problem with him.<br/>
&gt; And it&#39;s not showing others the respect he wants to be shown.  If<br/>
&gt;his  brother interrupts him when he&#39;s speaking his head blows off. <br/>
&gt;He hates it.  So it&#39;s not a foreign concept for him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funny coincidence you being from Boston.  you can&#39;t force this stuff.<br/>
 you will only build resentment.  He&#39;s going to resent you.  My guess<br/>
is he already does.  I bet you interupt HIM to tell him he&#39;s<br/>
interrupting YOU.  While your logic may be telling you one thing, two<br/>
wrongs don&#39;t make right.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Your mother and husband aren&#39;t allowed to form opinions about you<br/>
&gt; &gt; unless you approve?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **Nope they are allowed to form whatever opinions they want but if<br/>
&gt; they say something ugly and mean and it hurts my feelings I&#39;m going to<br/>
&gt; say that it hurt and if they interrupt me, then I&#39;m going to say that<br/>
&gt; I would like to be shown the same respect I show them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they are adults with years of experience in handling their emotions. <br/>
your child does not have that same experience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;rule&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; here is that everyone has the right to feel safe, happy and loved.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He doesn&#39;t.  What are you willing to do to change that.  <br/>
<br/>
And wants what he wants all the time.  Me too, only I know<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that can&#39;t happen.  His brother too...etc....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Look, your just being argumentative.  All children are different.  I<br/>
will tell you that my 9 year old requires more attention and love and<br/>
handholding than my 3 year old.  It&#39;s just the way things are.  I get<br/>
frustrated too sometimes.  He&#39;s really intense.  He&#39;s fairly<br/>
demanding.  I&#39;ll say it again...  all children are different.  the<br/>
expectation that they should all be the same or act the saem or feel<br/>
the same is ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ***He uses this extremity against his brother too.  So it&#39;s something<br/>
&gt; we have to change.  It&#39;s not going to serve him well in life.  His<br/>
&gt; interpersonal relationships often suffer because of it.  And I want to<br/>
&gt; see him have better friends and be happier.  This really is a<br/>
&gt; stumbling block for him with others not just me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe if you just let it go and quit trying to control him and his<br/>
feelings and his behaviors he wouldn&#39;t feel so overwhelmed with<br/>
expectations.  Yours are high.  I couldn&#39;t even live up to them and<br/>
I&#39;m a rational (sometimes.  hehe) adult.  <br/>

<br/>
But he was trying to express his frustration and I doubt he&#39;s feeling<br/>
safe in being able to do that now. He obviously does NOT want to hurt<br/>
his mother&#39;s feelings but the first chance he got to express how he<br/>
really felt, it got shut down with an emotional outburst from<br/>
Mom...taking his feelings personally. He has a right to think you&#39;re<br/>
mean! A safe home means he&#39;s should feel safe in expressing some<br/>
difficult feelings he&#39;s having towards you too. As adults, we should<br/>
have the tools to be a sounding board for them and give them options<br/>
for expressing anger and frustration. <br/>
<br/>
What he said did not sound mean to me. It sounded like a frustrated<br/>
kiddo that needed to be heard and empathized with. Rather than telling<br/>
him how it hurt your feelings, could you not have just reflectively<br/>
listened? &quot;So you feel like I&#39;m not being fair?&quot; and explored it<br/>
further to help you understand where he&#39;s coming from!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ya know, I couldn&#39;t do that right now either. But I can certainly<br/>
listen to what my child wants, brainstorm ideas for helping them get<br/>
what they want and give that child $20 towards the skateboard today.<br/>
Modeling how to get what we want is a valuable tool for children.<br/>
<br/>
A child that knows you are on their side, a child that knows you WANT<br/>
them to have what they want, is a less frustrated child. A child whose<br/>
mother sees them as &quot;selfish&quot; is going to act out more, because they<br/>
aren&#39;t in a safe environment. &quot;Safe&quot; is a big word that has a lot to<br/>
do with emotional safety. It should be safe to call someone an asshole<br/>
and feel they will listen and try to figure out what will work better.<br/>

You&#39;re not or you wouldn&#39;t be here!:)The worst parents wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
asking questions or caring about the outcome. You obviously care very<br/>
much. But there are some big stumbling blocks in your relationship and<br/>
the way you view your child that we&#39;re trying to point out. Sometimes<br/>
it isn&#39;t easy to hear....believe me I know this.  If you&#39;re willing to<br/>

~~Why do I always feel like you all<br/>

<br/>
That is not constructive criticism.  That&#39;s hurtful speak.  And then<br/>
you said he feels that his family doesn&#39;t love nor support him.  That<br/>
is not constructive criticism that&#39;s saying I abuse and neglect my<br/>
son.  He&#39;s NOT unloved.<br/>
<br/>
I am listening.  I am trying to hear how to balance how to make him<br/>
happy all the time and keep everyone else happy all the time<br/>
especially when what he wants so often requires others not only to be<br/>
unhappy but miserable.  Like when he tells his 9 yr old brother that<br/>
life would be better if he just died.  That&#39;s not nice.   And it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that John should be cuddled and loved on when he is<br/>
hateful to his brother.  It&#39;s the hardest thing in the world for me to<br/>
figure out what to do when one of my kids hurts the other.  And FYI<br/>
that exchange followed Liam asking John not to throw his things.  I<br/>
heard Liam ask him in a nice way.  And he responds with wishing Liam<br/>
was dead???  And when I say that wasn&#39;t a nice thing to say he<br/>
responds with &quot;well he shouldn&#39;t get his feelings hurt by that I&#39;m<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-91152878">Hi folks I decided to jump on this thread because even though I don&#39;t have a 11 year old that perhaps some of what is being talked about may be something I need to hear also.  I didn&#39;t expect to find bickering.  Now the peace keeper in me wants to come out.<br/>
   <br/>
  Karen,  I have felt this way on groups before  -- this one and others I&#39;m on -- matter of fact recently on another group a guy basically told me I should put my son back into school until I get a grip... OUCH   I felt hurt, angry, defensive.  But I didn&#39;t respond right away, I just thought on it, cried, etc.  After a bit I excepted that my action did sound &quot;out of control&quot; and later the man said that he had a brother that lost his kids because the mother wouldn&#39;t get help for her abusive behavior -- so basically my post set off something inside him -- which I understood completely.  I wasn&#39;t happy with my ways either that was why I was reaching out for help.   Anyway, please , please, try to step back and view your posts and others from an outside angle.  When reading Heathers post I truly don&#39;t see anything in it that you really didn&#39;t say yourself (even in the post before the one below!) Now I don&#39;t think the &quot;truth hurts&quot; statement was polite but ??? let it go.   I<br/>
 truly believe that everyone on these lists mean well.  Remember also we when just communicating via e-mail many times things can be misinterpreted.  We can&#39;t hear your voice tones and such ...   <br/>
   <br/>
  Anyway,  Karen you are doing the best you can -- and always trying to improve  -- just like the rest of us.  Take a deep breath surround beautiful white light around you and know that you are one with the divine ....  Good.... Now hug yourself and forgive yourself for your actions... no more quilt!! now go hug your kids.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Again, thank you for being willing to speak up and look for solutions. ...  Remember though, really search for what is right for your family!!   <br/>

          Hey that&#39;s unfair. He&#39;s not unsupported by his family. Now you are<br/>
saying that he&#39;s unloved. That is NOT true. When he&#39;s blown up at a<br/>
friend he gets a hug and we talk about what happened and how he could<br/>
have done things differently. What am I supposed to do? Go yell at<br/>
the other kid? Make sure all interactions my son has always go his<br/>
way? Last night he got angry with a friend for bumping him when they<br/>
were playing on the trampoline. He freaked out and screamed at his<br/>
BROTHER who wasn&#39;t even on the trampoline. So they both come in the<br/>
door crying. So I&#39;m supposed to what? Hug John and tell Liam to suck<br/>
it up because his brother is intense? Honestly, I do not try to abuse<br/>
my kids. I go out of my way to be kind and sensitive to them and<br/>
their needs. But there is more than just one of them...and John&#39;s<br/>
needs and wants can&#39;t be more important than everyone else&#39;s. He has<br/>
to give when he doesn&#39;t want to as well as the rest of us. Conflict<br/>
usually needs compromise to come to solution. But I didn&#39;t deserve<br/>
you taking a swipe at my parenting. I don&#39;t tell him what he did<br/>
wrong. I help him see how things unfolded and how a different<br/>
reaction would have yeilded a different result. What am I supposed to<br/>
do if that is an unloving and abusive response?<br/>

&gt; The truth hurts. When I first started unschooling and started asking<br/>
&gt; questions. The answers sometimes made me cry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a journey for all of you. You&#39;re spending to much time worrying<br/>
&gt; about your sons future and what you want for him. If he has a hard<br/>
&gt; time with a friend. He needs maybe a hug and your support. He<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t need you to tell him everything he did wrong. I&#39;m sure he<br/>
&gt; knows. His extreme behavior, may always be somewhat extreme, as with<br/>
&gt; my son. He needs you to love him for who he is. How can he have<br/>
&gt; friends if he can&#39;t even find support in his family?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually it causes him trouble with his friends. Not with the adults<br/>
&gt; &gt; necessarily. When he freaks out and yells at a friend for something<br/>
&gt; &gt; that is a mistake or yells at a friend that &quot;I&#39;ll never play with you<br/>

&gt; &gt; help him be a happier person. What makes him happy is to have friends<br/>

really have to be done in a certain way or does it just have to have a<br/>

hear out of what I said.  When I said &quot;the truth hurts&quot;  I was<br/>
referring to everything that was said to help you that you argued or<br/>

   <br/>
      I completely understand this.  We are trying!! I think you need to muddle only over what you want and let go of the hurt you feel by words.  I don&#39;t think anyone was saying you are a horrible parent -- I think we ( I say we because that is how I have felt at times with various postings towards me -- and to tell the truth I haven&#39;t been posting too much on any group lately in fear of this...)  but I think what is reallllly happening is that you are not happy either with your response --hence why you posted for advice.    So as stated before -- chin up forgive your actions and know that you will make a better choice next time...<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  Hey if it makes you feel in better -- I screamed at my 5 year old today because I keep asking him not to pick on his brother (whose 2) and I just blew.  Not cool but I did -- so now we&#39;ve talked and I&#39;m back to reflecting how not to do that!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579593954">In another scenario, if you have the money to give<br/>
him for yard work, why don&#39;t you you just let him have it? <br/>
<br/>
********<br/>
<br/>
Exactly what I was thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I know my kids know I really don&#39;t have the money when I tell them I don&#39;t. That&#39;s the reality in a lot of homes. <br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t suddenly have the money if they do something I want them to do.<br/>
<br/>
If you want him to help you with the yardwork, why not just ask him to help? I don&#39;t have any sort of regular chores for anyone in the house but if I&#39;m trying to do something and need a hand, I ask. &quot;Hey, tall guy (everyone in this darned house is taller than me! :) ), could you reach that down from the shelf for me?&quot; &quot;Honey, could you please move the palm fronds out to the curb for the trash? (who knew they were so heavy??)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
More like I would ask anyone who was standing there for help. Not just because I can either withhold money or not.<br/>
<br/>
I just came home from picking up the nephew we babysit. As I was leaving, I told DD that there was a load of clothes in the dryer and it included some of her things. If she wanted something, she could get the load of laundry out. <br/>
<br/>
I see that she has dressed and did not take the clothes out of the dryer. So, eventually, I&#39;ll get to it. Or she will if she thinks of it. Or the baby and I will play &quot;laundry&quot; later -- not a method known for its efficiency, btw. :) <br/>
<br/>
But it wasn&#39;t DD&#39;s chore to take the laundry out of the dryer and it would have been insulting to her to suggest that I would pay her to do such a simple thing that&#39;s really just a matter of who needs the clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Too much info? :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Karen you are the only one who said you are a horrible parent. <br/>
<br/>
The folks on this list are trying to reflect how perhaps your reaction <br/>
made your son feel. They, or he did not say you were horrible. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes in our best efforts for our kids we get our own stuff wrapped <br/>
up in it.<br/>
<br/>
They, these unschooling mamas,are giving you feedback from an <br/>
unschooling perspective. If you were on a mainstream homeschooling <br/>
group the reaction would have been entirely different. But you asked <br/>
for an unschooling thought from radical unschooling folks. They have <br/>
lots of wisdom. NOT conventional thought, but what folks here have <br/>
determined to be a better choice for their families and kids. It is not <br/>
easy. It requires we look at things in a new light.<br/>
<br/>
No one here is personally attacking you. They are simply looking at the <br/>
situation from an unschooling or a child centered position and <br/>
reflecting that to you. That is what you asked for. It is NOT an attack <br/>
on you at all.<br/>
<br/>
You are a mother who loves her kid and wants what is best for him. No <br/>
one doubts that. The information shared on this list is for the benefit <br/>
of all of us. <br/>
<br/>
I sometimes get into some of the very same mindsets and need to be <br/>
shaken loose and refocused on what my philosophy and thoughts are on <br/>
parenting, homeschooling/unschooling and respect. I have to question <br/>
myself and my own learned reactions to get where I want to be.<br/>
<br/>
AND btw it is an ongoing process for all of us. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874245536">Hi, Karen - <br/>
<br/>
I want to invite you to take a deep, deep breath - 3 of them, in fact,<br/>
right from your tummy. Nice, slow breaths.<br/>
<br/>
I can see when you read &quot;he feels unsupported&quot; you heard &quot;he *is*<br/>
unloved&quot;. See the difference in those 2 statements? No one here is<br/>
saying you don&#39;t love your child. *He feels* unsupported and unheard.<br/>
He clearly told you that. Instead of beating your head against the<br/>
wall of &quot;But he is loved! He is supported! He should see that!&quot;, can<br/>
you try to see things from his view? Can you believe his words, and go<br/>
from there? Instead of pointing out to him how wrong his words are.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to challenge you to focus on the one issue you brought<br/>
here, him wanting something. Can you let go of fears about how his<br/>
friends treat him/he treats his friends for now? I *know* you feel<br/>
they&#39;re connected, that one thing leads to another. But I believe if<br/>
you can temporarily let go of *all* the other issues, and just focus<br/>
on this one thing - the exchange you had about him wanting something -<br/>
lots of clarity can come.<br/>
<br/>
Also - it would serve you, and your whole family, very well if you<br/>
drop the whole idea that it&#39;s your job to make everyone happy. I can&#39;t<br/>
write more about that now, but I hope someone else has time. This is<br/>
important. It is not your job to *make* anyone, and certainly not<br/>
everyone, happy.<br/>
<br/>
peace to you,<br/>

**First, it is not your job to &quot;make him happy all the time&quot; or &quot;keep everyone else happy all the time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am listening. I am trying to hear how to balance how to make him<br/>
happy all the time and keep everyone else happy all the time<br/>
especially when what he wants so often requires others not only to be<br/>
unhappy but miserable. Like when he tells his 9 yr old brother that<br/>
life would be better if he just died. That&#39;s not nice. And it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that John should be cuddled and loved on when he is<br/>
hateful to his brother. It&#39;s the hardest thing in the world for me to<br/>
figure out what to do when one of my kids hurts the other. <br/>
<br/>
**Maybe you&#39;ve told this story before and I didn&#39;t see it then but it does seem like a lot of scenes are being thrown into the discussion here -- all jumbled together -- and it sounds like you, Mom, are the one having a hard time. <br/>
<br/>
**Not to sound too condescending. . . I don&#39;t want to minimize how you feel when this sort of thing happens and you have the urge to &quot;fix&quot; it. But it is not your place to figure out what to do when one kid hurts another. You will never be able to come up with the &quot;just right&quot; phrase or rule that will prevent one brother from upsetting the other. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And FYI<br/>
that exchange followed Liam asking John not to throw his things. I<br/>
heard Liam ask him in a nice way. And he responds with wishing Liam<br/>
was dead??? And when I say that wasn&#39;t a nice thing to say he<br/>
responds with &quot;well he shouldn&#39;t get his feelings hurt by that I&#39;m<br/>
just expressing my feelings.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Karen<br/>
<br/>
**This is out of context for me as I don&#39;t know the whole story but I think it would get a &quot;don&#39;t be an asshole&quot; comment from me if anyone said that sort of thing to me. Someone has told John it is OK for him to &quot;express his feeling?&quot; Yep, that&#39;s OK. It is not OK to be cruel to others though. Or to hide behind saying it was &quot;just a joke.&quot; And people who do that should be called on it. <br/>
<br/>
**But that&#39;s not to say that John isn&#39;t a good person or that he needs to be &quot;changed&quot; or anything as disrespectful sounding as that. Maybe he just needs to have enough life experience to see that this sort of outburst is not productive. Maybe he will never be a diplomat. :) But he&#39;s only 11 and just figuring all of this out. <br/>
<br/>
**And if Mom hasn&#39;t figured it out yet -- and it does sound like many of these things upset you and you carry resentment about them -- when to let go and let kids sort things out themselves, when to accept one personality is not as adorable as the next, when to have hurt feelings about what a kid says and when to suck it up and realize he&#39;s just a kid -- imagine how hard it is for the 11-year-old in the picture. <br/>
<br/>
**Maybe a less stressful thing than saving for a vacation you can&#39;t afford would help? Maybe clear and repeated explanations about the rules on yardwork not being anyone&#39;s choice but the rules of the military? Maybe an acceptance than trying to live as unschoolers is not a perfect fit with the military but you are all in this together and trying to see how well you can all live together, for each other? <br/>
<br/>
**There is so much that comes out every time you post another snippet that it is hard to know what sort of input you want or need. But it doesn&#39;t sound to me that all of the issues are about being 11.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171150376">&quot;**Well here&#39;s the problem with this...we live on base. And the yard<br/>
work needs to be done THEIR way. Not mine. Not his. And if he&#39;s not<br/>
going to do it up to the code we&#39;ve agreed to abide by then he&#39;s not<br/>
really doing it and so there isn&#39;t any reason for me to pay him for<br/>
helping if he&#39;s going to do it his way. I&#39;m OK with the idea that<br/>
everything should be what and how he wants with his area, his body,<br/>
etc...but we do live with a set of rules and they have to be followed.<br/>
So if he&#39;s not going to do what the list asks for then he&#39;s not<br/>
really doing it. He could pick something else from the list I gave<br/>
him. AND I gave him the option of not doing anything at all. It was<br/>
a choice. Not a command disguised as a choice. But if he chooses to<br/>
help with the yard then he has to do what needs to be done. I don&#39;t<br/>
like the rule either but it is what it is.&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  I wonder if the rule about how the lawn has to be done is as rigid as you think. We&#39;ve lived on two bases and never kept the yard the way it was supposed to be kept all the time and never really had a problem. We got a few notices at the first base when the grass got too tall but we still never really got in any trouble. When I showed those to my ds he was much more willing to mow the lawn right away than when I nagged and nagged at him that it had to be done. Even then, though, it was never done perfectly but we never got any notices about that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-354727908">&quot;**OK well I had given a list of things he could choose from. And we<br/>
don&#39;t just have the money to give him. Plus he&#39;s very selfish,<br/>
(something I&#39;ve noticed but not said to him or anyone else.) And he<br/>
doesn&#39;t take very good care of his things unless he&#39;s worked to get<br/>
them. So I figured it would be good for him all around.<br/>
Additionally, he saved all his holiday money and bought himself<br/>
something he really wanted and it gave him a sense of pride about what<br/>
he had done. And that *is* good for him. So I figured this would be<br/>
good. I wish we had so much disposable income I could just hand them<br/>
100.00 and say &quot;have fun&quot; but we don&#39;t. As I mentioned I have to save<br/>
for things I want rather than need. I do jobs myself rather than pay<br/>
someone to do something or am very economical at the grocery to eek<br/>
out some little extra money. So no, just handing it over isn&#39;t really<br/>
an option and on top of it all we are saving to take them to Disney<br/>
(which they know about) in June for their Star Wars weekend. So<br/>
giving them each (I have two boys 9 and 11) 100.00 for a<br/>
skateboard/ripper thingy would cut into the vacation money. I suppose<br/>
I could give them the option of having one but not the other. Or<br/>
getting to go but no souveniers. I just think they will have more fun<br/>
at the Disney thing. (AND I discussed this with them and the 9 yr old<br/>
is willing to wait until his bday for his ripper 9 yr old DOB 9 Sept<br/>
11 yr old 15 Oct) Because the 9 yr old wants that Disney thing and<br/>
wants money to spend there. Like I said I wish we had it, but we<br/>
don&#39;t. I give them little bits of money here and there all the time.<br/>
But a big purchase like that is too much for me to swing as<br/>
disposable.&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  I see a lot in here about what YOU think is best or would be the most fun but not what your ds really wants. That could be very different. It can also be very different from what his brother wants. That doesn&#39;t make it any less valid.<br/>
   <br/>
  He&#39;s probably old enough that you could sit down with him and show him how your budget works, money vs. money out, how and where you save money by doing things yourself, how you pay yourself for those jobs. Then ask him if there are things he thinks he could do or cut back on to save the money for the thing he wants.<br/>

if you didn&#39;t, this wouldn&#39;t be a struggle. BUT his world, his <br/>

HUGE! Just as you are *perceiving* that you were told that you abuse <br/>
