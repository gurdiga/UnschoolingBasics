<div id="ygrps-yiv-426441552">Some in the &#39;educational&#39; communities actually are against &#39;invented&#39;<br/>
spelling but technically...weren&#39;t the words that are on a spelling<br/>
list &#39;invented&#39; at one time or another?  Has anyone ever seen a<br/>
Young&#39;s Literal Translation Bible?  HOLY MISSPELLINGS BATMAN!  LOL <br/>
Seriously, even though the words look strange to me, I can still<br/>
understand what they say.  And, in the same way, I&#39;ve never not been<br/>
able to understand a single word that my children have not spelled<br/>
&#39;correctly&#39;.  I can talk myself into seeing why spelling isn&#39;t a big<br/>
deal, I just wish society would stop being so darn stubborn with it.  <br/>
<br/>
I belonged to a website that had a few &#39;scholarly&#39; types on it who<br/>
were very hard on some posters for their spelling and grammar, a few<br/>
us defended those unable to meet the standards.  One 30 something when<br/>
writing would use &#39;their&#39; despite whether talking about a place or a<br/>
person.  However, ANYONE able to read would know which &#39;their&#39; he<br/>
meant even if he didn&#39;t use the proper and established way to spell<br/>
it, I mean, when someone is talking we don&#39;t ask them which<br/>
&#39;their/there&#39; spelling they use, Good GRAVY! <br/>
<br/>
Alright, I&#39;m done with my spelling rant.... :-)</div>

 </span></blockquote>Actually I&#39;ve never seen anything like that. I was amazed at how<br/>
easily I was able to read it even though none of it is spelled right!<br/>
That really changes my mind as to how important spelling *really* is.<br/>
