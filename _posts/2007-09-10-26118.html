<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290405018">I just got back from the Live & Learn conference (had an awesome time!!) and<br/>
decided to check my email to see what discussions I&#39;ve missed over the past<br/>
week. One posting on a statewide homeschooling list caught my eye - a mom<br/>
wrote that she&#39;s concerned her daughter is being selfish and spoiled. The<br/>
original posting and the many responses that followed (I stopped reading<br/>
after the first few) just seemed to GLARE off the page at me in big neon<br/>
letters. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m still riding on a conference high or because<br/>
I just spent a week in a big unschooling bubble, but the heartless and<br/>
manipulative flavor of the comments really struck a chord in me.<br/>
<br/>
They probably wouldn&#39;t have had quite the same impact on me two or three<br/>
years ago, not because I would have agreed with their approach, but because<br/>
the view expressed in these comments seemed like such a &quot;normal&quot; attitude to<br/>
have towards children. Reading just that one thread about the so-called<br/>
&quot;selfish&quot; daughter, I could see a lot of negative emotion being felt about<br/>
children. It occurs to me how prevalent and perfectly acceptable this<br/>
attitude is.<br/>
<br/>
It was really powerful indicator of how far down the RU path I&#39;ve come for<br/>
me to read the comments like the ones below and have such an intense<br/>
heart/gut reaction to them. I&#39;m ready to quit the list and pretend that<br/>
world doesn&#39;t exist, la lala la la lala (fingers in ears, I can&#39;t hear<br/>
you!). Has anyone else had this type of reaction? I&#39;ve been on this<br/>
particular list for years but it&#39;s never quite repulsed me in this way<br/>
before. I know it hasn&#39;t changed, it&#39;s me who&#39;s different, which I&#39;m<br/>
absolutely delighted about but at the same time I&#39;m saddened to now have the<br/>
ability to see how ugly the traditional parenting world can be.<br/>
<br/>
Since I can&#39;t be at special places like L&L everyday, I am more thankful<br/>
than ever to come home to the RU lists, where I am challenged to be a better<br/>
parent everyday. It&#39;s much better than stewing in this kind of ick and<br/>
allowing myself to accept/allow these type of harmful attitudes toward my<br/>
kids (or anyone else&#39;s kids for that matter). In light of the type of<br/>
comments and discussions on regular lists, it&#39;s extremely refreshing to be<br/>
present for the conversations here. Thanks to everyone who has provided a<br/>
plethora of ideas for me to think about, new (and improved!) tools for my<br/>
parenting basket, and has said just what I needed to hear, even when your<br/>
post wasn&#39;t directed at me.<br/>
<br/>
~ Susan<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3 separate comments that really twisted me up inside:<br/>
<br/>
My step-daughter Jess was very materialistic, and spoiled absolutely rotten.<br/>
 Whatever she wanted, she got, as long as her parents had the money for it.<br/>
I got the opportunity to show her the value of what she already had when we<br/>
had a battle of wills over her cleaning her room.  I told her that if it<br/>
wasn&#39;t done by 9:00 Thursday morning, I was going to clean it myself, and I<br/>
clean with a lot of garbage bags.  She didn&#39;t believe me. So when she got<br/>
home from after-school stuff that evening, her room was spotless.  She was<br/>
amazed, and thanked me profusely for cleaning it for her.  She was quite<br/>
happy, until she went to look for a CD, couldn&#39;t find it, and asked me where<br/>
it was.  &quot;In the garbage.&quot;  Her other CD&#39;s?  In the garbage.  The clothes<br/>
that were piled all over the place? Garbage. Everything that wasn&#39;t put away<br/>
neatly was in the garbage.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;NEEDS&#39; vs &#39;wants&#39;. I started trying to teach my cousins the difference many<br/>
many years ago (they are 5 and 10 years my junior). I always heard them say,<br/>
&quot;But I need a that new dress&quot;. I would say, they WANT it because all they<br/>
NEED is something that will keep them alive (water, food, you know). They<br/>
hated me at the time, but when we are together now, I don&#39;t hear the word<br/>
NEED :)<br/>
<br/>
He earns 6 dollars a week keeping his room clean and helping me around the<br/>
house if he wants extra cash for something he has to do even more....like<br/>
helping dad with the yard. It&#39;s very hard for me not to spoil my children<br/>
with &quot;things&quot; and I could see it becoming a negative thing where they were<br/>
expecting instead of thanking so now unless it&#39;s a special<br/>
occasion...birthday or holiday...they have to pay for it themselves. For<br/>
example he&#39;s dying for a Wii.... so far no Wii &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

<br/>
That was me when I came home from the conference last year! (and it has really stuck with me to this day).<br/>
<br/>
I quit the local homeschooling lists I was on - I saw many comments like the ones you posted.  The manipulative and domineering attitudes just sicked me.  I also cringe inwardedly whenever I&#39;m outside, as our neighborhood - and the one before it - are solely comprised of parents who are either completely authoritarian and/or neglectful.  The kids all gravitate to dh and me since we are out and involved with Tristan (ds), and their parents are no where to be seen for hours and hours.  That is, except, when they poke their heads out their doors to scream at their kids.  Tristan has a good friend who is constantly in trouble.  This boy was grounded from all video games because one night he was ten minutes late getting a shower and fixing his school lunch for the next day.  One day his mom also threw out his Nintendo DS and all games because he failed to clean his room.  This boy tries so hard to stay at our house as often and as long as possible.<br/>
<br/>
One comment I read recently, however, has really stuck with me.  A neighbor was talking about one of her daughters.  The night previously the little girl had corrected the her about something the she had said.  The mom relayed her displeasure by telling my next door neighbor, &quot;She doesn&#39;t know anything.  I&#39;M the adult.  She&#39;s just a kid.  They don&#39;t know anything.&quot;  And this was in hearing range of the child. (it shouldn&#39;t have been said at all, but....ggrrr...)  I don&#39;t know about y&#39;all, but my son has corrected me more times than I can count, and guess what?  He was absolutely right, and I was in the wrong.  Why can&#39;t people see that a child&#39;s view is just as valid as their own or, heaven forbid, that they may be knowledgeable about something the parent is not? *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
I am so thankful for this list and unschooling in general.  It has given me such insight and has really opened my eyes to a whole new (wonderful!) world for my family, but at the same time it just breaks my heart to see how so many other families live.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328339689">Yes, this happened after we had some unschooling friends visit for a <br/>
couple days and attended a small unschooling gathering with them. The <br/>
mom had so much respect for her children, and all four of our kids got <br/>
along SO well. It was beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
 I am often quite amazed at what parents will say and do and truly <br/>
believe it is rational and will help the situation. Not only unkind <br/>
things but completely nonsensical. I try to remember sometimes that that <br/>
was me once(and still can be in a confused moment). I really do need to <br/>
preserve relationships with other parents for the sake of my kids.<br/>
<br/>
What bother me the most are families that says they are unschooling, and <br/>
then proceed to speak about their kids in such a negative way, so <br/>
disappointed with what the kids spend their time doing (playing video <br/>
games, usually), rather than really taking the time to see what they are <br/>
doing, and angry with them for not doing things such as remembering to <br/>
pack their own lunch (I guess the parent thinks that unschooled kids are <br/>
supposed to always be responsible for their own needs and that they will <br/>
learn from going hungry?  I see it as my job to make sure they have what <br/>
they need, and if they decide to do it themselves, then great, and they <br/>
will-  my mom isn&#39;t making my lunches anymore, though my grandmother was <br/>
making lunch for my uncle when he was 30(he wasn&#39;t unschooled).) I <br/>
recommend Sandra and Joyce&#39;s websites often. I suppose these families <br/>
are unschooling in some way but it stops after reading and math, and <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem very fun.<br/>
<br/>
I try to only say what my experience is as I don&#39;t want to seem <br/>
annoying, and as I said, these are parents of my kid&#39;s friends and I <br/>
can&#39;t afford to alienate, though I am afraid I do just by being myself <br/>
and being positive and excited about my kids, rather than grumpy and <br/>
complaining. I think they might think I just have exceptional kids and <br/>
are resentful of this.  Often just keeping the subject on something else <br/>
entirely or knitting is the only way to cope.<br/>
<br/>
Reading unschooling lists has become more important to me, though maybe <br/>
someday I can go to a conference and see some real faces. My daughter <br/>
doesn&#39;t enjoy traveling much, so it might have to wait until she is <br/>
happy to stay home with her Dad-(in addition to having the extra money.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446914343">This happens to me all the time. I get really bent when I see moms in public <br/>
or in my neighborhood being so tough on their kids. When any kids are at my <br/>
house, they get some unschooling. It is nice to be able to see kids getting <br/>
some freedoms that don&#39;t get elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I went to a neighbors to borrow some flour and their daughter was <br/>
in trouble. The mother brought me into the conversation and humiliated her <br/>
daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I asked if I could see her room. This girl is very good friends with my <br/>
daughter and I was telling her how similar our houses were built. She <br/>
happily invited me up even though her mothers face looked stressed about the <br/>
idea. Her room was a disaster. I noticed a trophy on the floor and asked her <br/>
about it. We discussed a beautiful pillow had Aunt made for her. We talked <br/>
for a good 15 minutes sitting in the mess. We just plopped down on her <br/>
mattress and I listened mostly.<br/>
<br/>
As I was leaving her mom walked me out and thanked me for talking to her <br/>
daughter because she seemed so much more calm now. I don&#39;t know what she <br/>
think we talked about, I didn&#39;t even mention the issue they were fighting <br/>
about and acted like her room was immaculate. This girl just needed some <br/>
love.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735450619">I think a lot of us have had these experiences, and for me, they get more<br/>
and more grating the further we get into unschooling.  And my belief in<br/>
unschooling is nudging me to somehow engage these people.  This is tough for<br/>
me, having a very hands-off, live-by-example style of proselytizing for ANY<br/>
form of religion, politics or parenting style, no matter how fervently<br/>
believed in.  Soooo, answering some sticky questions becomes necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Under what circumstances make it OK to &quot;engage&quot; someone?<br/>
<br/>
Once engaged, HOW should it be gone about?<br/>
<br/>
Obviously context and situation heavily influence these answers.  Obviously,<br/>
whatever happens should be done with love and respect.  But that doesn&#39;t<br/>
give me any how-tos, no examples, etc.  NVC  (Non-Violent Communication, by<br/>
Marshall Rosenberg) has worked for me when I&#39;ve found myself in a conflict<br/>
with someone else, but I don&#39;t remember if it actually has ideas/examples<br/>
about initiating, especially when it doesn&#39;t directly involve me.  Insertion<br/>
is what would be trickiest.<br/>
<br/>
Just some of my own thoughts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I am feeling this, too. I wanted to write back and post my own response<br/>
to that thread but I got muddled down in trying to figure out how to do it<br/>
in a way that wouldn&#39;t immediately offend the posters of those comments. I<br/>
know if they went on the offensive they wouldn&#39;t really read what I wrote,<br/>
it would just be dismissed. RU lists are much more direct and that&#39;s part of<br/>
what I love about them and part of what helps me &quot;get it&quot; but it&#39;s a<br/>
departure from how most lists run. The approach used here would be written<br/>
off as &quot;rude&quot; or &quot;attacking&quot; on traditional lists. If I wrote what I really<br/>
wanted to I know lots of people would just jump to defend the original<br/>
posters POV and my comments would get buried and the whole thing would be<br/>
pointless. So I ended up talking myself out of it.<br/>
<br/>
Dayna Martin gave a presentation at L&L about advocating for unschooling. I<br/>
couldn&#39;t make it to her talk but I plan to download it from the website<br/>
later. Not sure what all it encompassed, but maybe she had some ideas for<br/>
those of us who want to speak up but aren&#39;t sure how to do it effectively.<br/>
<br/>
A year or so ago I was at a playground with the kids and had brought along<br/>
my dog-eared copy of Unconditional Parenting. A couple nearby was watching<br/>
their son playing with my son and we struck up a conversation. They asked if<br/>
I&#39;d ever read &quot;The Strong Willed Child&quot; by James Dobson. I said I had not,<br/>
but the name sounded familiar to me. They gave a glowing review of the book,<br/>
saying it really helped them &quot;break&quot; their son&#39;s will and that the spankings<br/>
and other &quot;discipline&quot; tactics recommended in the book had made him<br/>
obedient. I think their son was 3 1/2.<br/>
<br/>
I remember standing there, shocked, looking down at my very different sort<br/>
of book, which admittedly wasn&#39;t perfect and didn&#39;t contain all the answers<br/>
but had served as a stepping stone on my path to RU, and kind of panicking<br/>
inside, thinking I really wanted to say something to these people but I<br/>
didn&#39;t even know where to begin. Part of me was furious at this James Dobson<br/>
person for writing such crappy advice and touting it to desperate parents,<br/>
part of me was angry at this couple for not thinking about what they were<br/>
doing or being able to see how awful it was, and part of me was feeling<br/>
extremely sad for their son.<br/>
<br/>
Before they left I managed to croak out, &quot;We steer away from philosophies<br/>
that advocate spanking&quot; which seemed to surprise them a bit but wasn&#39;t<br/>
really earth-shaking and not a tenth of what I really wanted to say. When I<br/>
got home I looked up the James Dobson book and found a page about it at<br/>
stoptherod.com - and it was every bit as horrible as I&#39;d feared. I really,<br/>
really wish I&#39;d handed them my well-worn book and said, &quot;Here&#39;s something<br/>
that&#39;s worked for us, it&#39;s a different approach but I think it helps create<br/>
happier families.&quot; I&#39;ve thought about that encounter a lot and had<br/>
conversations in my head about what I could have said. I guess it&#39;s good<br/>
practice for my next face-to-face.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-566627645">The key for me is to respond to ANYone -- be it face-to-face, on some<br/>
mailing lists, or however -- with respect.  This means believing that these<br/>
people really are doing what they think is best, no matter how backward and<br/>
damaging it seems to me.  They really do care.  They just have very poor<br/>
tools and/or a really wacked-out POV.  In other words, they&#39;re not really<br/>
Evil.  (In different terms, it would be separating the sin from the<br/>
sinner.)  Once I can get to this point, my blood pressure drops just enough<br/>
so I can think better.<br/>
<br/>
So far, the rules I&#39;ve played by are, &quot;If they bring it up, it&#39;s fair game,&quot;<br/>
and &quot;When in the game, play gently.&quot; (I&#39;m interested in getting more people<br/>
to play, more often.)  These rules work when already discussing something in<br/>
a friendly conversation.  People seem reluctant to allow a pleasant<br/>
situation to deteriorate.<br/>
<br/>
Discussing parenting styles has actually come up a few times with other<br/>
parents, and there&#39;s only been one testy little exchange, but nothing out of<br/>
hand.  Usually, someone will say something, expecting that I agree with<br/>
them.  I do not have (much of) a problem gently disavowing them of that<br/>
notion, while at the same time letting them know that I&#39;m open to<br/>
discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Modulating back the judgment, shock or other strong emotions can be<br/>
difficult, but so far it&#39;s the only way I&#39;ve found to facilitate<br/>
communication.  And self-righteousness shuts down communication faster than<br/>
a squirrel on coffee.<br/>
<br/>
A huge portion of my reticence to initiate conversation is this:  just the<br/>
audacity and arrogance to believe that I would know better than someone<br/>
else, or would presume to know at a glance how to solve long-standing<br/>
problems gives me pause.  I&#39;m not all-knowing.  I&#39;m just a human being.<br/>
What right, what authority do I have to tell someone that they could be<br/>
doing it so much better?  Nevertheless, I&#39;m still getting prodded to<br/>
engage.<br/>
<br/>
Now, having said all that, I then feel like a hypocrite for being Mr. Calm<br/>
when I see a parents yelling and berating their children.  The guilt trip,<br/>
the Big Voice, the threats.  The &quot;I clean with a garbage sack.&quot;  Should I be<br/>
calm in the face of this?  Should I engage quietly yet respectfully?  Or<br/>
should I call them out, possibly risking them running further away from what<br/>
I&#39;m trying to tell them?<br/>
<br/>
So, is the seminar on advocacy on the L&L website?  I&#39;ll go trawling for it<br/>
this evening.  I&#39;m very interested in anything that might help me move<br/>
beyond passive advocacy.<br/>

belief that to be an advocate for unschooling, she needed to BE<br/>
unschooling while out in public, etc.  She talked about remaining calm<br/>

planning on downloading it, too, even though I was there - there was a<br/>

<br/>
This is one of the only national unschooling lists I&#39;m on - I felt<br/>
like since it&#39;s &quot;basics&quot;, it wouldn&#39;t get nasty and judgmental like so<br/>
many of the other lists do.  It&#39;s hard to believe that anyone so quick<br/>
to condemn is actually living an unschooling life. (of course, I can<br/>
hear *my own* judgment in this statement!)  Dayna captured that<br/>
sentiment very well.<br/>

but it is a little frustrating when I can&#39;t make it clear that all kids <br/>
could be like that- enthusiastic and committed to what they are doing <br/>
and respectful.<br/>
<br/>
I have actually started to think that in my particular area, it might be <br/>
a bad thing for my kids for me to be an advocate for unschooling, as it <br/>
sets them aside as different from families and kids they would like to <br/>
fit in with. The schooled people we know know very little of what we do, <br/>
and around school at home families I, at this point, almost (but not <br/>
quite) wish that I had kept our lifestyle more quiet. I fear that it may <br/>
make some parents wary of letting their kids be close to ours. The no <br/>
limits on &quot;screens&quot; is, I think, a hard one for many to stomach.<br/>
<br/>
I often tell stories of how for example, my kids learned to read on <br/>
their own, when the subject of reading comes up. I tell people who ask <br/>
about all the interesting things my kids do, or about how our <br/>
relationship has improved since I read this book, or read that website, <br/>
whatever(this is a simplification, of course, as it is not one thing.)  <br/>
Sometimes I think parents would prefer someone to complain with though, <br/>
rather than hear how it is better or easier in my family or could be <br/>
better in theirs. It is easier to make it the kids fault than to take <br/>
responsibility for how things aren&#39;t so good in your family and make a <br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
However, the relationship is what is always important, rather than me <br/>
proving I am right.  If people see I am a kind and reasonable person <br/>
first, then discover  other things about our family as it comes out <br/>
through conversation, then that works better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112393935">I feel like I run into Insanity so often that I&#39;ve started just <br/>
expecting it. I often feel like a tourist in a foreign country, and <br/>
in that sense, I usually find it amusing and fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
But when it&#39;s meanness to their kids, it just makes me very sad.<br/>
<br/>
One of many many examples: I was at Breakfast with Santa last <br/>
December with my three children. A lady I didn&#39;t know, sitting by me, <br/>
was nice enough to hold my baby while I got myself and the other two <br/>
kids fed. She was very nice and pleasant. I asked her about her <br/>
children, and she introduced me to one child. Then she said her two <br/>
year old had to stay home because she was being difficult, or <br/>
disobedient, or something, at bedtime the night before.<br/>
<br/>
It made me feel kind of sad and sick. <br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on with stories like that. I guess we all could.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my reaction varies. This particular woman seemed quite <br/>
pleased and confident with her decsion, she was a total stranger, and <br/>
she was helping me out, so I didn&#39;t address it.<br/>
<br/>
What works best for me is to take opportunities to tap into <br/>
frustrations that are already there. For example, someone was telling <br/>
me about putting their kids in Time Out. I said, &quot;Oh, does that <br/>
help?&quot; She immediately said, &quot;No.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Or I might say, &quot;Oh, I&#39;ve found that what helps when my child acts <br/>
like that is to ____.&quot; That&#39;s is the person seems frustrated. If they <br/>
seem confident in what they&#39;re doing, I&#39;m more likely to either <br/>
ignore it or ask sort of innocent questions.<br/>
<br/>
As far as on-line homeschool (and not unschool) groups, I don&#39;t think <br/>
I have any use for them. I visted one recently that I thought might <br/>
be appropriate for me. One post said that when their child won&#39;t be <br/>
their &quot;schoolwork,&quot; they will make them scrub all the toilets, saying <br/>
to them, &quot;If you don&#39;t do your math, when you&#39;re an adult you&#39;ll be <br/>
scrubbing other people&#39;s toilets.&quot; Others replied that that was <br/>
clever and great!<br/>
<br/>
I see no reason for me to be there. Discussions like that won&#39;t help <br/>
me, and I&#39;m doubt I would help them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-635588279"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So, is the seminar on advocacy on the L&L website?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe the round table chats/discussions were not recorded,<br/>
although there was a mic being passed around at Dayna&#39;s chat, so you<br/>
may end up being in luck.  However, it may take the volunteers a while<br/>
to get home and settled before taking on the task of uploading the MP3s.</div>
