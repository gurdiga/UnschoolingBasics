<div id="ygrps-yiv-696094024">Hi there!<br/>
<br/>
       I just wanted to share an observation with all those newbies out<br/>
there, including myself.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not anything new to you<br/>
&#39;oldtimers&#39; though. :)<br/>
<br/>
     I&#39;ve only been &#39;basically&#39; unschooling my son for about three months<br/>
now and I&#39;ve noticed something amazing.  His natural curiosity has<br/>
kicked into overdrive.   It seemed to go dormant for the 2 1/2 years<br/>
that he was in school and now my husband and I are constantly being<br/>
assaulted by  those wonderful &#39;why&#39; questions that make us scratch our<br/>
heads and run for the library!<br/>

<br/>
Makes a laptop with Internet access almost a necessity, doesn&#39;t it? All<br/>
those &quot;why&quot; questions. I still remember when DS was about 6 or so and he<br/>
just wanted to know why windows are called &quot;windows&quot; and so on - not<br/>
only did I show him how to read the etymology info in the dictionary if<br/>
he so chose (I could do it if he wanted me to, sometimes he wanted to do<br/>
it himself) but I found a wonderful etymology website that we all love<br/>
to use to look stuff up, added it as a bookmark to his computer - us<br/>
&quot;edumakated gr&#39;ups&quot; learned lots too!<br/>
 <br/>
They also make for great discussion of possibilities questions - why do<br/>
you think it&#39;s called a window? (as I&#39;m humming the abcs thumbing<br/>
through the dictionary because I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s called that<br/>
either).<br/>

That&#39;s pretty cool, huh? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It took a long while for Cameron&#39;s curiosity and creativity to kick in, <br/>
but it was SUCH a pleasure to watch!<br/>
<br/>
After biting my nails for 18 months,... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations!<br/>
