<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935011098">&quot;Do the kids come with me to the opening ceremony speech<br/>
at 2?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sure!!:)<br/>
The only request at most of these conferences, is that parents leave<br/>
with any children that are having a hard time being quiet. It&#39;s very<br/>
distracting for the speakers to have a lot of noise.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent all of the conferences dabbling in and out of talks,<br/>
because of having my wee one with me.:) It&#39;s still great.<br/>
