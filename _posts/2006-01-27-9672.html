<div id="ygrps-yiv-427874334">someone posted that the date for this program is tonight JAN 30th.  There<br/>
was a misunderstanding on the date that was posted before.<br/>
<br/>
so you can&#39;t find the transcripts because the show hasn&#39;t been run yet.<br/>

reporters that got shot. I was kind of glad - it would&#39;ve been a bit <br/>
odd having a story on unschooling fall right after the ones on <br/>
underage prostitutes and all that stuff as if to lump it in with <br/>
abusing children. It&#39;ll pop up one of these days - once the real news <br/>
slows down some.<br/>

nobody seems to be jumping up and down saying &quot;You gotta air this - <br/>
it&#39;s really important!&quot; From a national news standpoint, not to <br/>
mention international news, it&#39;s really a non-issue except insofar as <br/>
the established system finds it threatening.<br/>
