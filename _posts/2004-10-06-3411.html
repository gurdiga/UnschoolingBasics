<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212271964">Hi guys.  When I first came on this list, stating that I thought TV was evil (which I definitely no longer believe; thanks ya&#39;ll) and that we would never get cable, Rue (I think it was Rue) asked me &quot;well, what if he wants cable?&quot; <br/>
So, let me share this incident that happened today.  We were at Wal-Mart and Will saw a display of TVs.  He said &quot;Buy me one of those TVs.&quot;  I said, &quot;we already have a TV!&quot; and he replied, &quot;No, I want a TV for my room.&quot;  I said, &quot;Okay, well mama doesn&#39;t have enough money to buy a new TV, but would you like to move the TV we already have into your playroom?&quot;  He said yes and we did just that as soon as we got home.  He turned it on, started turning the channels and got MAD, and screamed, &quot;I DON&#39;T WANT THIS TV: I WANT AN ANIMAL PLANET TV!&quot;  So, obviously the child wants cable!  We are moving in a couple of weeks and I am hoping this will make the move better for him...I called today and ordered DirectTV at our new home.  It will be already hooked up when we move in.<br/>
Just wanted to share.<br/>
Peace and all good,<br/>
Millie<br/>

We just got direct tv and we love it.  The kids watch PBS Kids all day  and <br/>
night.<br/>
 <br/>
I does go out in the rain.  When the tv goes out they come running  &quot;it&#39;s <br/>
raining, it&#39;s raining!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Have fun!<br/>

whole reason we got direct tv in the first place<br/>

When we moved here (Allen, TX), we had to pay for cable for the first time in years.  So, we got Comcast.  Bleck! The first day, Margaux was so happy to see her old favorite channels.  Then two days later, they switched their line-up and she lost every single kid channel, except PBS and she is a late sleeper, so misses most of the kid shows.  We&#39;re researching the best satellite company to go with now.  It&#39;s a bummer, though.  Cable television is only 3 dollars more than cable internet if you buy them together.  :o(  Not looking forward to paying $85 month for satellite, but we&#39;re going to do it.  The channels are just too good!  My husband is a world news fanatic, and Margaux will have all the neat kids channels.  <br/>

<br/>
When we first got DirecTV (so dh could watch Philly Eagles games here <br/>
in DC!), it went out whenever it rained even a little. I was <br/>
disgusted at how much money we were paying for something that worked <br/>
so poorly! They weren&#39;t any help, saying that, yeh, it goes out when <br/>
it rains. Well, then fall came and the leaves fell off all the trees <br/>
in the neighborhood and presto! Then the service only went out when <br/>
it poured. So in spring, when we started having problems again (due, <br/>
apparently, to leaves getting heavy with rain, bringing the branches <br/>
down in the way of our dish), dh stood outside in the rain and moved <br/>
the dish until it started working again.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, this might help someone, somewhere...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-562659792">continuing from all the other cable posts....  We just got a Replay TV DVR<br/>
(like  aTiVo).  We LOVE it!!  I used to be really irritated by the noise of<br/>
the TV being on so much, and now that we have the DVR ds fast forwards<br/>
through all the commercials and I realized it was the commercials that were<br/>
driving me nuts.  Also, we have it set to record anything ds likes to watch,<br/>
so he feels free to choose to do whatever he wants since he knows his<br/>
favorite shows will always be waiting for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098317352">could also be location - partial blockages by buildings, trees, etc...<br/>
dropping signal strength, also DC is close to Sea Level - I don&#39;t know<br/>
if that has an effect or not.  DC does have an airport though, and TV<br/>
dishes can pick up interference from their radar).<br/>
