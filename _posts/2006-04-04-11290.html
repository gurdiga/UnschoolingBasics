 </span></blockquote>You have to look back at the medieval university.  Yep, it all started<br/>
almost 700 years ago!  To enter the medieval university (which is quite<br/>
different from how it is today.  If we had universities like they had back<br/>
then today I might have truly enjoyed my university experience!)  you had to<br/>
take very difficult oral and written exams.  They did this to keep the<br/>
&quot;peasants&quot; from being able to attend the universities.  They did it as part<br/>
of weeding out &quot;certain people.&quot;  The sad thing is that if your daddy had<br/>
enough money you could know squat and get in (does that remind you of<br/>
anyone?) Learning Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, and  German was a<br/>
way of distancing oneself from lower masses even if you never had any use<br/>
for those languages.<br/>
<br/>
Some things from the medieval university stayed with us.  One being entrance<br/>
exams.  For some reason there is this thought that our children need to be<br/>
&quot;well rounded&quot; to succeed.  Tell that to Einstein, Shakespeare (who was<br/>
horrible at math!), Galileo, Edison, Carver, Currie!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why does this country have to make things so difficult for people to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be educated in areas of interest only, meaning they can still be<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, never have used any of that calculus in theatre arts. At least not the<br/>
way it was taught.  I probably have used some of it in problem solving, but<br/>
it was for real and physical problems, not theoretic problems!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say that this why I still am not able to let go of making<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a lovely (albeit a tad frightening) book called The Fifth Sacred<br/>
Thing by Starhawk.  You probably would have to look in the New Age or Occult<br/>
sections to find it.  It is a novel based in the future of a community that<br/>
lives where everyone&#39;s talents are praised and revered.  Healers heal<br/>
because that&#39;s what they want to do.  Artists create because they want to<br/>
create.  Healers and artists are considered equal.  It is a socialist based<br/>
society, so no one goes hungry or without basic needs met.  Everyone from<br/>
the healers to the artists from the clothiers to the teachers all help with<br/>
the &quot;distateful tasks&quot; like emptying composting toilets, pulling weeds, and<br/>
taking care of the children or very elderly.  children have as much of a<br/>
right to speak at community meetings as adults.  I want to live in that<br/>
community (sans all the nasty things that happen outside their city walls.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-32629628">I&#39;m new here on the list, in fact I&#39;m new to this country, new to  homescholing and new to unschooling. We came from Germany just a couple  of months ago where homeschooling, nevermind unschooling, is illegal.  The police comes to  fetch your child to bring it to school, if he  doesn&#39;t turn up. After four years in elementary school the children are  separated into three (to four) types of school, one for the brightest  (with a college future), the next for the not so bright (with a not so  easy access to college), after that you can&#39;t even try for any &quot;higher&quot;  education, if you&#39;ve attended any of the other schools. And this  happens when the children are 10 years of age. It&#39;s ridiculous! <br/>
  <br/>
  It&#39;s a long and hard political struggle to try and set up an  alternative school, it&#39;s frowned upon by most people and especially  anyone who has had teacher training (they consider themselves better  equipped to know what&#39;s good for the children). We&#39;ve tried  nevertheless, and the rest of the group is still going ahead with that  school at home. If I had had a chance to just leave my kids at home and  let them learn whatever comes their way and interest, I would have been  more than happy. I was amazed that I could do this so easily here and  that there is so much (cyber or not) support and so many people around  who do the same thing (at least homeschooling). My way of thinking  about learning and education was just so unheard of and not taken  seriously by so many people. In that respect I find it a relief to be  here.<br/>
  <br/>
  I follow the discussions on the list with great interest and hope to be able to contribute some time.<br/>
