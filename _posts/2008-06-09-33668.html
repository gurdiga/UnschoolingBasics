 The below remided me of the first essay  from David Albert&#39;s Homeschooling and the Voyage of Self-Discovery  It can be vieewed here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.skylarksings.com/readessay.php?id=5%c2%a0">http://www.skylarksings.com/readessay.php?id=5%c2%a0</a> <br/>
Talks about kids as Distinguished Visitors who need help with social cues, among other things, and our job as hosts is to do just that, with the understanding that they will not do everything the way that we do because they are different people from a different time.  I loved reading this and it&#39;s such a good reminder of what our role is and should be.<br/>

&gt; Everyone is that way to some extent. Some need more help reading<br/>
&gt; social cues than others.<br/>

&gt; Autistic kids need a lot more help. But it *is* help that an aware<br/>
&gt; empowered parent can give to a child. (Fresh ideas from other parents<br/>
&gt; who feel empowered to help them start thinking outside the<br/>
&gt; conventional parenting box can be very useful!)<br/>
