<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386584541">Hi all.My husband just gave me the money to buy  school books for the <br/>
rest of the year.We have been using a &quot;self-paced &quot; curriculum for <br/>
many,many years.<br/>
What would you buy if you were going to become unschoolers? My <br/>
husband is kinda cheap when it comes to money and I might not get <br/>
this chance again......(haha)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189195597">I wouldn&#39;t spend it all at once--when there&#39;s too many<br/>
new things my eyes tend to glaze over, and so do my<br/>
kids.  Break it up into months, maybe, and spent it on<br/>
monthly trips to the bookstore, toy store, zoo, etc? <br/>
Is there extra money for fun things like bowling and<br/>
soccer and skiing lessons, or is that included in<br/>
this, too?  Ask your kids what they want and include<br/>
them in the shopping, of course!<br/>

Hi  all.My husband just gave me the money to buy  school books for the  <br/>
rest of the year.We have been using a &quot;self-paced &quot; curriculum for  <br/>
many,many years.<br/>
What would you buy if you were going to become  unschoolers? My <br/>
husband is kinda cheap when it comes to money and I might  not get <br/>
this chance again......&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d buy memberships to every cool thing in town----the zoo, museums,  science <br/>
centers. Maybe season theatre/symphony tickets.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d find a local Usborne representative and go through their catalogue with  <br/>
the kids (you could spend all your money there, if you&#39;re not careful!).<br/>
 <br/>
Magnet sets and dice (many-sided, too!). Tangrams. CD&#39;s---like Jim Weiss&#39;  <br/>
stories on CD as well as music. Games like Set, Five Crowns, Boggle, Apples to  <br/>
Apples. OH!---Those Cooperative Games out of Canada! (anybody got a link?)<br/>
 <br/>
Paper. Lots and lots of paper. Staples has recyled packs sometimes for like  <br/>
$3/pack. Markers and gel pens and colored pencils. Stickers. Good child-sized  <br/>
scissors.<br/>
 <br/>
Magazine subscriptions.<br/>
 <br/>
Computer games like Zoombinis and Sims. A video gaming system, if you don&#39;t  <br/>
already have one and the kids want one----with games, of course.<br/>
 <br/>
Yu-Gi-Oh! or Pokemon cards----lots of them if that&#39;s what they&#39;re  into.<br/>
 <br/>
A lot of what you get would depend on the children, their ages, and their  <br/>
interests.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Jeanne...you&#39;re close to Jacksonville I think?  I&#39;d buy a season pass  to <br/>
MOSH or the zoo.  I think you&#39;re fairly close to both.   Then  I&#39;d save the rest <br/>
and see what the kids want to do.  Maybe you could all go  to Hannah Park for <br/>
the day.  With all these almost 80 degree days, we  sometimes just need gas <br/>
money to head out and explore the beach.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d definitely use it to get out of the house some and do some special  <br/>
excursions.  There are so many places around here to explore.  We&#39;re  planning a <br/>
day to see the manatees if it ever gets cold again.  Send me an  e-mail and <br/>
maybe we can meet and go to Blue Springs together!<br/>

Thanks for the link, Karen!  They have 2 games that you can play online <br/>
and I started playing the listening game at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cooperativegames.ca/play.htm#">http://www.cooperativegames.ca/play.htm#</a> and before long my DS came to <br/>
see what those sounds were.  We played it together and did all 10 <br/>
levels.  Fun!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425459251">I will have to check out the website...I didnt realize they had games <br/>
online.  The ad caught my eye because we have been playing some of <br/>
the new games from xmas and I was thinking it would be nice to get <br/>
some that will help to limit the competitiveness.  My kids are just 5 <br/>
and 7 and it can get heated. :)<br/>
