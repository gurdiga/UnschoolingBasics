<div id="ygrps-yiv-353446656">I read regularly and have gotten some great advice here.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Our DD has down syndrome, she will be 3 next month.  I was looking <br/>
over some developmental guidelines to get some ideas to keep her <br/>
moving along.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like thinking in these terms, but she isn&#39;t a typical child <br/>
and I get nervous.  But I don&#39;t want to make things lessons for her.<br/>
<br/>
I need ideas for basic concepts.  Matching, colors, photo <br/>
recognition, that sort of thing.  Today we tried matching colored <br/>
buttons with her stacking cups.  No go - she just wanted to dump and <br/>
pour them.<br/>
<br/>
I just worry, I never sat and taught DS stuff like this.  I just <br/>
worry with DD I don&#39;t know why.  The reading I have done says <br/>
children with Ds don&#39;t learn incidentally.  Is that just because <br/>
they have all been force fed?  Is she just not ready for these <br/>
concepts?  <br/>
<br/>
It is really hard - when everyone raves about preschool and peer <br/>
modeling.  I know I don&#39;t want that for her, but how much do I have <br/>
to push to help her be her best?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for all the questions, I am mostly thinking outloud.  Hoping <br/>
to explain what I am asking.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t believe this.  Problem is that most schools are truly pushing DS kids to function like typical children.  The other problem is that in the past DS people were pushed to the background and warehoused.  Unschooling couldn&#39;t be further from either of those things.  Play with her.  Enjoy her.  Take her with you and engage her in everything you do.  She will learn.<br/>
<br/>
I used to work at what was basically a nursing home for profoundly retarded youngsters.  Those kids learned a lot that was never &quot;taught&quot; to them.  One knew how to drive the techs crazy by blowing out his feeding tube plug right after they put in when he was finished eating....what a mess but he loved it.  Another had very, very limited speech but what he could say was &quot;Dr. Pepper, please.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I need ideas for basic concepts. Matching, colors, photo recognition, that<br/>
sort of thing. Today we tried matching colored buttons with her stacking<br/>
cups. No go - she just wanted to dump and pour them.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there.  Finding things that may attract her attention and that would<br/>
be fun for her is great.  Good job.  When she finds something else to do<br/>
with the stuff you got out, that&#39;s good.  Go with it.  Dumping and pouring<br/>
out of cups is an excellent activity for little kids to engage in.  Heck,<br/>
3yos in expensive Montessori schools do it for hours.  She came up with that<br/>
activity so it&#39;s what she needs to learn and do right now.  Join in.  Have<br/>
fun.  Colors will come some other time when you least expect them.  Really<br/>
truly they will.   When they do, you can be ready to play with her happily<br/>
there too.    <br/>
<br/>
So keep bringing in stuff to broaden her world and her understanding but if<br/>
she finds something to do with the stuff that isn&#39;t what you had in mind,<br/>
celebrate.  Take notice. *That&#39;s* when real learning is taking place.  <br/>
<br/>
It might help you to talk to other parents who&#39;s kids also have Downs and<br/>
are a little older.  I&#39;ll bet all their kids learned all the things people<br/>
call &quot;toddler concepts&quot; when they were ready.  You might try Anne Ohman&#39;s<br/>
yahoogroup &quot;shine with unschooling&quot; if you&#39;re not already on that for some<br/>
reassurance.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/</a><br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm....Anne&#39;s list isn&#39;t for discussing &quot;special needs&quot;, though.  It<br/>
is for talking about how *all* children shine with unschooling and<br/>
celebrating their unique gifts.  Parents are told to leave labels at<br/>
the door when joining the Shine list.  <br/>
<br/>
So if she needs help seeing past the label and accepting and<br/>
celebrating who her daughter is right now, the list would help, but<br/>
not so much if she is searching for ideas for how to do at-home<br/>
therapy or developmental activities.<br/>
<br/>
Your suggestions, though, Krisula, are the same as what she would find<br/>
on Shine...to enjoy her daughter right now, and participate in those<br/>
activities her daughter is drawn to, trusting that she will seek out<br/>
what she needs when she is ready.<br/>
