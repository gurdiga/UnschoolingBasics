Are you keeping a journal? That&#39;s a really good idea so you can look <br/>
at changes in food and behavior with a little more objectivity - <br/>
don&#39;t just notice foods, but other factors, sleep, people, your own <br/>
mood. Talk with her about all of this - does she *feel* a <br/>
difference? Keep track of good, mellow, happy times, too and see if <br/>
there&#39;s a pattern there - maybe she needs *more* of something.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d examine the sugar issue more closely - corn syrup is a more <br/>
likely culprit, as are dyes. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d look to add things that are good for her to eat *before* trying <br/>
to eliminate anything. Start by giving more opions, not less. That <br/>
will give you more things to compare and talk about, too - I notice <br/>
you seem grouchy when you eat xyz, but not when you eat this other <br/>
brand - do you notice a difference?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044222421">We did a dairy elimination diet in Dec and Jan, finally concluded it wasn&#39;t our culprit and gradually reintroduced.  My 7yo&#39;s anger and aggression were bad enough at the time that my 10yo was more than willing to try the diet.  My younger two, 7 and then almost 4, objected but I have to admit I over-ruled it given the intensity of the situation.  (Seriously, I had a couple times when I thought I&#39;d have to call 911.)  However, I made sure to have lots of special foods -- things I wouldn&#39;t normally get, often because of cost (I just decided that at the moment, trying the diet was more important than money).  And we rid the whole house of dairy so it just wasn&#39;t available as a choice.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, what has seemed to help tremendously in our situation (unless things were just improving drastically for other reasons) was mega-doses of DHA (500mg).<br/>

            My 5dd seems to have food sensitivities. Sugar makes her mean and I<br/>
<br/>
think she reacts to dairy(allergies) . Does anyone have experience with<br/>
<br/>
the elimination diet? I&#39;ve heard of it but don&#39;t know much about it.<br/>
<br/>
And the biggest question, how would I implement that wrt her choice of<br/>
<br/>
food. She is a very picky eater, different textures annoy her and no<br/>
<br/>
foods mixed, unless it&#39;s chocolate ice cream with chocolate chunks :)<br/>

I&#39;m really searching for anything that can help her.  She does not<br/>

does feel.<br/>
<br/>
RU is very new for me and I still feel like a fish out of water but I<br/>
know in my heart it is the best for us. Before starting to deschool I<br/>
regulated what was in the house to a certain extent because of how<br/>
Sophia reacted and just limited those options for her. Of course I<br/>
still sneaked what I wanted to eat-I have a weight and eating<br/>
issues-how awful is that? Hmmmmm, do you think there is more to this<br/>
issue(read very sarcastically)? I almost freeze up, actually i do<br/>
freeze up when it comes to choosing what food our home will have in<br/>
it, then I freeze up again when it comes to making a meal for fear<br/>
that I made the &quot;wrong&quot; choices according to one expert or another.<br/>
HEEEELP!!<br/>

Sorry that went a bit off topic, I do think I have some thinking to do.<br/>

One kind of Omega-3.  It&#39;s what formula manufacturers added in a few years ago so that, in the words of one (need I say, mistaken) grandmother I heard of recently, &quot;It&#39;s just as good as breastmilk now.&quot;   Sorry:-)<br/>

Hmmm... makes me realize that if DHA indeed helps my 7yo, it fits my theory that somehow weaning was related to my son&#39;s increased aggression.  The aggression toward his younger brother started (or at least increased substantially and turned to biting instead of hitting) shortly after my middle son weaned.  Of course, my youngest being 2.5 and also biting at the time was undoubtedly also a factor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968414480">Our daughter reacts QUITE strongly to corn syrup, fortunately for us our friend and <br/>
therapist noticed before we did, we could not quite make the connections.<br/>
<br/>
We started paying very close attention to labels, and just spend one day in the store <br/>
finding all the snack foods and basics that were free of corn (She reacts to all corn, BTW) <br/>
Corn syrup is insidious, for example, nearly all storebought breads have corn syrup in <br/>
them, nearly all cereals have corn of some type. Condiments, ice cream, chips and <br/>
crackers, we had to do our research and find alternatives. We feel so fortunate lately to <br/>
find that Newman&#39;s Own oreos are corn free! Woohoo. <br/>
<br/>
So find the snacks that are corn free, and start buying those. Offer them alongside of fresh <br/>
fruit and veggies, cheez-its, goldfish, homemade fries and chips, sugar free popsicles and <br/>
ice cream, etc. One you start bringing in acceptable replacements, it&#39;ll be alot easier to <br/>
point out that oreo&#39;s make us feel bad, but newman o&#39;s are really good and don&#39;t. Does <br/>
that make sense? We even made our own marshmallows last week, which was (messy) fun. <br/>

I think I first knew of someone on another list who thought her son might be bipolar and had read that it was good for that.  But what really led to my trying it was a book called The LCP Solution intended for ADHD.  I just saw an article about it online a few days ago too; not sure how I came across that but I could look -- I&#39;m assuming it was not on this list.   I don&#39;t remember if the book addressed aggression or if it was putting two and two together -- aggression can be characteristic of ADHD, DHA helps ADHD, so maybe it will help with the aggression too.  I do think my son&#39;s frustrations (which sometimes end in aggression) are often triggered by distractibility and difficulty focusing.  Both of my older boys also have very dry skin around their hands and ankles which is also an indication that they may benefit from the fish oil.<br/>

Nothing is as good as breast-milk. I feel a little silly not knowing<br/>
<br/>
about DHA but Sophia never had any formula and was an on demand very<br/>
<br/>
extended nurser. How did you know about it possibly helping with the<br/>
<br/>
aggression?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-297615411"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;snip&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rachel asked:<br/>
What is DHA??<br/>
<br/>
Katherine replied:<br/>
One kind of Omega-3. It&#39;s what formula manufacturers added in a few years<br/>
ago so that, in the words of one (need I say, mistaken) grandmother I heard<br/>
of recently, &quot;It&#39;s just as good as breastmilk now.&quot; Sorry:-)<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm... makes me realize that if DHA indeed helps my 7yo, it fits my theory<br/>
that somehow weaning was related to my son&#39;s increased aggression. The<br/>
aggression toward his younger brother started (or at least increased<br/>
substantially and turned to biting instead of hitting) shortly after my<br/>
middle son weaned. Of course, my youngest being 2.5 and also biting at the<br/>
time was undoubtedly also a factor.<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

The problem for figuring it all out though, is that when you add DHA (or<br/>
other omega 3&#39;s like in fish or linseed) you are also adding extra protein<br/>
usually and always more fat (a good kind) and so it would be worth the<br/>
trouble to notice if he improves generally after adding protein (or fat) to<br/>
the diet.  Also, there is the issue of placebo because you are trying<br/>
something new and standing back and watching carefully to see if it had an<br/>
effect.  You may also be speaking more calmly b/c you are engaged in<br/>
attending to the result of your experiment. KWIM?  Does speaking more calmly<br/>
help? That would be good to know.<br/>
 <br/>
I think Meredith&#39;s comment was good about looking at lots of things &lt;&lt;&lt;don&#39;t<br/>
just notice foods, but other factors, sleep, people, your own <br/>
mood. Talk with her about all of this - does she *feel* a difference? Keep<br/>
track of good, mellow, happy times, too and see if there&#39;s a pattern there -<br/>
maybe she needs *more* of something.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
And also someone said to bring in more food choices before you start<br/>
eliminating anything.  That is helpful.  You may be able to stave off the<br/>
feeling of deprivation if there are new and different choices around instead<br/>
of fewer.<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

Me:  I doubt I&#39;m adding any significant amount of protein since I&#39;m giving him the gel tabs not the fish itself; protein info is not listed on the bottle.  Certainly this is anecdotal and not a double-blind study and a placebo effect is possible.  (Although frankly I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s &quot;real&quot; or placebo if it results in a more peaceful life!)  However, I&#39;ve tried other things in the past and not seen the kind of improvement I saw after we started the fish oil.  Plus, I actually wasn&#39;t watching for improvement then.  On the contrary, I suddenly thought one day, &quot;Wow!  He&#39;s been doing really, really well for the past couple weeks.  I wonder why?&quot;  And then, trying to figure out if anything was different, I remembered the fish oil.  I hadn&#39;t expected any improvement due to it that quickly, although I had read that some people see a difference in a week or so while others need several months.<br/>
<br/>
All of that said, however, this past week has not been so great.  Hard to say if this is a case of two steps forward, one step back.  Or if the good weeks were just a fluke (I hope not!). <br/>
