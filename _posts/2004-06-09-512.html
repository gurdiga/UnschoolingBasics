<br/>
I think you&#39;re on the right track, I think the difficult thing is to <br/>
see where a <br/>
limit is truly potentially harmful and when it&#39;s just a kneejerk <br/>
reaction <br/>
because &quot;we have to&quot;. (NOT)<br/>
Usually, there is a way to redirect truly destructive behavior by <br/>
understanding <br/>
their motivation. If your child wants to paint themselvs green and <br/>
streak naked, <br/>
maybe the yard would be an ok place, rather than the street.:)<br/>
And if you are really bothered by children writing all over the <br/>
walls, you could <br/>
designate certain walls for just that purpose, or their rooms. There <br/>
is this <br/>
great stuff at paint and hardware stores now, it&#39;s paint-on <br/>
chalkboard and dry <br/>
erase board, so you can turn any wall in your house into instant <br/>
art! Very cool. <br/>
We&#39;ve also purchased window markers and let them go to town on every <br/>
window in <br/>
the house..my was THAT colorful.<br/>
I think the key is taking their interest seriously, even if it seems <br/>
strange or <br/>
destructive, it&#39;s a NEED at that moment in their lives, we need to <br/>
find a safe <br/>
way to help them do it. And the more they know we are their <br/>
advocates and we are <br/>
here to help them get where they need to go, the more they trust and <br/>
really <br/>
listen to us.<br/>
I have yet to see sugar be truly harmful unless a person has a true <br/>
health <br/>
issue. The problem with children and sugar, is not the sugar, it&#39;s <br/>
the lack of <br/>
protein sometimes. Protein helps keep your blood sugar balanced when <br/>
you ingest <br/>
sugar...so helping them be aware of when they might need some <br/>
protein is much <br/>
more desireable than limiting sugar in my opinion.<br/>
My three year old wanted ice cream first thing in the morning <br/>
yesterday. I still <br/>
have these programmed responses (that fortunately stay in my head <br/>
and don&#39;t get <br/>
to my mouth most of the time) that I have to be aware of, so I&#39;m <br/>
chanting in my <br/>
mind &quot;it has the same ingredients now as it does at 3pm&quot; over and <br/>
over <br/>
as I scoop it up for him. He ate it all, then opened the freezer, <br/>
pulled out a <br/>
piece of chicken breast and said &quot;cook it chicken Mom&quot;.<br/>
He knows what he needs already.<br/>
Sierra will turn down candy for brocolli.<br/>
Trevor will refuse most chocolate, unless it comes on a Twix bar.:)<br/>
Jared will ask me to cool a &quot;real&quot; meal after they&#39;ve had a binge of <br/>
sugar.<br/>
They also choose to eat things that make my health-freak self <br/>
cringe, but I <br/>
trust that they will find their own balance. And if these foods are <br/>
just choices <br/>
among many, it will not seem more desirable.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping a child from running on a busy street is doing for them what <br/>
they would <br/>
WANT us to do if they understood the danger. They don&#39;t understand <br/>
and we ARE <br/>
here to keep them safe. I have to ask myself &quot;why not&quot; when my kids <br/>
come up with some bizarre idea, and usually find a way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the issue of boundaries. I hugely believe in respecting <br/>
people&#39;s <br/>
boundaries and helping my children understand that issue. Another <br/>
person&#39;s <br/>
property is not something up for grabs, we need to have their ok <br/>
before doing <br/>
anything to it.<br/>
Picking flowers from a neighbors garden is not ok without their <br/>
permission, but <br/>
a young child can&#39;t possibly understand the issue of personal <br/>
boundaries....SO,<br/>
I&#39;d go buy them some flowers of their own, or ask the neighbor if we <br/>
can pick a <br/>
few, or go on a walk to pick wildflowers, or help them grow a little <br/>
flower <br/>
garden or something to fulfill the need.<br/>
Once we get past all the rules and &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; stuck in our heads, <br/>
we <br/>
can begin to think more creatively and honor everyone&#39;s needs and <br/>
interests.<br/>
Sure, there are real life limits. I&#39;m here to help my child <br/>
creatively navigate <br/>
those and to not add more limits that aren&#39;t necessary.<br/>
Some are.<br/>
We have to be especially mindful and comfortable with our children <br/>
being who <br/>
they are in order to figure out the times that a limit exists for <br/>
real reasons, <br/>
and when it&#39;s just arbitrary or because society frowns upon <br/>
individuality.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447422509">Thanks for your input.  It&#39;s funny...it&#39;s good to be reminded that <br/>
the ice cream has the same ingredients at 8am as they do at <br/>
3pm....and yes, naked backyard play (with a variety of coverings from <br/>
green paint to shaving cream to mud) is a common everyday occurence <br/>
in our house.  Good thing we live in Southern California.<br/>

<br/>
Does any one know where to order this online?  All the stores around here<br/>
only sell chalkboard paint in a spray can which believe me doesn&#39;t work so<br/>
well.  I have been wanting to do this in my house for so long.  People(read<br/>
parents) think I&#39;m crazy. I don&#39;t really like the way scribbles look on the<br/>
walls, and I have many, but I don&#39;t want to stop them from expressing<br/>
themselves.  I love their art more than I love my walls.  Yeah for<br/>
chalkboard paint if I can find it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215342877">So this is small potatoes compared to a lot of the situations I&#39;ve read<br/>
about on this list in terms of folks letting go of limits, but I wanted to<br/>
relate something that happened yesterday which has proved to me that being<br/>
on this list and reading all of these amazing posts is helping me to<br/>
identify and let go of some of my thinking and reactions that have no real<br/>
anything behind them other than being a left over remnant of the way I was<br/>
brought up which I haven&#39;t examined.<br/>
<br/>
The other evening I came home to my son (3.4) who announced that his M&M guy<br/>
that he painted at Plaster Fun Time had broken.  He didn&#39;t seem inordinately<br/>
upset about it.  Later that day, I heard a loud &quot;bang&quot; on the kitchen floor.<br/>
I came in to ask him if something broke again.  As I walked in he picked up<br/>
his plaster piece and gleefully smashed it onto the hardwood floor.  My<br/>
immediate internal reaction was to scream &quot;Stop!&quot; at the top of my lungs.<br/>
Somehow, possibly thanks to you all, what came out of my mouth was a very<br/>
calm sounding &quot;Nick, looks like you want it to break.  I just want to be<br/>
sure you&#39;re okay if we can&#39;t get it back together again.&quot;  &quot;That&#39;s okay,<br/>
Mama&quot; he shouted gleefully and proceeded to really get into smashing it all<br/>
over the kitchen floor.  Actually my daughter (who is a sensitive soul) was<br/>
more upset than me, but calmed down after we clarified that yes, she<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to do that to her things, but it was really okay with Nicky<br/>
and it was Nicky&#39;s thing.  So we went off and did something else while he<br/>
smashed.  At one point he said, not upset but just in an observatory kind of<br/>
way, &quot;Mama, this big piece, doesn&#39;t smash apart!&quot;  So we talked about why<br/>
that piece might be harder to break.  It turned into one big experiement ...<br/>
it was cool and very liberating for all of us.<br/>

Wow. Cool story Joan!! And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a small victory at all...I think it&#39;s HUGE.:) I can&#39;t always stop my kneejerk reactions towards destruction sometimes, and I end up kicking myself later. <br/>
I loved your story.<br/>
<br/>
After my Mom died a couple years ago, I ended up with some of her figurines. One of them is this Precious Moments boy, with a sad look on his face, a big tear coursing down his cheek, holding up a paper that says &quot;report card&quot;...YUCK! I hated that thing.<br/>
It had been cracked and glued once before, so I decided it would be cathartic to smash the hell out of it. I gave it to Sierra, wrapped in a ziploc bag and she had a ball turning it into dust.<br/>
<br/>
Your story reminded me of one I&#39;ve read about Einstein, when he was a small boy (don&#39;t know if it&#39;s factual or not). He spilled some milk, and rather than berate him, or even clean it up, his mother sat down and pointed to the lovely reflections on it and swirled their fingers in it a bit. She taught him the important lesson that day...that spilled milk was a chance to observe and experiment, how awesome is that?<br/>
<br/>
You can save his smashed up plaster and use it for a mosaic, or some other artsy project. From destruction comes creation! I&#39;d save a piece for my journal at least.<br/>

&gt; know people like you when my first two where growning up,,,the poor guys were <br/>
&gt; my guniea pigs on what works and what doesnt.it took having a few more to <br/>
&gt; relax the couldve&#39;s,,,shouldve&#39;s,,ought to do&#39;s...alot of stuff our moms felt was <br/>
&gt; sooo important,like keeping a kid clean,and EVERYTHING put away,,99% of the <br/>
&gt; time,,,drove me nutz,,,dirt washes,and they DO out grow most of the <br/>
&gt; toys,,,eventually,,and too much clean makes a kid neorotic....lol...my opinion,,,for <br/>

Thanks so much for sharing this.  I have promoted mistakes as an opportunity<br/>
to learn, but your post helped me reflect that my idea of &quot;learning&quot; would<br/>
be &quot;we just learned to carry the milk more carefully&quot; LOL.  So this morning<br/>
my daughter dropped an egg and said &quot;whoops&quot;.  I went over and said &quot;Hey,<br/>
look at the way some of these pieces of eggshell flew out of the point where<br/>
the egg smashed!&quot; and we really found some super flyer eggshell pieces and<br/>
talked about why some of them might have flown farther than others and why<br/>
that yolk didn&#39;t fly anywhere and what it was doing.<br/>
<br/>
It was SO awesome.<br/>
