 </span></blockquote>You know.....a cookie cutter life is this life you&#39;re all describing, the one where we try to <br/>
meet everyone&#39;s needs all the time, where everyone is treated as equals, where we are <br/>
patient and responsive just about all the time, where we don&#39;t restrict our kids from <br/>
things, blah, blah, blah, the one about which books are written.  If there&#39;s no such thing as <br/>
a cookie cutter unschooling life, then why does this list exist?  Why are there books <br/>
written?  If there&#39;s not one way of doing it, what are you all always talking about?  Isn&#39;t this <br/>
list to help people learn a certain way of living with their children?  I don&#39;t think I am so off <br/>
to use the term &quot;cookie cutter life.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Come on.  Why do you assume I am ignorant? I am a life long homeschooler, mostly an <br/>
unschoooler.  I have been immersed in the un/homeschooling world since before my kids <br/>
were even school age.  I *know* that every family is different.  I know every family is going <br/>
to *look* different based on very many variables.  Give me a break!  That&#39;s not what I was <br/>
talking about, and why didn&#39;t *you* know that?  Why did you assume otherwise?<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So was that just some rote way of saying that you aren&#39;t willing to step out<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Excuse me?  I post on this list, I think, just this one day, and you think you know me well <br/>
enough to make this comment?  P-lease.  Just what box do you think I put my family in?  <br/>
You don&#39;t know us.  What are you assuming?  Seriously, that I want to know.  That&#39;s a <br/>
ridiculous statement.  Did I ever say I was unwilling to step out of a box?  How did I imply <br/>
this?  Why would I be here asking questions?!  I, in fact, specifically said I wanted to <br/>
understand.  Did you assume that I was only here to argue?  You are wrong, and that&#39;s a <br/>
big mistake.  <br/>
<br/>
... and instead throwing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; out that lame comment<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nice.  Way to be helpful.  (And yes, that was sarcasm.)  Because *you* misunderstood my <br/>
meaning you call my words lame.  Is this, calling people&#39;s words lame, that respect thing <br/>
we model for our kids?  We are to treat our kids with respect (of course) and model respect <br/>
for them....why do you think it&#39;s OK to treat me, a stranger, practically a guest in this <br/>
forum, someone coming here for help, with such disrespect ?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;like we would all fall for it?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fall for it?  Seriously, where are you coming from?   Fall for it?  Fall for what?  I totally don&#39;t <br/>
get you, and I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; You&#39;re lucky that<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, yes, if she&#39;s anything like you, then, yes, I will consider myself lucky.  I can&#39;t see how <br/>
it would be helpful to have any of my comments &quot;rip(ped)....up one side and down the <br/>
other.&quot;  In fact, if I got more replies like yours, or any like you suspect hers might have <br/>
been, I surely would not be here, able to dialogue with the people who were so generous <br/>
to take the time to kindly reply to me.<br/>
 <br/>
Why are you here, Lesa?  Are you here to learn the basics of homeschooling, or are you <br/>
here to help others learn what you already know?  If you want to be here to help people, <br/>
why would you come off like gangbusters thinking someone posting is a troll, just looking <br/>
for trouble?  Why would you assume the worst?  If you can&#39;t be kind and respectful and <br/>
offer help, then I think you should keep your comments to yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Not that you&#39;d care, but because of your comment, I was sooooooooo close to just <br/>
unsubbing and finding help for my journey elsewhere.  How can I expect to get help from <br/>
someone so unkind?  I would not want to learn from or model my life after someone who <br/>
behaved the way you did.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, people of the list, is this typical, that someone would post in this brash way, <br/>
and no one comments?  Don&#39;t ya&#39;all call each other out?  Or maybe you do so off-list.  Or <br/>
am I alone in thinking Lesa&#39;s post rude?  Some people will be disuaded from posting here, <br/>
unable to benefit from you all&#39;s help if they get replies like this.  If you all want to be <br/>
helpful, wouldn&#39;t you want to rein in people who post with insufficient sensitivity?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-323983057">What we&#39;re doing here, Maura, is not looking for &quot;right&quot; answers but<br/>
bouncing back to each other ideas of &quot;this is my situation and I&#39;m<br/>
trying to get from A to C but I&#39;m stuck on B - got any ideas for getting<br/>
unstuck?&quot; We&#39;re here for folks who come around saying &quot;school was<br/>
killing my child, so I took him/her out and we homeschooled but that was<br/>
a battle and it was getting us nowhere. I was browsing through Yahoo<br/>
groups and saw this one. What&#39;s unschooling? I&#39;ve read a bit and it<br/>
seems like it would be really good for our family. Can you help me<br/>
understand how to navigate the laws of my state and unschool at the same<br/>
time?&quot; It&#39;s also for &quot;We just pulled the kids out last fall and love our<br/>
newly free lives BUT the ILs are giving us a lot of grief over our<br/>
decision. How have y&#39;all handled that?&quot; And sometimes it&#39;s &quot;Hey folks -<br/>
I&#39;m just so tired of people questioning why I&#39;m &quot;still&quot; nursing my 3 yr<br/>
old. Can I vent a bit?&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Yes, the *principles* look a lot alike but how it looks in practice is<br/>
different from family to family, person to person. It&#39;s about seeing<br/>
everyone, whether 2 or 92 as equally valid PEOPLE with equally valid<br/>
wants, needs, viewpoints. One phrase that gets used often is &quot;would you<br/>
do/say/react the same way to this event if it was your<br/>
spouse/partner/neighbor? how would you react if your<br/>
spouse/partner/neighbor acted this way toward you?&quot;, perhaps reframing<br/>
things to jog out of that pre-set mindset. For instance, I just<br/>
mentioned to DH the other day that we (generic society we) work hard to<br/>
impart &quot;do to others as you would have them do to you&quot; so if our kid<br/>
hits another, we turn around and give him/her a smack on the butt or<br/>
send him/her into &quot;solitary&quot; aka time out. Bit of a mixed message<br/>
involved. So, part of what this board talks about is how to move away<br/>
from that societally conditioned reward/punishment paradigm in child<br/>
rearing to a paradigm that seeks to address the root cause of the<br/>
behavior rather than address the symptom (which also ties in with<br/>
parallel threads often seen of folks looking for alternatives to<br/>
mainstream westernized medical practices which tend to medicate the<br/>
symptoms away without necessarily looking at what is causing the<br/>
symptoms). Then, when we have at least an idea of the roots of the<br/>
situation, we can work *as a team* with the child and other members of<br/>
the family to find ways to address needs - sometimes it means that we<br/>
have to be pretty creative in finding workable compromises.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve got a 9 yr old DS and often get &quot;gee wish I had some of his energy!<br/>
does he ever slow down?&quot; type comments. Finding ways to meet his need to<br/>
be active while also dealing with things such as DH&#39;s permanent hip<br/>
damage (sometimes even sitting is painful) and my work schedule and<br/>
health situations as well (type 2 diabetes plus hypothyroid often leave<br/>
me really tired in the evenings) requires lots of flexibility (mentally<br/>
if not physically) and lots of *discussion* - not talking &quot;to&quot; DS but<br/>
&quot;with&quot; DS. There have been times when I&#39;ve posted with situations and<br/>
gotten feedback on &quot;have you tried this? is this possible? what<br/>
about...?&quot; and it&#39;s all good - some might not apply or be doable where<br/>
we are but some is and some triggers a whole new line of thinking -<br/>
&quot;gee, that&#39;s not available but we do have this which is similar - we<br/>
could check that out and see if it might be doable&quot; And sometimes I&#39;ve<br/>
not even posted, just read a bit and thought &quot;hey that&#39;s a cool idea! -<br/>
I&#39;ll see if we want to try doing that&quot;. We rarely say &quot;No&quot; flat out -<br/>
more often it&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m really tired right now so I&#39;d rather do something<br/>
besides run around the yard with light sabers. How about we plan for<br/>
that tomorrow after dinner and watch a Star Wars movie right now?&quot;<br/>
Sometimes that&#39;s okay; sometimes it&#39;s not okay - he needs to move when<br/>
he needs to move. So, we might determine that a trip to the playground<br/>
is in order so he can run and I can sit. Or it might be something else.<br/>
There&#39;s no one &quot;if x then y&quot; thing - it&#39;s not rules, it&#39;s principles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-437085101">~~Why are there books written? If there&#39;s not one way of doing it,<br/>
what are you all always talking about? Isn&#39;t this list to help people<br/>
learn a certain way of living with their children?~~<br/>
<br/>
Yes, an idea, a philosophy, a lifestyle...which looks completely<br/>
different from family to family and person to person. So calling it<br/>
&quot;cookie-cutter&quot; is really incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
When you take the idea of being kind for example, that will look<br/>
extremely different in different situations. Sometimes being kind is<br/>
stopping someone from hurting themselves. What is kindness to one<br/>
person, would be rude to another. So keeping the principles of respect<br/>
at the forefront, we respond to each and every situation differently.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that with your son, every suggestion made has brought you<br/>
back to the idea of restricting him. We are trying to say there are<br/>
ways to creatively solve these issues, without stopping the play.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going out on a limb here, but I&#39;m going to make a few guesses. It<br/>
sounds to me like there are too many children over for this kind of<br/>
play at once. It sounds like the other parents are turning their<br/>
children loose and nobody is supervising the gun play. I think that&#39;s<br/>
a bad idea considering all the problems that keep surfacing with<br/>
people getting hurt. For one parent to be responsible for that many<br/>
children is probably stressful. I&#39;m certainly ok with saying &quot;sorry,<br/>
we already have company today&quot; if too many kids come over.<br/>
<br/>
Are they wearing safety goggles? Is there ANY kind of &quot;code of<br/>
conduct&quot; agreed upon by the children and adults involved to keep<br/>
everyone safe? If somebody was trying to harm any child near me and<br/>
ignored the obvious &quot;stop now&quot;, then all game play ends right there<br/>
until we can come to an agreement that works for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Hurting people repeatedly when they are saying &quot;no thanks&quot; is not ok.<br/>
What are you doing to keep your younger child safe? He shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
to feel threatened in his own home. ARe you present during their play<br/>
so you can head things off at the pass so to speak? <br/>
<br/>
I know that some children are especially challenging. I have a child<br/>
that is 6y.o. that challenges me to be a better person every day. I<br/>
also know that if that intense child doesn&#39;t feel they shine in your<br/>
eyes, it amps up the behavior and insecurity. They already feel<br/>
&quot;different&quot; than other people. They need to know they are celebrated<br/>
and adored for exactly who they are.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of focusing on changing his behavior, think about ways to meet<br/>
him where he IS. He lacks certain tools. Rather than restricting him,<br/>
think about ways to help him get what he needs. I would have NO<br/>
hesitation approaching the other kids and asking them to come up with<br/>
a code of conduct with me, for play time. If they can&#39;t respect the<br/>
codes they help create, for safety, then they aren&#39;t welcome to play<br/>
at this moment in time. Giving everyone a safe space to play is important.<br/>
<br/>
Create big, fun game days in your yard. Talk about the safety issues<br/>
ahead of time. We would point out the people NOT involved in a game<br/>
and say &quot;please remember that Ciara and Jared have NOT agreed to be a<br/>
part of this game, it is not ok to shoot at them&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t have problems with kids ignoring that. If I see a<br/>
potential problem arising, I can remind the child that doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
be shot, they may want to go inside. Or I might remind the shooters<br/>
that &quot;so-and-so does NOT want to be shot..no thank you&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty blunt with neighbor kids. They aren&#39;t being raised like my<br/>
children and I can&#39;t treat them the same way at times. We had two<br/>
neighbor kids at our house ALL the time in Pensacola. I would hide<br/>
certain foods when they came over because food was limited and<br/>
controlled at their house so it would disappear and my kids would be<br/>
upset. It wasn&#39;t in the budget to feed unlimited amounts to neighbor kids.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty clear about boundaries when neighbor kids come over. I<br/>
might say &quot;I really don&#39;t like ____________, we don&#39;t do that in our<br/>
house&quot; and then give them an option that might work better. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty hard to have the same principles in effect at all times,<br/>
when those other children aren&#39;t used to operating that way. What<br/>
we&#39;ve found, is that over time they figure out how we do things and<br/>
adapt quite well.<br/>
<br/>
With safety issues, is it really that hard to help the kids come up<br/>
with some boundaries for everyone&#39;s benefit?  Try to help them all get<br/>
what they need....nobody WANTS to get hurt.<br/>

I have experience to draw on, I can talk about what is good about  <br/>
porn and what is not-so-good, both about how it&#39;s produced and how  <br/>
it&#39;s consumed. My own curiosity has led me in that direction in the  <br/>
past, so I can affirm that the curiosity itself is not a bad thing. I  <br/>
hope they would accept my guidance. I am working on my relationships  <br/>
with my kids right now (they&#39;re only 6 and 3) in the hope that I can  <br/>
remain someone they will trust, both to be in conversation with, and  <br/>
maybe to believe me if I say (as I do sometimes now about certain  <br/>
movies, for instance), &quot;I&#39;m not sure you&#39;d be comfortable watching  <br/>
that.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091545585">***Come on. Why do you assume I am ignorant? I am a life long <br/>

<br/>
Cookie cutter doesn&#39;t mean what you&#39;re insisting in means.  It&#39;s <br/>
been used on unschooling lists for years to refer to the kind of <br/>
education public schooled kids get, the kind of treatment kids <br/>
receive in school where the individual needs of children are <br/>
ignored.   <br/>
<br/>
Cookie cutter means the same process over and over again with no <br/>
variance and no thought to the individual with the hope of achieving <br/>
the same result, a cookie cutter copy, every time. <br/>
<br/>
You misused the word.   No one assumed you were ignorant, we read <br/>
what you wrote. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a philosophy of treating children respectfully.  <br/>
Personalities will be different in every home, resources will be <br/>
different, but the belief that children are born fully equipped to <br/>
live in the human world is the same.  How individual home lives look <br/>
will vary.  That&#39;s not &quot;cookie cutter.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Cookie cutter&quot; was a pretty insulting thing to sling out there, <br/>
though you probably didn&#39;t know it was offensive.  This list is <br/>
eyeball deep in folks who&#39;ve thought about and rejected the cookie <br/>
cutter education and life for their children - really thoughtful, <br/>
mindful people who&#39;ll be happy to move on now and answer your <br/>
unschooling questions. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you meant an ideal unschooling life.  That&#39;s within the reach <br/>
on anyone seeking it, and shouldn&#39;t be scoffed at.  There are many <br/>
people living that ideal life, or near ideal, and many striving for <br/>
it, who know the benefits to kids of a thoughtful life. <br/>
