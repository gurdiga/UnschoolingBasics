<div id="ygrps-yiv-92351454">&quot;I did raise my voice at her and probably pushed it a bit too far, <br/>
but do you have any other suggestions on how to handle a situation <br/>
like this if it ever comes up again?  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the demand came along, I would have walked over and helped<br/>
her with the chair (or whatever she needed help with) and said &quot;she&#39;s<br/>
busy playing right now, let&#39;s let her be&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If it still continues to escalate and my child was threatened<br/>
physically, I would pick up my child and leave immediately. I would<br/>
have said something along the lines of &quot;we believe hitting people that<br/>
are vulnerable and defenseless is abusive and I won&#39;t let my children<br/>
be subjected to your abuse&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would make my boundaries very clear and if they can&#39;t respect that,<br/>
then those people would not be part of my life. I choose to surround<br/>
myself with positive, uplifting and interesting people. The contact I<br/>
would have with anyone toxic would be minimal. It&#39;s hard enough for me<br/>
to be around parents that aren&#39;t super nice to their kids, I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine being around someone that was mean to my kids. ugh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479153903">&quot;We have a &quot;created family&quot; which we built from friends who respect us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think when a person is ready to limit the toxic people in their<br/>
lives and search out positive individuals, they will find the right<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had a luxurious social network in the past, including single<br/>
friends that were extremely gentle/respectful to all children. My<br/>
friend Bonnie used to regularly invite Sierra over to visit and attend<br/>
plays or other functions. Sierra wasn&#39;t quite ready to do those things<br/>
without me at that time, so I tagged along. But she had this wonderful<br/>
relationship with an adult that was &quot;created family&quot;. We&#39;ve got a<br/>
friend that moved up here from P&#39;cola with us, that is part of our<br/>
&quot;created family&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We do have a very positive family on both sides fortunately, but they<br/>
all live so far away we still feel a need to develop close, personal<br/>
relationships with people that act as &quot;aunties&quot; and &quot;uncles&quot; to our<br/>
children.<br/>

This sounds so wonderful!  I&#39;d love to know if there are other <br/>
organizations that respect children so we can create our own family. <br/>

We live in an area in the South where children are expected to obey <br/>
and not mouth off.  Even the liberal churches we have visited condone <br/>
spanking, etc.  <br/>

We have had a very hard time even in the homeschool community - many <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.uua.org">http://www.uua.org</a>  I also believe that the United Church of Christ is<br/>
very supportive of gentle parenting (I have a few friends who attend<br/>
UCC churches and they would never think of spanking their children).<br/>
I believe the url is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ucc.org">http://www.ucc.org</a>  While I have run into<br/>
individuals within the UU church who spanked their children, most UU&#39;s<br/>
that I know consider it the same as partner abuse and would never even<br/>
consider spanking as an option in parenting!  Many of our &quot;created<br/>
family&quot; are made up of people we have met through the UU church.<br/>

I think leaving would&#39;ve been a good idea, but as a mom, your first <br/>
instinct is to protect your child/children.  In this case, I <br/>
probably would&#39;ve done the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Although this is a tough situation, (I really don&#39;t get along with <br/>
my in-laws, for many reasons) I agree with what a lot of people are <br/>
suggesting.  Maybe an email would help, but then staying away and <br/>
letting the situation die down a little wouldn&#39;t hurt.<br/>
<br/>
I think things could&#39;ve turned out different, if you MIL would&#39;ve <br/>
asked for help, instead of demanding it, and the part about hitting <br/>
your child is just really uncalled for.  My husband and I really <br/>
don&#39;t agree with spanking children.  Our philosophy is that if we <br/>
are teaching our children not to hit, if we spank them, then we are <br/>
going against everything we are trying to teach.  (I hope that makes <br/>
sense).<br/>
<br/>
I our case my MIL said she was glad that we decided to homeschool <br/>
our children, but it was my mom that had a tough time.  She is <br/>
finally starting to come around, but I think she is more old-<br/>
school.  She worked in the school system for 29 years, and I think <br/>
has been through it/ seen it all.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are still deschooling, and are doing so much more better, <br/>
than they would&#39;ve been doing in school.  They love homeschooling, <br/>
and are really enjoying it.  <br/>
<br/>
I really hope this situation gets resolved, whether it be from just <br/>
staying away, or talking to them, or emailing them.  I don&#39;t have <br/>
the answer, but if you search your heart, you will know what to do.  <br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947444255"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Oh, and I wanted to ask the original poster... where was your DH <br/>
 </span></blockquote>when this all was going on?  <br/>
<br/>
Sitting right next to me.  He seems ok with the unschooling <br/>
philosophy when it comes to &quot;school&quot; but giving choices to our <br/>
children is another thing.  I don&#39;t think he quite &quot;gets it&quot; <br/>
either.  He thought my FIL was right for refusing to let them have a <br/>
ride since my daughter told his mom &quot;no&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s having a hard time coming to grips with a no rewards-punishment <br/>
type parenting.  He truly believes they will turn into deviants if <br/>
they don&#39;t have consequences (i.e. not riding the 4 wheeler because <br/>
she didn&#39;t want to help get a chair for her grandmother).  He <br/>
believes because she said no, that his dad had a right to say no to <br/>
her.  <br/>
<br/>
He thinks I&#39;m being &quot;too permissive&quot; with them.  My oldest is very <br/>
keen on the differences and of course prefers to ask me things, over <br/>
him, because as she say &quot;he doesn&#39;t listen to me&quot;.  I have requested <br/>
that he read things or listen to a broadcast I downloaded (one with <br/>
Alfie Kohn) - he doesn&#39;t want to.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m explaining the <br/>
concept well enough, or he just doesn&#39;t want to get it.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know if he is capable of trusting them.<br/>
<br/>
As far as passing along reading material or email to my in-laws - <br/>
they don&#39;t have email and rarely ever read a book.  They believe I&#39;m <br/>
an evil &quot;Yankee&quot; (yes said to my face) that has brainwashed their <br/>
son and am poisoning their grandchildren by allowing them to think <br/>
for themselves.  It&#39;s just a very toxic situation that I have been <br/>
dealing with for 11 years.  They haven&#39;t changed at all in that time.<br/>
<br/>

While I don&#39;t use punishments.  I will say that if it was the FIL&#39;s  toy (was <br/>
it a 4 wheeler...I can&#39;t remember), I believe he does have a right to  not <br/>
let anyone use it, or to let just certain people use it.<br/>
 <br/>
Certainly that was a mean thing to do, and he was using  his toy to punish <br/>
your daughter, which I would not do.  But it was his  toy.<br/>
 <br/>
Did you talk with your daughter afterward about the  events of the day?  What <br/>
were her thoughts and  feelings?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps you could explain to him that it&#39;s his *responsibility* to <br/>
either read/digest the material you&#39;ve been providing to him or back <br/>
off and let you and your kids be!!  You could perhaps explain to him <br/>
that his clinging to ignorance (by refusing to read the material) <br/>
should not interfere with your kids becoming all they can be!  He&#39;s <br/>
stuck and unwilling to move forward.  That should not be your kids&#39; <br/>
problem!  Perhaps you could tell him you&#39;d be happy to hear his <br/>
arguments about your excessive permissiveness *after* he has read <br/>
*all* the material.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;she say &quot;he doesn&#39;t listen to me&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps he needs to understand that at least one of his kids doesn&#39;t <br/>
trust him, and that is a dangerous situation!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;...he just doesn&#39;t want to get it. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;know if he is capable of trusting them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t see why he wouldn&#39;t be &quot;capable&quot; of trusting them.  But, he&#39;s <br/>
got some serious work to do if he wants *them* to trust *him*!  ;-) <br/>
And, it&#39;s *his* work to do.  (The very last thing I would want is a <br/>
kid who didn&#39;t trust me!)  And, since he buys into the concept of <br/>
unschooling, it may be important for him to understand that Trust is <br/>
the fertile soil in which Unschooling flourishes.  Without it, <br/>
unschooling can never take root and withers!  (Can you tell I love to <br/>
garden!?)  ;-)<br/>
<br/>

have you, though!!!  In this case, I think I would limit my kids&#39; <br/>
exposure to this situation and be on my toes the whole time I was <br/>
there.  In the meanwhile, I would probably start seeking out other <br/>
&quot;family,&quot; as another poster so beautifully stated, and create a <br/>
family that&#39;s loving and nurturing and supportive.  Look at it this <br/>
way:  You&#39;re probably not the only person in your geographic area <br/>
with your set of values, and even though *you* may be a rare flower, <br/>
there are probably others out there, too.  Perhaps a UU church would <br/>
be a good place to start, or even a local La Leche League group (even <br/>
if you&#39;re not BFing)!  These two groups could be portals to a <br/>
community where you can feel supported!<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you all the best!!<br/>
