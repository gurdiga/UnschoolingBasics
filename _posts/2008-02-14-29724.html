   <br/>
  Dear Jan and Jason,<br/>
  I got my book yesterday and I had it in my hand all day until I finished!!!!!!!!!<br/>
  I loved it!<br/>
  You know Jan I do not have any doubts about unschooling but if I had any trace  they are totally gone now.<br/>
  It is a perfect book to have in your bedside table when you start doubting yourself. <br/>
  Perfect for new unschoolers and old unschoolers.<br/>
  A gold mine for skeptical dads.<br/>
  Thank you for it,<br/>

  (Still feeling the joy from reading it!)<br/>
