My friend Laura (yes, I live near some really cool peeps) just started<br/>
a new forum for radical unschoolers: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyrun.ning.com/">http://familyrun.ning.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really neat! Kinda like myspace, with ways to connect with<br/>
friends and places for discussions. I might close the new lilaguide<br/>
list and ask everyone to go over there. It&#39;s really cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825803237">Looks cool.  There&#39;s also a new site created by an unschooling dad I<br/>
know and he describes it as <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;a site like Myspace but for unschoolers :-) So instead <br/>
  of being part of Yahoo or Ning, it&#39;s by unschoolers, for<br/>
  unschoolers. Free profiles, blogs, groups, meetups, and <br/>
  calendars for now, and in the future I&#39;m looking to add <br/>
  areas for people to advertise services and stuff. How cool <br/>
  would it be to be able to support other unschoolers? <br/>
