<div id="ygrps-yiv-319447654">My husband and I have finally made up our minds, with our children&#39;s input. We have decided to join the ranks of home schooling families. There are a number of reasons as to why we have decided this finally. We are interested in learning about different styles of home schooling and in positive reinforcement instead of punitive. We have recently relocated from North Carolina to South Carolina and are working parents. We work opposite shifts so one of us will always be home with the children. Their ages are 9 going on 18 and 3 going on 4. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for allowing us to join.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-600600945">What does that mean? I read the first comment and I got befuddled. What does it mean to be 9 going on 18 years or months? How can you be something going on another thing? It seems so anticipatory and not very much about enjoying now with your child.  I know people whose 18 year olds are amazing to be around and 18 months was fantastic, all about exploring and coming back and those first really solid forays into independent moments. It was cuddling and nursing and falling to sleep together and spreading out an old sheet on the floor and getting out glue and glitter and paints and making the most amazing art/mess. <br/>
<br/>
It seems a very derogatory sort of throw off comment. Y&#39;know one of those things that you say because it will illicit a laugh from other people but you don&#39;t really think about how it may bias you against your own child. A young child acting like a teenager or a toddler, not behaving appropriately for their age. But they are appropriate for their age and environment. They just are. I think I may be so far removed from this kind of view that I totally don&#39;t know what would make me think those kinds of things. 18 is the age of majority in the U.S., are they voting? or driving? or what? Is it about saying mean things or dressing too adult? And being a toddler, is that about being emotional about something, needing something, whining about something? I do that at 40 sometimes, and I&#39;m not a toddler. Sometimes I&#39;m just hungry or frustrated or needy. <br/>
<br/>
Language makes a difference. What you say impacts on what you do or think or feel.
