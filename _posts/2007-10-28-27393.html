<div id="ygrps-yiv-482072892">I have two of my children at home with me (my oldest is in high <br/>
school).  My daughter is 10 and my son is 4.  Here is the problem that <br/>
I just can&#39;t figure out how to handle.  DS is very intense and <br/>
extremely strong willed (which I do admire ~ really).  On a daily <br/>
basis, there is meltdown, tantrums and anger, throwing things, etc.   <br/>
Some of the reasons for any of these could be that I can&#39;t make a <br/>
sandwich for him fast enough or get his juice exactly right.  I can <br/>
sense his mood and try to make the situation light-hearted but it often <br/>
just infuriates him.  He has become extremely rude to me.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest situation is when my dd doesn&#39;t want to play with him, <br/>
especially when she has a friend over.  I completely respect that and <br/>
try hard to let them be alone.  This will send ds into a very angry <br/>
tantrum, banging on the door of the room they are trying to play and <br/>
being extremely rude to me, telling me to &quot;leave me alone&quot; or &quot;I said <br/>
stop talking to me&quot;, etc.  He just refuses to take no for an answer.  <br/>
And honestly, I try to say &quot;no&quot; as little as possible, although to him, <br/>
he doesn&#39;t see it that way ~ he only notices the times I do say no.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really at my wits end as it&#39;s really making a rift with my <br/>
daughters.  They just don&#39;t want to be around him and they are sick of <br/>
his almost constant whining, complaining, anger, hitting, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve really, really tried to be understanding and divert his attention <br/>
when things start to escalate and it&#39;ll work for awhile but eventually, <br/>
it ends up back to him crying.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I really hope someone has some advice.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks SO much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-724276447">Julie,<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t really have solutions, but sympathy.  I have a very spirited 4-yr-old<br/>
daughter (dd2).  And it seems to have ratcheted up the last couple of weeks,<br/>
as if it couldn&#39;t get any worse.  There&#39;ve been times when we (both DW and<br/>
I) have parented just abysmally.  So, I&#39;m watching this thread for more<br/>
action.  I guess I need reminding of some things, and hopefully there&#39;s<br/>
something new.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that seems to have made a difference at all, and it doesn&#39;t<br/>
always work, is to try to figure out what the real issue is.  With dd2, it<br/>
appears to be both needing attention, and that she doesn&#39;t like going out<br/>
anywhere (NOTE: we got back from a 10-day road trip a couple weeks ago, had<br/>
a semi-mellow next week, but then went out a lot the next week -- a bit<br/>
soon, I&#39;m guessing).<br/>
<br/>
With dd#2, asking her directly what&#39;s wrong will get you the answer to the<br/>
burr under her saddle about 50% of the time.  If that.  The rest of the time<br/>
it&#39;s watching the environment and the interplay.  She focuses so much on<br/>
what&#39;s in front of her that finding out from her what the real issue is<br/>
(three &quot;events&quot; ago) is not easy.  When we&#39;ve found out the root cause, she<br/>
responds much like, &quot;yeah, that&#39;s it, I forgot&quot;.  And life goes on.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents&#39; worth, and I&#39;m hoping I can pick up a couple of dollars around<br/>
here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566552489">Hi Julie, this is close to my heart as I also have a very strong<br/>
willed 4-year-old DD.  In August she started Head Start (I hadn&#39;t read<br/>
about homeschooling much less unschooling) but before that especially,<br/>
we had a really hard time being together all the time.  She would lay<br/>
in the floor and kick and scream, at the drop of a hat.  My husband<br/>
(her stepdad) gets really angry when she starts screaming, especially<br/>
when our baby boy is sleeping, (and since DH is a night owl he&#39;s<br/>
always trying to sleep through the day) and it&#39;s been really hard to<br/>
find a solution that will help the entire family.  <br/>
<br/>
Lately she has become a little sweetie pie.  She keeps her room picked<br/>
up and even cleans the living room, without being asked.  She&#39;s not<br/>
been needing constant attention and will go in her room and color for<br/>
an hour at a time.  <br/>
<br/>
Part of what has happened is that she&#39;s going to Head Start for 4<br/>
hours a day, so she has somewhere to be every day and is really<br/>
enjoying it.  (I am not saying that you should do the same thing, as a<br/>
matter of fact I have a lot of regrets about sending her there before<br/>
reading up on homeschooling.  This is just a theory on why she&#39;s all<br/>
of a sudden so peaceful.)  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I have started to validate her emotions.  This is when the<br/>
peacefulness really began, almost immediately.  She still has a<br/>
meltdown sometimes, which goes like:<br/>
<br/>
DD:  Mommy, I need you to get me a piece of tape.<br/>
Me:  I&#39;m nursing your brother right now, he&#39;s almost asleep, if you&#39;ll<br/>
give me just a min--<br/>
DD:  *shrieking meltdown before I can get the words out*<br/>
<br/>
Before, I would have gotten out of my chair with the sleepy brother,<br/>
and spanked her, and screamed back.  (I&#39;m not proud of this.  It&#39;s<br/>
very hard to admit.)  I would have been infuriated.  Now, I understand<br/>
why she&#39;s doing this.  It&#39;s because of all the times I said, &quot;In a<br/>
minute,&quot; and didn&#39;t use some follow-through.  Now, I try to get<br/>
through the screams by saying:  &quot;Sweetie, come here.  Okay.  You&#39;re<br/>
angry that I can&#39;t get up right now to go get the tape for you?  And<br/>
you&#39;re afraid that when I say &#39;in a minute&#39; that I don&#39;t mean it?&quot; <br/>
Then I assure her that if she will only wait a minute, we can have<br/>
special one-on-one time, because then her brother will be asleep.  She<br/>
walks away sniffling but consoled.<br/>
<br/>
DD has also been very impatient over getting what she wants to eat or<br/>
drink RIGHT NOW at this second, and I&#39;ve found that if I&#39;m in the<br/>
middle of making it, I&#39;ll say, &quot;I&#39;m making it.&quot;  If after saying that,<br/>
she&#39;s still panicking, I would try one of two things.  1) you can try<br/>
validating his emotions again-- &quot;It&#39;s hard to wait on something to eat<br/>
when you&#39;re hungry and want something in your belly already.&quot;  or 2) <br/>
This is probably my old method, but in this case I think being silent<br/>
 for about 30 seconds while you finish making it would be acceptable.<br/>
  My dd senses my tension and when I try to exasperatedly tell her to<br/>
just be patient, she will start raging.<br/>
<br/>
Also recognize that if he has a lot of pent-up anger, he needs to be<br/>
able to express that.  Maybe you could work with him to find out where<br/>
it&#39;s coming from and healthier ways to express it than beating on his<br/>
sister&#39;s door.  Maybe explain to him that his sister has started to<br/>
not want to play with him at all because of the way he&#39;s been acting,<br/>
and that if he could get out the frustration without actively<br/>
disturbing her that she&#39;d be more likely to WANT to spend time with<br/>
him.  The way to get someone to WANT to be with you is not to scream<br/>
at them and bang on their door.<br/>
<br/>
(Note:  I am new at all this stuff, and part of me is asking myself,<br/>
&quot;Why do you think YOU can give advice?&quot;  But we&#39;ve had a huge<br/>
breakthrough, it&#39;s been mostly due to my change in perspective.  I<br/>
hope this helps even a bit.  I hope it&#39;s not all TOO obvious.)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793536742">My ds2 (10) has always been a very spirited child. He is very tenacious and<br/>
strong willed. I&#39;m sure these traits will serve him well later in life but<br/>
it&#39;s hard being the recipient now, lol. I found The Spirited Child to be<br/>
very beneficial in finding new ways to approach my son and to figure out<br/>
what are the most consistent triggers for his temper. For him, transitions<br/>
were the most difficult--any kind of transition.  Going to bed, leaving the<br/>
house, going on vacation, having people coming to the house--anything.  We<br/>
learned to give him plenty of time to get used to the idea of change and as<br/>
often as we could, let him figure out when he was ready to make the move to<br/>
the new thing.  He was in school up until 1.5 yrs ago and I&#39;m very glad we<br/>
took him out. He has relaxed quite a bit, melt downs are very rare now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021637244">My wonderful middle daughter was like this at 4 years old. Really  <br/>
super super intense, easily angered, very big outbursts over  <br/>
seemingly little things. I worried for years about her ability to  <br/>
cope with the normal difficulties of life. She&#39;s 20 now and she&#39;s  <br/>
fine. Still intense. Still feels things very very strongly. Still  <br/>
super sensitive and easily hurt and that hurt still shows itself as  <br/>
anger (but her anger is no longer in the form of extreme outbursts,  <br/>
she handles herself beautifully, and is able to channel her strong  <br/>
emotions into productive directions).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, accept it that there will be no magic &quot;thing&quot; you can do to  <br/>
change him. The more you accept him as he is, the more you&#39;ll be able  <br/>
to help him. Get really serious about appreciating the way he is --  <br/>
use different vocabulary even in your own head. Don&#39;t think of him as  <br/>
&quot;unreasonable,&quot; for example, or &quot;demanding.&quot; Change those words  <br/>
inside your own head to, &quot;high expectations&quot; and &quot;idealistic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then, focus on supporting him, not on fixing him.<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW this sounds impossible. My intense child has an older and a  <br/>
younger sibling and I really do KNOW what you face in practice.<br/>
<br/>
So - your daughter is in her room with a friend and your son is  <br/>
screaming and banging on the door. In your head, you have a tendency  <br/>
to think, &quot;He is SO rude, so unreasonable, so stubborn,  <br/>
so...whatever.&quot;  Stop yourself and think from his point of view - he  <br/>
is what? He LOVES to be with his sister and her friend so much. He  <br/>
loves to be part of what&#39;s going on. He loves the stimulation of a  <br/>
new and different person in the house. He adores his sister and feels  <br/>
cut off when he has to share her. He feels rejected and put down by  <br/>
not being included. His feelings are hurt AND he doesn&#39;t have  <br/>
perspective and feels like she will ALWAYS be rejecting him from now  <br/>
on and that he&#39;ll always feel this hurt. And, to top it all off, his  <br/>
mother, whom he counts on to fulfill his needs, doesn&#39;t seem to even  <br/>
halfway understand his needs and doesn&#39;t seem to care and is NOT  <br/>
trying to help him, but is judging him as being bad (even if you  <br/>
don&#39;t say it, he knows it). So now add a background sense of shame to  <br/>
the whole scenario, too.<br/>
<br/>
So - now your thinking is realistic. That is a big step. It changes  <br/>
the dynamics. It makes your own behavior result from trying to do  <br/>
what is good for the kids, rather than responding to frustrations and  <br/>
fears that your son&#39;s behavior triggers in you. It&#39;ll help prevent  <br/>
you from aggravating the problem by your own reactions.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe a few very deep slow breaths. Get your thinking back to basic  <br/>
principles. What principles are important here? An important one is  <br/>
that your daughter has a right to safety (from harassment) in her own  <br/>
home. Speak that idea in words your son can understand, but don&#39;t  <br/>
expect him to respond or care. You might speak it a thousand times in  <br/>
the next 10 years or so. It helps to say it out loud so that you are  <br/>
focused on the principle, but it is what you do that really gets the  <br/>
idea across.<br/>
<br/>
Once things have progressed to the point of a hysterical child  <br/>
screaming and banging on the door, out of control, you have to handle  <br/>
it the best you can. It might come down to you carrying a screaming  <br/>
and hitting child away from the door, into another room, and forcibly  <br/>
keeping him in there until he is calm, always using the least  <br/>
possible amount of force. This should have to happen to you more than  <br/>
a time or two, though, before YOU learn to head it off. Again, when  <br/>
these situations arise, we deal with them best we can, trying to keep  <br/>
our thinking clear and stay focused on the basic principles we want  <br/>
to live by. But the most important thing isn&#39;t so much how you deal  <br/>
with that situation, it is that you learn from it so that it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
happen over and over.<br/>
<br/>
There is really NO good outcome once that kind of situation is  <br/>
entrenched. You have to think back to before the situation started  <br/>
and figure out what you could have done to have prevented it. Don&#39;t  <br/>
say that there is no way, don&#39;t say it is unpredictable, don&#39;t say  <br/>
that you did what you could have done. We can give you lots of ideas,  <br/>
but you have to have an attitude of willingness to set things up so  <br/>
they work well for your family, even if other people might think  <br/>
you&#39;re going overboard to accommodate your son&#39;s behavior.<br/>
<br/>
So - you don&#39;t invite a friend over for your daughter again without a  <br/>
prior plan for your son, right? Because you know, for sure, that is  <br/>
not workable. Don&#39;t set up situations that you know are problematic.  <br/>
Make a list of a lot of different options. Son goes to play at a  <br/>
friend&#39;s house, your daughter and her friend play at the park, your  <br/>
daughter goes to friend&#39;s house instead of friend at your house, you  <br/>
have a friend of your son&#39;s over at the same time, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t be forever - he&#39;s four and that is a relatively explosive  <br/>
time of life for most kids, and an extremely intense time of life for  <br/>
those who have that personality. But it is good practice for you -  <br/>
you have to practice thinking ahead and setting up his environment so  <br/>
that he can be successful and happy. That is a way of thinking that  <br/>
will help you as an unschooling parent and in many other ways with  <br/>
other people, too. You&#39;ll thank him later for making it necessary for  <br/>
you to learn so much. Honest.<br/>
<br/>
There is a good book that might give you a lot of ideas along these  <br/>
lines - &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; by Ross Greene.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330867400">**Don&#39;t think of him as &quot;unreasonable,&quot; for example, or &quot;demanding.&quot; Change those words inside your own head to, &quot;high expectations&quot; and &quot;idealistic.&quot;** **In your head, you have a tendency to think, &quot;He is SO rude, so unreasonable, so stubborn, so...whatever.&quot; Stop yourself and think from his point of view - he is what? He LOVES to be with his sister and her friend so much. He loves to be part of what&#39;s going on. He loves the stimulation of a new and different person in the house. He adores his sister and feels cut off when he has to share her.**  I wanted to pull this out, because I just had an &#39;aha!&#39; moment while reading this. I have a pair of intense four-year-olds, and I&#39;ve been at a loss as to what to do when they are in the middle of a tantrum, mostly because I am so stressed out and angry by then that my wonderful, gentle, peaceful parenting principles fly right out the window. DD&#39;s had a friend spend the night last night, and we had a few meltdowns...looking back, thinking about dd&#39;s positively instead of wondering (angrily) why they are behaving this way, has given me a lot of ideas about how *I* could have handled things better, headed some situations off, and supported dd&#39;s, instead of getting exasperated with them.

 </span></blockquote>Hi Julie,<br/>
Your description just hit a chord with me. Especially the things he<br/>
says to you when he&#39;s angry. I have a pretty intense 4.5 yr. old boy<br/>
here. He says those exact words pretty much daily, or at least when<br/>
he&#39;s upset. He has a younger sis (2.5) that he has tolerated for the<br/>
first 2.25 yrs of her life. She recently became the more strong-willed<br/>
of the two (pretty much how he was emotionally at her age) and has<br/>
begun driving him to some pretty strong reactions. It&#39;s not fun. It<br/>
gets me pretty worked up sometimes (unfortunately), and I have begun<br/>
yelling at him to go in his room :(<br/>
It sounds like you are doing a great job already, keeping things<br/>
light-hearted and all. That is the hardest part, our own reactions. <br/>
I have been trying to give DS some one-on-one time doing something he<br/>
loves (art, usually), and it helps. I also try to keep him fed and<br/>
busy. These two things are important around here. My kids are<br/>
free-feeders, but my son seems to forget to eat, or wants me to make<br/>
something when I am in the middle of something else. <br/>
I also try to keep his sis busy. If she is pushing his buttons, I<br/>
divert her attention (hard for me, since I expect her to do this<br/>
herself--I know, I forget she&#39;s 2.5 sometimes!).<br/>
<br/>
I guess the most important thing I can offer is empathy. I absolutely<br/>
feel your frustrations having an intense kiddo myself. This is such a<br/>
tough age. So much is being learned. Independence is really growing in<br/>
so many ways. Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90221625">I appreciate SOOOO much everyone&#39;s input.  And I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m not <br/>
alone.  It makes me feel like I can get through this.  I&#39;ve saved all <br/>
the emails and will, I&#39;m sure, refer to them often, just for moral <br/>
support :O)<br/>
<br/>
I ordered The Explosive Child and Raising your Spirited  Child from the <br/>
library and can&#39;t wait to read them.  Just to understand what he may be <br/>
feeling will help.<br/>
<br/>
I know that he can grow out of this or rather, learn to cope better.  <br/>
He is actually very much like my 16 year old dd but when she was young, <br/>
I know I didn&#39;t handle it well at all.  To this day, she has anger <br/>
issues and very poor coping skills ~ we are working on them but it is a <br/>
slow process.  I don&#39;t want to make the same mistakes w/ my son.<br/>
<br/>
I do try to head off temper tantrums and really try to understand my <br/>
son.  I acknowledge his feelings but it doesn&#39;t always matter ~ he&#39;s <br/>
already on his way to meltdown.  It can be so exhausting always staying <br/>
on my toes ;)<br/>
<br/>
As for the times when dd has a friend over, thank you for the <br/>
suggestions to warn him ahead of time and setting up something special <br/>
to do during that time.  Often, though, friends just stop by and decide <br/>
to stay.  I&#39;m very relaxed that way and love to have kids over.  So, <br/>
maybe keeping special projects at the ready will help.  And they do <br/>
include him for some of the time but at some point, dd really wants to <br/>
be alone with her friend.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wanted to thank everyone who responded. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835994609">Julie and others,<br/>
<br/>
We had a similar issue with our youngest.  We have actually found that her<br/>
triggers are not people, places, or things.  Her triggers are food.<br/>
<br/>
Her biggest/worst trigger EVER is Red dye #40.  This sends her into fits of<br/>
anger.  She hits, kicks, bites, pinches and anything else you can imagine.<br/>
We took her off of Red and Yellow dye back in August.  About a week after we<br/>
took her off it we had a Pirate Treasure party with candy necklaces.  She<br/>
ate the whole thing in a matter of 2 minutes and the rest of the night was<br/>
hard on all of us.  She was filled with extreme anger.<br/>
<br/>
I told my SIL about this incident on a visit a couple days later and they<br/>
noticed a huge difference in DD.  She was able to concentrate on one thing<br/>
for longer than 2 minutes and she didn&#39;t continuously jump from toy to toy<br/>
to toy.  They decided to take my nephew off of red and yellow dye and they<br/>
have also noticed a HUGE difference in him.  Even his teachers have noticed.<br/>
<br/>
The girl that I babysit&#39;s parents have also taken her off the dyes and<br/>
noticed a vast improvement.  So, if I were going to suggest anything, that<br/>
would be the first thing.<br/>
<br/>
We talked to DD too when she was feeling angry about how we thought it was<br/>
because of the dyes.  Now she wants nothing to do with the dyes and if is<br/>
offered something, checks to make sure of the abscence of dyes first.<br/>
<br/>
Even my oldest, who is not sensitive at all will call us on it.  It has made<br/>
a husge difference in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that has had a profound effect on her is High Fructose Corn<br/>
Syrup.  It makes her hyper.<br/>
<br/>
Our occupational therapist told us that in some kids that she has known,<br/>
their triggers have been dairy so it could be a number of things for your<br/>
son.<br/>
<br/>
There is an elimination diet that you could try, but my girls are really<br/>
picky and I knew that wouldn&#39;t go over well so we decided to try things that<br/>
others have told us have triggered their kids.  We also took her to the<br/>
accupunturist who did what I might call the chinese version of an allergy<br/>
test and treated her for a couple of things that she had sensitivites too<br/>
(which not surprisingly included food dyes and sugar as well as trace<br/>
minerals and food sweatners).<br/>

thx<br/>

<br/>
Faith,<br/>
<br/>
Accupuncture and chinese medicine is a bit beyond my comprehension on the<br/>
quantum physics level so I can&#39;t explain WHY the things work, just that in<br/>
our experience, it does.<br/>
<br/>
So, I sat next to Lilly and touched her arm with my hand and he tested HER<br/>
sensitivities THRU me.  When she was sensitive to something he would be able<br/>
to push my arm down and when she wasn&#39;t, my arm stayed strong and<br/>
resistant.  I didn&#39;t believe it until I was actually experiencing it.<br/>
<br/>
For the treatment, he said that kids don&#39;t need needles because their veins<br/>
and stuff are more near the skin than adults.  Anyway, he &quot;scratched&quot; Lilly<br/>
in 8 places (elbow area on both arms, thumb area on both hands, near the big<br/>
toe on both feet and above the ankle on both sides).  That realigned her chi<br/>
I guess.  All I know is that things have been a TON easier since she has had<br/>
the treatments.  He told me that when she gets angry I can do the treatment<br/>
at home as well and I have and it has calmed her down.  If you google<br/>
accupuncture you might be able to find the exact places to &quot;scratch&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that was calming for her was rubbing her ears.  Supposedly<br/>
every part of your body is linked to a place on your ear.  This was very<br/>
helpful to her as well.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.  I am really not an expert though and I would advise you to<br/>
call your local accupuncturist.  He or she should be more than willing to<br/>
talk to you about it on the phone (usually after hours) to tell you about<br/>
it.<br/>
