Hi Kathy,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to mention that a couple of my sons are into surfing and skateboarding. On our last library trip, I borrowed some skateboard and surf magazines and videos. I also found a picture book - I Wished I&#39;d Surfed With the Duke - about surfing, and another with great pics and a bit of history. Oh, and a book on skateboarding tips. I am still looking for a bio of Tony Hawke. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I read these msyelf - they were fun and fascinating - and left them on the coffee table for the boys to peruse, if they wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
There is heaps of info around about your sons&#39; interests , so be enouraged!<br/>
<br/>
