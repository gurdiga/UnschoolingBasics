&quot;orange state&quot; meaning that some sort of oversight is used, but they<br/>
forgot that Florida also has an umbrella school policy (or as they<br/>
call it a &quot;600 school&quot;) where the only requirement is annual<br/>
attendance!  Which with that venue makes it more yellow than orange.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its not very accurate about Louisiana either.  We are listed as an <br/>
orange state. There are 2 options for homeschooling in Louisiana.  <br/>
<br/>
One requires lots of documentation - the other just a letter stating <br/>
that you operate a non-approved private school, the number of <br/>
children, your name and address.  You don&#39;t have to supply the <br/>
children&#39;s names or birthdates or records of any kind.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the more restrictive one is for the kids who want to qualify <br/>
for the TOPS program (money to go to college).  But I&#39;m not that sure <br/>
about it.  I just use the private school option and don&#39;t bother with <br/>
anything.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-287974152">Hi: my name is Tara and I just found this group.  My family lives in<br/>
Ct adn we are an ap, co sleeping, baby signing, ecing, cloth diapering<br/>
, homeschooling family.  all my children are grown up now but we take<br/>
in foster children.  I have found it is very beneficial to these<br/>
children to homeschool them while I have them.  right now I have only<br/>
a 4 month old little boy but we will also have a 16 yo girl who lives<br/>
in England  mother is very ill and wishes for us to take her when the<br/>
time comes.  so I am trying to get ready for her to come over.  <br/>
<br/>
recently I have been looking into unschooling and this little one<br/>
would probably do much better with this than a formal schooling either<br/>
in a formal school or in a home school environment so I am trying to<br/>
find out as much as I can quickly.<br/>

falls under &#39;homeschooling&#39; as far as legal stuff is concerned). With <br/>
foster kids, however, you might need to check even further and make <br/>
sure it&#39;s cool with the case workers and all. For the 16 yr old, it&#39;d <br/>
be great - for that matter, you could just never enroll her and <br/>
consider her &#39;graduated&#39; when she gets here since there is no law <br/>
requiring any paperwork be filed anywhere at all and just get on with <br/>
living life.<br/>
