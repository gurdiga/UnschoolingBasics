<div id="ygrps-yiv-713853056">Hi<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading and re-reading alot of posts here and have a question.  I<br/>
understand the no limit on tv & video/computer game.  But what about<br/>
content?  How do you decide if a certain program is appropriate for a<br/>
certain child?  I dont mean shows I don&#39;t personally like , I recently<br/>
watched that sci - fi cartoon &quot;Tripping the Rift&quot;. I found it funny but not<br/>
made for my 10 year old.  When I tell him that, isn&#39;t that limiting his<br/>
television?<br/>
What about music?  My 14 yr old gets upset when I wont let him buy what I<br/>
consider a mature cd.  And his agruement has merit, he says the things they<br/>
say in the songs he&#39;s heard before but I still have a problem with him<br/>
listening to this.<br/>
How do you all handle situations like this?  I&#39;m always telling my hubby to<br/>
try and let go, let them grow up and I find myself still trying to hang on<br/>
!!  LOL<br/>
You guys always have such good advice, alot of it is helping us get further<br/>
away from the traditions of p.s. and futher down the unschooling path.<br/>
Thanks a bunch,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; understand the no limit on tv & video/computer game.  But what about<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have found that my kids aren&#39;t interested in things that are too far above<br/>
their maturity level.  When they were littler I did wait until they were in<br/>
bed before I would watch movies that had content that I found inappropriate<br/>
for them. <br/>
<br/>
They knew there were things called R rated movies and at some point they<br/>
really wanted to see one just because I had limited them. (by purposefully<br/>
waiting for them to be asleep before watching one.)  When I finally eased<br/>
up, I found that they only were interested because we had limited them. They<br/>
made it a point to watch one or two and then they weren&#39;t interested anymore<br/>
because the movies were just not interesting to them.  They don&#39;t want to<br/>
watch things just because they are R rated anymore.  They don&#39;t have<br/>
interest in movies that are created for adults, for the most part.  They<br/>
just don&#39;t hold their interest.  Once in a while if we are watching<br/>
something rated R my youngest (almost 9) will come sit with us just because<br/>
she wants to be with us.  Nothing she sees on TV seems to bother her and she<br/>
knows better than to repeat what she hears among the uninitiated.  My older<br/>
dd (10) finds something else to do if she thinks a movie we are watching<br/>
will bother her.  (scary or otherwise)  <br/>
<br/>
To sum it up, as long as your kids know not to repeat what they hear, if<br/>
given the chance, they learn filter what they aren&#39;t ready for.  I am always<br/>
there to talk with them about anything they see that is too much for them<br/>
because they only reason they usually chose to watch something R rated is<br/>
when we are watching too.  On their own they still choose cartoons and horse<br/>
training shows.<br/>

<br/>
So rather than saying no to a movie, you find out if there are parts  <br/>
that would bother him. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.screenit.com">http://www.screenit.com</a> is a good resource.)  <br/>
If the movie still sounds intriguing despite the bothersome parts you  <br/>
*help* him acquire skills to deal with that so he&#39;s more powerful  <br/>
than a movie :-)<br/>
<br/>
Give him the power to fast forward/skip through parts he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
like, to stop a movie at any point, to go do something else until a  <br/>
bothersome scene is done, to shut his eyes. My daughter doesn&#39;t like  <br/>
moving skeletons so there&#39;s one scene in Lord of the Rings that she  <br/>
always closes her eyes on, and she&#39;s slowly gotten used to the  <br/>
skeletons in Pirates of the Caribbean so I think she&#39;ll watch most of  <br/>
those scenes now.<br/>
<br/>
If we stand in their way and then finally relent (or they&#39;re able to  <br/>
sneak it somewhere else), they&#39;ll watch a movie *even if it bothers  <br/>
them* because they had to fight so hard for the right to watch it.<br/>
<br/>
If they can watch anything they want, they won&#39;t sit through things  <br/>
that bother them -- *if* we give them the power over that thing.<br/>
<br/>
If the world is divided between what you&#39;re allowed to have and what  <br/>
you&#39;re forbidden to have, it&#39;s natural to want what&#39;s forbidden.  <br/>
(People wonder why they&#39;re being protected from the thing and it&#39;s a  <br/>
challenge to their self worth to want to prove that they can handle  <br/>
it.) When the world is divided between what you want and what you  <br/>
don&#39;t want there isn&#39;t a reason to investigate what you don&#39;t want! ;-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wouldn&#39;t you get upset if your husband decided what books you could  <br/>
buy for yourself? When we stand in someone&#39;s way of getting what they  <br/>
want it tells them we think something is more powerful than they are  <br/>
and we don&#39;t trust them, we don&#39;t think they&#39;re competent enough to  <br/>
handle something.<br/>
<br/>
What do you fear that will happen if your 14 yo listens to songs with  <br/>
mature content?<br/>
<br/>
The likely reactions are &quot;I&#39;m competent enough to handle this and  <br/>
I&#39;ll show you,&quot; or &quot;You&#39;re totally clueless about me and about this  <br/>
music and what&#39;s important to me so since you&#39;re being a roadblock  <br/>
I&#39;ll find a way around you,&quot; or he&#39;ll want to listen to it even if  <br/>
some of it makes him uncomfortable because he wants the power to choose.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to it with him :-) Ask him what he likes about it and really  <br/>
listen as you would a friend. Don&#39;t fear his ideas. If your home is  <br/>
loving and supportive, there&#39;s no reason for him to want a life  <br/>
that&#39;s about causing pain to others or having power over them. (Which  <br/>
is all the more reason to give him power now so that he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
equate power with freedom.)<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes it&#39;s interesting to try on ideas you don&#39;t want to see  <br/>
what they&#39;re like and what the world is like. As an example some  <br/>
unschooled kids like violent video games. They&#39;re fun *because* there  <br/>
aren&#39;t real life consequences to the actions. It&#39;s fun to explore  <br/>
what the would would be like if the rules were different. But that&#39;s  <br/>
not the same as wanting to live in that world! To have that world  <br/>
where people can be mowed down with a machine gun means giving up a  <br/>
loving, comfortable home. The trade off isn&#39;t worth it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-978322990">Hi Joyce,<br/>
Thanks, I think I truly knew all this but its good to see it said by someone else.  I know if my hubby tried to tell me what to do, see or read I&#39;d surely rebel.  I guess its a little hard to let him totally grow up.  But as long as he still comes to me before he goes to bed and gives me a hug and says our goodnight ritual we&#39;ll  be okay.<br/>
I want him to be independant but still alittle  dependant on me too.  <br/>
Teen years were difficult in the past, I have 2 adult children and one of which we had an extremely difficult time with.  This is why I have chosen to try and change they path we follow with our family & the 6 kiddies we are lucky to still have at home.<br/>
I love the advice you all have given me and enjoy reading all the replies to others postings.<br/>
<br/>

understand the no limit on tv & video/computer game.  But what about<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
Well, what exactly are you telling him? That he can&#39;t watch it? That he <br/>
might not like it? That you forbid it?<br/>
<br/>
Duncan will ask its rating---NOT that we&#39;re ratings-mided, but he <br/>
understands that movies/tv shows are rated for a reason. He&#39;ll ask why <br/>
it&#39;s rated such. I might say language, violence, or sexual content.  <br/>
The language doean&#39;t bother him at all (or me! &lt;g&gt;), but too much <br/>
violence disturbs him, and he just has NO use at all for on-screen sex <br/>
or sexual innuendo (if it doesn&#39;t already go right over his head!).<br/>
<br/>
Duncan has the choice to watch or not---and he trusts me to screen it <br/>
for him. So he&#39;s *self*-limiting. *He* doesn&#39;t want to watch it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
What about music?  My 14 yr old gets upset when I wont let him buy what <br/>
I<br/>
consider a mature cd.  And his agruement has merit, he says the things <br/>
they<br/>
say in the songs he&#39;s heard before but I still have a problem with him<br/>
listening to this.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s his money? And you&#39;re still telling him what to do with *his* <br/>
money?<br/>
<br/>
Well, buy him a set of earphones, and you won&#39;t have to listen to it! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll listen to it as soon as he&#39;s able--AND he&#39;ll hide it from you.<br/>
<br/>
Better to ask that he not listen to it in front of grandma or his young <br/>
cousins---to please be aware that not everyone shares his views on <br/>
music and to be considerate.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180436664">I&#39;ll even stretch things a bit and take this into the realm of video <br/>
games (oohhhh they&#39;re baaad all that violence and <br/>
language....&lt;wink&gt;) As Kelly implied, we give DS information (as she <br/>
does when she supplies info on ratings and reasons for the ratings). <br/>
When DS (7 yo) is looking at gaming magazines or ads on TV for new <br/>
games, he&#39;ll check the rating - he knows to look for words <br/>
like &quot;blood & gore&quot; and he&#39;ll ask about something if he sees <br/>
something he&#39;s not sure about (like sexual content). He&#39;s aware of <br/>
the TV rating things (since they pop up at the beginning of each <br/>
program) and we&#39;ve discussed them. In general, he picks stuff that <br/>
is of interest (lots of action, generally cartoons, except for some <br/>
food network stuff, mythbusters, and Who&#39;s Line) and skips that <br/>
which isn&#39;t (especially my favorite mysteries like Mystery Woman and <br/>
Monk and McBride). And, too, there are things he can watch at home <br/>
that he opted to skip in the theatrical releases (like Lord of the <br/>
Rings) because that is just too intense a setting. Summertime is <br/>
great because we can go to the drive in and see things on the big <br/>
screen but with more control of the setting (volume, etc) and he <br/>
likes that - we went and saw Star Wars III there - it wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
worked with him in a dark, loud theater but he loved it at the drive <br/>
in and is itching for the DVD to be released so we&#39;ll have the whole <br/>
set.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-486962004">Hi Kelly,<br/>
Thanks a bunch. I have gotten some great responses and advice here.   As far as tv goes, there is not alot that bothers me either. I think the ratings discussion is a good idea.  As I have sat back and watched my kids I see alot of maturity that I was missing (or maybe that I didnt want to see yet! )<br/>
The other day Alex came to me and asked me to listen to a cd he had bought, (which I guessed I wouldnt like), and said &quot;I recieved some great advice the other day and I&#39;d like you to play it&quot;. Well to say the least he was pleasantly suprised that I was willing to give it a shot. In the end I copied a song I liked but was honest with him, telling him I really didnt care for it.  And we discussed the appropriate listening venue when its a more mature cd, he was more than willing to move his radio to another part of the yard when the little ones are outside or put on some headphones.<br/>
<br/>
I believe we have taken another step down that yellow brick road !!!  Yee Haw !! <br/>
I think I&#39;m going to make a poster out of your final words.<br/>
<br/>
It gets easier and easier. I promise! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Patience. Time Trust. Respect.<br/>
 Thanks again !!  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll ask more advice in the future  before we make the final trek down the yellow brick road to the emerald city !<br/>

  It&#39;s his money? And you&#39;re still telling him what to do with *his* <br/>
  money?<br/>
<br/>
  Well, buy him a set of earphones, and you won&#39;t have to listen to it! <br/>
  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  He&#39;ll listen to it as soon as he&#39;s able--AND he&#39;ll hide it from you.<br/>
<br/>
  Better to ask that he not listen to it in front of grandma or his young <br/>
  cousins---to please be aware that not everyone shares his views on <br/>
  music and to be considerate.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  How do you all handle situations like this?  I&#39;m always telling my <br/>
  hubby to<br/>
  try and let go, let them grow up and I find myself still trying to hang <br/>
  on<br/>
  !!  LOL<br/>
  You guys always have such good advice, alot of it is helping us get <br/>
  further<br/>
  away from the traditions of p.s. and futher down the unschooling path.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  It gets easier and easier. I promise! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Patience. Time Trust. Respect.<br/>

Does this apply to sex and alcohol too?  So we should allow it all? (<br/>
This is a serious question.  )<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You bet---and I&#39;m as serious as a heart attack. How many of *you* told <br/>
your parents when you had sex? Drank too much? Smoked your first joint?<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I was legally an adult the first time I had sex. I <br/>
drank like a fish from 16 to 20. Never smoked pot.  Did my parents have <br/>
a clue? Did they &quot;allow&quot; it?<br/>
<br/>
But my son talks to me all the time about these things. I would <br/>
seriously rather have him be honest than sneaky.<br/>

  Hi Kelly, Thanks a bunch.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
You&#39;re very welcome.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 I have gotten some great responses and advice here.   As far as<br/>
tv goes, there is not alot that bothers me either. I think the ratings<br/>
discussion is a good idea.  As I have sat back and watched my kids I <br/>
see alot of<br/>
maturity that I was missing (or maybe that I didnt want to see yet! )<br/>
The other day Alex came to me and asked me to listen to a cd he had <br/>
bought,<br/>
(which I guessed I wouldnt like), and said &quot;I recieved some great <br/>
advice the<br/>
other day and I&#39;d like you to play it&quot;. Well to say the least he was <br/>
pleasantly<br/>
suprised that I was willing to give it a shot. In the end I copied a <br/>
song I<br/>
liked but was honest with him, telling him I really didnt care for it.  <br/>
And we<br/>
discussed the appropriate listening venue when its a more mature cd, he <br/>
was more<br/>
than willing to move his radio to another part of the yard when the <br/>
little ones<br/>
are outside or put on some headphones.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Very cool. It&#39;s amazing how reasonable hey can be when we give them our <br/>
time and honesty. I bet he thinks you&#39;re kind of reasonable too! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I believe we have taken another step down that yellow brick road !!!  <br/>
Yee Haw !!<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m going to make a poster out of your final words.<br/>
<br/>
It gets easier and easier. I promise! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Patience. Time Trust. Respect.<br/>
  Thanks again !!  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll ask more advice in the future  before <br/>
we make<br/>
the final trek down the yellow brick road to the emerald city !<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
I have so many little pieces of paper tacked to my kitchen <br/>
wall---brilliant little gems from Sandra and Anne and Pam(s), and <br/>
Deb(s) and Joyce and Zenmomma and Ren and Rue and Valerie and.... I had <br/>
books for a while will pages and pages of things that changed my life. <br/>
Unschooling Rocks! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
What you need to understand is that you can&#39;t prevent it.  Your kids are going to do what they are going to do, either behind your back or in a loving relationship with you.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have had access to alcohol since they were born.  The fridge in the garage is full of beer at this very minute.  The kids have had sips from a beer any time they asked.  Because it isn&#39;t some huge taboo, the kids go just by the taste in deciding whether to drink it, not some big &quot;I&#39;m a teen so I need to rebel&quot;.....and let&#39;s face it, beer is a bit of an acquired taste.<br/>
<br/>
My 14yo is starting to go out with boys.  I have a basket of condoms in the bathroom closet.  I told her about them, we talked about ethics, about responsibility, about that I love her no matter what.  I can&#39;t keep her from having all the sex she wants unless I lock her in the house....but I can make sure that if she has any concerns or questions she feels she can come to me.<br/>
