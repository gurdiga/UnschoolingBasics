<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965709399">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well yesterday on another list I am on (local to me) someone forwarded<br/>
another email from a radio person looking for people who were or thinking of<br/>
homeschooling kindergarten aged children. So I sent her an email and said I<br/>
would talk to her and my dd was 4.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So she called today and we talked for about 40 minutes. She seemed very open<br/>
minded and curious about how I came to the decision to homeschool. Well<br/>
eventually she started asking about our day and curriculums, because of<br/>
course everyone else who she had talked to for this article all use<br/>
curriculums. So it came out that I was not going to use one and that this<br/>
relaxed way of doing thing was called unschooling and that is what we were<br/>
doing, letting our dd chose what she wanted to learn and when and how etc.<br/>
So she is fascinated by this and now has asked to come to my home and meet<br/>
me and my dh and dd and spend some time with us! YIKES what have I done! <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She asked to come to a play group thingy we are doing weekly and I explained<br/>
to her that most of the families in that weren&#39;t even homeschoolers, let<br/>
alone unschoolers and that she wouldn&#39;t find all the moms hammering<br/>
teachable moments down their kids throats. That this was just a play group<br/>
and we chatted about what ever. So ok she gave up that idea. but of course<br/>
she doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; and is looking to see how I teach Hannah anything. So I<br/>
tried to explain that that didn&#39;t happen a lot, I mean for no other reason<br/>
than she is only 4 and even if I wasn&#39;t into unschooling I don&#39;t believe in<br/>
structured learning at this early age.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So what do I tell her. where do I take this interview. what points do I<br/>
make. how should I present it? Any suggestions? Hints? Support?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
How did I get myself into this!?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One thing I did notice was that I didn&#39;t sound as amateurish about this as I<br/>
felt. You people are rubbing off on me and I am learning so much from you<br/>
all. She asked me a bizarre question &quot;ok what about when she is older and in<br/>
a job and encounters a bully how will she know how to handle that?&quot; I was a<br/>
little surprised. My answer was &quot;you are assuming that people learn how to<br/>
handle a bully by being bullied. That isn&#39;t a fair assumption. She is<br/>
learning values and morals and personal boundaries every day in her life<br/>
right now, that will keep her from being a victim to a bully, not being<br/>
bullied. She won&#39;t learn those things in school because the way it works is<br/>
not to respect the individual but to respect conformity.&quot; I thought it was a<br/>
good answer. Then I used my own experiences in public school as an example -<br/>
I am no more prepared today to deal with someone shoving me down a flight of<br/>
stairs just because some girl did it to me in high school. I still wouldn&#39;t<br/>
know how to deal with it now except to call the police. So thank you for all<br/>
the teaching you are doing, I am growing and learning and I discovered<br/>
yesterday as I watched Hannah devour information on a Dr. Seuss computer<br/>
game, that I am actually enjoying being a parent for the very first time in<br/>
her entire life. That is because of this list and all I am learning, THANK<br/>
YOU ALL!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; and is looking to see how I teach Hannah anything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe talk about how 1 yos don&#39;t need to be prepared to be 2 yos. Just being<br/>
a 1 yo is how they become 2 yos. And being 3 is how they become 4. But<br/>
kindergarten and kindergarten curriculums don&#39;t help them be 5 or prepare<br/>
them to be 6. The curriculums are preparation for school. And that isn&#39;t the<br/>
same. Unschooling is about living in the world and learning by doing.<br/>
Schooling is about being put in a sterile artificial world and being told<br/>
about the real world. You don&#39;t want to prepare your child for that!<br/>
<br/>
You can talk about how learning is a side effect of doing. That kids don&#39;t<br/>
consciously learn English, for instance. They just use English to get<br/>
something they want and get better at English as a side effect of using it.<br/>
Not because they want to get better at English but because they want to get<br/>
better at getting what they want! :-)<br/>
<br/>
And that extends into everything they want to do and are interested in.<br/>
Writing and math and history and science are all tools that they&#39;ll use (and<br/>
get better at as a side effect) to do what interests them.<br/>
<br/>
Send her to Unschooling.com message boards for background research.<br/>
<br/>
My conference talk 2 years ago was about tools and why school think is so<br/>
attractive and why it&#39;s all an illusion.<br/>

GREAT answer!  :)<br/>
 <br/>
I did a public TV interview last year.  The host asked me if I had to  be a <br/>
certified teacher to be a homeschooler.  When I said no she asked  why not.  My <br/>
answer was that a certified teacher is someone who is trained  and hired to <br/>
educate large groups of children who are not their own.  I  don&#39;t consider <br/>
myself a teacher.  The education my children acquire while  they are with me falls <br/>
under my role as parent, as it has since recorded  history.<br/>
 <br/>
Or something like that.  :)  It&#39;s good to think of your answers  to common <br/>
questions ahead of time.  I didn&#39;t prepare for that one, but  I&#39;ve been doing <br/>
this so long I had thought about it before.  Good  on you for being a newbie <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I doubt she would get to come to the conference plus I think the article is<br/>
supposed to be on the radio next week, will have to find out. It is our<br/>
national radio station btw so this is a big deal! Hopefully I can use the<br/>
time to educate some people, so want to be sure that my answers show<br/>
unschooling in the very best light.<br/>
