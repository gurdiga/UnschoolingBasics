<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550302047">Just wanted to pop in real quick and say hi to everyone...and sorry<br/>
for being a lousy list owner and not keeping up with posts.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve made the move to Tennessee and we&#39;re freezing our butts off!!:)<br/>
It&#39;s so beautiful here though, and we LOVE our new house. I especially<br/>
love that we live only 3 hours from Ben and Kelly now. Yippeeee!!<br/>
<br/>
Through all the stress of moving there have been some really lovely<br/>
unschooling moments. I wish I had time to write them all down, but<br/>
Trevor is already antsy to have his computer back (hey, it didn&#39;t take<br/>
me that long to get rid of over 200 emails!!).<br/>
<br/>
The kids are loving it here, now I need to hook up with some cool<br/>
unschoolers. Brandi?:)<br/>

green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly<br/>
alive.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, Ren...I am so happy you guys are finally here! <br/>
And I didn&#39;t realize that we were so close to Kelly! <br/>
Very cool!  I&#39;m ready to meet up whenever you are<br/>
ready!<br/>
<br/>
And the cold...oh yes.  Still not as cold as some get<br/>
it, but you probably feel like us last year at this<br/>
time after moving here from So. California!<br/>
