  Are there any unschoolers in the Hydraxis realm? My 16 yo daughter is on that realm and I would love to have her connect with other homeschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349791723">We are on Haoramush, though my son has created toons on other realms <br/>
when ours isn&#39;t finished with the restart on Tuesday morning, that <br/>
way he can play sooner  :)<br/>
<br/>
My son is 7, and has a 76 alliance lock. I have a 58 mage, hubby has <br/>
a 72 rogue, and our daughters that are 4 share a 28 shaman. The girls <br/>
like to go around wetlands or exodar area and get the reindeer or <br/>
toads, skunks, squirrels, etc. My son doesn&#39;t read a lot, or type a <br/>
bunch, but sure knows how to use the mic  ;) He&#39;s really been into <br/>
raiding lately. He only needs the Oggrimar boss to get his black war <br/>
mount.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to find someone on our realm! We&#39;d probably even be willing <br/>
to level up a toon on another realm just to get to group up with some <br/>
fellow unschoolers!<br/>

We have quite a few characters on Argent Dawn and I know quite a few other unschooling friends that have just started characters there too.  Argent Dawn is a role playing realm but you don&#39;t have to role play to be on it.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to e-mail me if you&#39;re wanting to create characters there.  I have a 77 mage, and lots of other toons and my 2 daughters also have characters on that realm.  My son also plays but he&#39;s in a serious raiding guild on another realm.  He only plays now when he has a raid.<br/>
