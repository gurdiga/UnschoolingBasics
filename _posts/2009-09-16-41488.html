Hi,<br/>
My girls and I are moving to MDI (mount desert island...southwest harbor, Maine)....I<br/>
was wondering if anyone knows of any other families/support groups etc for us<br/>
unschoolers over that way somewhere??? Ellsworth MDI?...too bad we didn&#39;t have<br/>
one of those maps online that you just look up whatever area and you can see all<br/>
unschoolers around you...closest to furthest....<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-624110648">Hi Steph,<br/>
<br/>
I dont know of any of the support groups etc as I live in New Zealand, but I notice that your age gap between your children is the same as mine.  I now have dd 20, dd 18 & a ds 5.  Interesting gap.  The girls werent so sure about wanting another sibling, and definitely didnt want a brother, until he arrived, then they loved him to bits and its brought alot to their lives :)  I ws two days short of 41 when I had Mason.  Hope your pregnancy goes well :)<br/>
