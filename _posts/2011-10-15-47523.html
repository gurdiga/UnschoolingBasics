<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132867798">Hello everyone, <br/>
<br/>
I have these questions in my mind and would like to hear your responses:<br/>
<br/>
What make kids LIKE school? <br/>
They’ve been  molded, conformed, conditioned...they like their peers, social...<br/>
..and what else makes them really LIKE going to school?!<br/>
<br/>
Would an Unschooler Like school? If school mold, condition , conforms and control and take Freedom- why an Unschooler would LIKE going to school?<br/>
Could we assume/ consider that “something” went wrong while Unschooling, <br/>
Could we say that  the parents did Unschooling wrong?<br/>
<br/>

Some find the social dynamics fascinating, either for a little while or for years. School is a very different place when it&#39;s something chosen rather than forced.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Could we assume/ consider that âsomethingâ went wrong while Unschooling, <br/>
&gt; Could we say that  the parents did Unschooling wrong?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not necessarily. Some families don&#39;t have the resources to unschool successfully, or the age-appropriate local resources needed by a specific child are all inextricably tied to schools (I&#39;m thinking about team sports and band/orchestra in particular) - but that&#39;s not quite the same as saying the parents did something &quot;wrong&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
It is possible to &quot;fail&quot; at unschooling, though, if that&#39;s your question. You might find some of this helpful:<br/>

There&#39;s a &quot;how to fail at unschooling&quot; page somewhere in there, but I can&#39;t seem to find it at the moment - anyone have that link?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-782663282">An unschooler might like school if it’s his/her *choice* to be there and they can quit anytime.   The school might have opportunities that the family cannot otherwise afford, especially if they live in a  rural area, such as access to a science lab and it’s equipment, or access to an art or music teacher who inspires.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Some people love and thrive under structure, too, odd as it may seem.  There are other ways to get structure, but school is one of them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don’t think it always means that parents “failed” at unschooling.   <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What make kids LIKE school?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, pretty much the answer to any question of why an environment or  <br/>
method works with some kids and fails with others is how close the  <br/>
match is to the child&#39;s personality.<br/>
<br/>
Second, kids don&#39;t have a choice to be there. And one helpful value  <br/>
is: When life hands you lemons, make lemonade.<br/>
<br/>
So when kids say they like school, what does it mean? What are they  <br/>
comparing it to? Are they saying they like school better than being  <br/>
stuck at home with parents off working? Or stuck at home with a mom  <br/>
who hovers over them? Or acts as their teacher? What is their home  <br/>
like that they&#39;re imagining as the alternative to school? School tends  <br/>
to tear at relationships so they may not like their parents or  <br/>
siblings to spend much time with them.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect some kids would choose &quot;school&quot;, eg, going to a place to  <br/>
learn in a classroom setting if they could choose what they could  <br/>
learn. It wouldn&#39;t be much different from college. (College that  <br/>
someone has freely chosen to follow an interest.)<br/>
<br/>
But I doubt public school -- being required to be there, being  <br/>
required to learn what someone else has chosen for you -- fits any  <br/>
child&#39;s personality. But some kids will find enough at school that  <br/>
they do like and the rest ignorable to say they enjoy it. Social kids  <br/>
who find absorbing information easy would probably say they like  <br/>
school. Kids who enjoy sports, music, art and can get by with the  <br/>
rest, might enjoy it. Kids who like having what to learn laid out for  <br/>
them in a neat package might enjoy that part of it. (I liked that. I  <br/>
liked the sense that learning could come in neat packages. I was also  <br/>
good at absorbing information so getting good grades was easy for me.  <br/>
I&#39;m easy going. The social part was really hard for me, but what  <br/>
choice did I have? While I enjoyed home, the learning (on my own)  <br/>
there wasn&#39;t as challenging as at school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They�ve been molded, conformed, conditioned...they like their peers,  <br/>
&gt; social...<br/>
&gt; ..and what else makes them really LIKE going to school?!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think when imagining why someone would like something we hate, it&#39;s  <br/>
easy to stop at the assumption that they&#39;re defective, ignorant or  <br/>
somehow just bad people. It helps loads in accepting other people to  <br/>
know that everyone -- everyone who hasn&#39;t been severely damaged by  <br/>
life -- wants pretty much what you want: security, freedom, love,  <br/>
happiness. And it helps to imagine how they&#39;re getting the most  <br/>
important of those *to them* met by what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would an Unschooler Like school?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why assume all unschoolers are alike? Learning at home doesn&#39;t change  <br/>
kids inherent personalities.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter enjoys learning in a classroom setting. She didn&#39;t think  <br/>
much of the society at school, didn&#39;t think much of burned out  <br/>
teachers, and was plenty glad she could choose whether to go or not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If school mold, condition , conforms and control and take Freedom-  <br/>
&gt; why an Unschooler would LIKE going to school?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you speaking of a specific child? Strawmen children can be what  <br/>
if&#39;d into what sounds like reasonable situations but do those  <br/>
situations match any real children?<br/>
<br/>
And what do you mean by &quot;school&quot;? Learning in a classroom. Following a  <br/>
curriculum? Or being made to go to school. My daughter liked the  <br/>
first. I imagine some kids might like the second. I doubt any would  <br/>
like the last *if* the other alternatives were good. Some kids like  <br/>
school because it isn&#39;t home. If the home is bad, school can seem like  <br/>
a safe haven.<br/>

Pretty much the whole foundation of unschooling is that we learn by  <br/>
experience and not by someone else handing their experience to us for  <br/>
us to internalize as our own.<br/>

<br/>
What are the pros and cons of each?<br/>
<br/>
If you say she can&#39;t go then you&#39;ve increased the value of school. And  <br/>
she&#39;ll want to try it more. And if she then does try it she&#39;ll  <br/>
probably stick with it longer because she doesn&#39;t want you to &quot;win&quot;  <br/>

If she tries it, she&#39;ll learn what she likes and what she doesn&#39;t  <br/>

homeschool her. It&#39;s you deciding what&#39;s best for her and making her  <br/>
do it. That&#39;s exactly what schooling parents do. And *that&#39;s* what&#39;s  <br/>
damaging about school: people deciding they know what&#39;s best and then  <br/>
making you do it without any chance to opt out.<br/>

to blame others when they had no choice in what was done to them. If  <br/>
they have the choice, then *they* get to decide.<br/>

<br/>
Then in two weeks she&#39;ll have figured out the difference. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes home/unschooling parents get worked up about school, based on past experiences and forget a very important fact - you can always go back to home/unschooling. You won&#39;t even have that new-to-homeschooling panic that other parents have when they pull a kid out of school and don&#39;t know what to do next. <br/>
<br/>
If she Doesn&#39;t want to come home in a couple weeks or months, she&#39;s in school by her own choice - and that&#39;s a veeerrrry different experience than being &quot;stuck&quot; in school the way most kids are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you as a parent feel you know better?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes its hard for me to &quot;get over myself&quot;. Maybe I know &quot;better&quot; than my kid and maybe I don&#39;t. Maybe my kid needs to find something out her own way!<br/>
<br/>
Recently, my daughter wanted to go play laser tag with some friends in a floor length velvet dress. I &quot;knew&quot; it was a bad idea and the mom who was hosting the trip did, too - but Mo had her own plan so I sent an extra bag of clothes along just in case (because I &quot;knew better&quot;) and lo and behold, she mangaged just fine in her dress. Sometimes I don&#39;t know as much as I think I do ;)<br/>
