&gt;     Yes that is it. Also when trying to explain unschooling to DH ,who<br/>
&gt; is very supprtive of homeschooling-, he was very uneasy about it. He<br/>
&gt; is not a reader himself so I can&#39;t give him something to read on it<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Danette - I&#39;m not sure about your husband, but I can tell you how it went around here.  I told dh that I was looking into unschooling, probably the way we (kids and I) were headed.  Once I told him the basics that I had learned so far, he got to tell me what his concerns were.  Then I headed back to the books and answered those concerns.  Then he had more questions.  So I read up on those and we talked about that.  For my dh, my being able to tell him about real people that have been unschooling, and how they have handled things, has really helped him.  And I should add, that my husband&#39;s questioning me about unschooling wasn&#39;t because he thought we shouldn&#39;t do it!   It&#39;s just that I&#39;m the one that had the time to study up on it, and he wanted to be briefed.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I hear my husband answering questions about unschooling better than I could have answered those questions!  I heard him tell someone that he thought our children should have a &quot;cocktail party knowledge of literature.&quot;  (That means he thinks they should be able to handle the references to various classical literature that would come up at a cocktail party attended by &quot;educated&quot; people. )  My husband explained that he realized that the stuff that he knows, that he thinks our children should learn, he actually learned when he was in college!    <br/>
<br/>
And do come to the Live and Learn Conference in St. Louis in October, Danette!  My husband, Ken, will be there, along with lots of other men and their really nice families. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-749555518">Hi,<br/>
I read your post about unschooling basics and wondered if you could guide me as to where I could find out info on them.  I haven&#39;t been able to find anything of substance that would really explain to me the priciples of how it works, I&#39;ve only found opinions of how people feel about it.  Thanks for any help you can give me.  It sounds too hit and miss for us, but it could be that it just hasn&#39;t been explained properly.  Thanks so much.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It probably would sound hit and miss if you&#39;re expecting a list of <br/>
dos and don&#39;ts and &#39;shoulds&#39; like other &#39;educational methods&#39;. <br/>
Here&#39;s a list posted on another message board that someone wrote <br/>
summarizing the advice she was given when she was trying to figure <br/>
out how to start unschooling her DD. It really does cover a lot of <br/>
ground for thinking. Maybe it&#39;ll give you a place to start asking <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
1. There is really value in EVERYTHING in unschooling. <br/>
2. It&#39;s time for ME to de-school and examine all that I thought was <br/>
true about learning.<br/>
3. Initiate activities for me right now. <br/>
4. Leave her be for a while.<br/>
5. Connect with her where she NEEDS to be at this time in her life.<br/>
6. Join her in her world and use all of that time together as <br/>
starting points for great conversations. <br/>
7. Really *listen* to her thoughts about things. <br/>
8. Let her know that I want to learn about the world from HER eyes <br/>
and HER perspective. <br/>
9. Focus on Joy. Really. That&#39;s all I need to do right now. It&#39;s <br/>
vacation time in my home...bring on the Joy.<br/>
10. Do things for ME. Be curious. Ask questions and find answers. <br/>
Explore. Create. Build. Sing. <br/>
11. Unleash MY buried unschooling desires.<br/>
12. However many years she was in school, allow that many months (of <br/>
deschooling)<br/>
13. Treat her like a fun person rather than like a kid.<br/>
14. If I only look for academics I&#39;ll miss the real learning.<br/>

  Hi,<br/>
I read your post about unschooling basics and wondered if you could <br/>

First, I apologize for not responding sooner. I&#39;ve had my mind <br/>
elsewhere lately. Ren&#39;s computer&#39;s been down, so she&#39;s been unavailable <br/>
to any of us lately.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing I can tell you is to read here for a while---and to read <br/>
the archives.<br/>
<br/>
You can also go to UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups and read there. <br/>
Unschooling.info/forum is another good place to hang out. Someone here <br/>
may have the address for the archives of the now-defunct <br/>
unschooling.com message boards.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s site www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling is a wealth of info---not <br/>
just from Sandra, but from many, many excellent writers who really <br/>
understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I have an &quot;Unschooling Basics&quot; letter that I usually send out to <br/>
newbies in my state. I&#39;ll forward it here again in a minute.<br/>
<br/>
To me the principle is simply that children are hard-wired to learn. <br/>
They crave learning. They will search out the best paths for them if <br/>
given free choice and adequate information. They *want* to be good <br/>
people and live stimulating lives.  They can be trusted and are <br/>
deserving of respect.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s very &quot;hit & miss&quot;---but it may not be what you&#39;re <br/>
looking for.<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn&#39;t cut it, maybe you could be more specific?<br/>
