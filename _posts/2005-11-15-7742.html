<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385550433">This is related to unschooling, but not specifically about<br/>
unschooling. I just want to offer up an invitation to my &quot;imagination<br/>
tribe&quot; creativity list for anyone interested.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an unschooling list, anyone is welcome to join. The purpose<br/>
of that list is to encourage your creative voice, to give a safe place<br/>
for people to explore their own creative genius (or give resources to<br/>
help you re-claim that creative self if it&#39;s been damaged).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in the midst of planning an ATC trade in the mail. You (and<br/>
anyone you think would benefit from such a list) are welcome to join us. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/imaginationtribe/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/imaginationtribe/</a><br/>
<br/>
 The Imagination Tribe is the group responsible for creating that<br/>
lovely Circle Journal some of you may have seen at the conference.:) <br/>
I&#39;m going to try and keep some cool ideas available, so members have a<br/>
chance to try new things and come up with new ways to express themselves.<br/>
It&#39;s a lot of fun!<br/>
<br/>
