<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you (or dh) really think that they&#39;ll become better<br/>
&gt;at closing the freezer door by going to school?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hah! no, i certainly don&#39;t. i should have made it clear that dh is the<br/>
one who was ranting and raving, not me.  i was telling him to calm<br/>
down and get control of himself. he was threatening to sling the stuff<br/>
across the garage, at which point i told him he&#39;d better not! yes i<br/>
know what you are thinking. he is very immature in his reactions. he<br/>
has no parenting skills. his answer to things is punishment/violence.<br/>
often i try to stop him from the things he says and does, other times<br/>
i honestly don&#39;t know what to do. threatening to send them to school<br/>
is one of his favorites.  i&#39;ve learned a lot on this list, and have<br/>
been trying to see things differently....trying not to deliver<br/>
punishments, or consequences for their actions. trying to<br/>
let them have the freedom to make choices...when and what to eat etc.<br/>
<br/>
back to the freezer incident, i don&#39;t know which boy did it, they are<br/>
5 and 8. the older boy opened the freezer to put in a box of freezer<br/>
pops. the younger one may have opened it to check on them afterwards.<br/>
this was yesterday (sunday). no it doesn&#39;t matter who did it. i told<br/>
them and dh it was an accident and told my 8 yo i forgave him (hoping<br/>
that would help him feel better).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Could you involve them in salvaging the food? Could you<br/>
&gt;involve them in your budget and in deciding what needs<br/>
&gt;to be dropped because the money now needs to go for<br/>
&gt;groceries. I don&#39;t mean this in a punishment sort of<br/>
&gt;way, but the way you would deal with this if either<br/>
&gt;you or dh left the door open by mistake.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we could sell some of their toys on ebay to make up for it....they<br/>
have so many. but that might seem like a punishment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You didn&#39;t mention the age of your boys and how long<br/>
&gt;have you been homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they are 5 and 8, almost 6 and 9.  the oldest boy went to montessori<br/>
preschool/k 3 mornings a week at age 4, 5, and 6. then i was doing<br/>
FIAR with him. then last summer started sonlight with him...big<br/>
mistake there! had a baby at the end of nov, tried to start school<br/>
work back up jan 1, met with more resistance than ever before. was so<br/>
frustrated i put him in public 2nd grade for march, april and may. i<br/>
regretted it and still do! since then i have been investigating<br/>
unschooling.  the 5 yo went to a little preschool 2 mornings a week<br/>
this last fall and winter. part of me wants to unschool because it<br/>
seems so much easier, another part of me wants to do *some* work with<br/>
them. but nothing like we were doing with sonlight!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  You talk<br/>
&gt;about them disbeying but don&#39;t mention any specifics.<br/>
&gt;What behaviour is it that needs to be changed? I think<br/>
&gt;you&#39;ll get more helpful replies if you give specific<br/>
&gt;examples.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the specific things they were doing saturday, not limited to: running<br/>
through the house, making tons of noise, jumping off furniture,<br/>
throwing things, wrestling, hurting each other, throwing an entire<br/>
container of pompoms around the room, destroying things, and not<br/>
stopping when told to stop. or stopping for 30 seconds then starting<br/>
again.  wild, noisy, destructive behavior.  this went on for hours it<br/>
seems like.  I try to talk to them and interest them in other things.<br/>
 I guess I never suggest the right things. plus I have a 3 yo and the<br/>
baby. and of course lots of things to do. and pets to take care of. <br/>
the house is no where near clean and toys everywhere, and that gets<br/>
dh&#39;s panties in a bunch.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read on this list that it is ok to tell children to stop if they<br/>
are engaging in behaviors that bother other people (not in those<br/>
words).  I was trying so hard to do that.  They will not listen to me,<br/>
obey me, whatever word you want to use.  I ask them over and over to<br/>
stop.  the only thing that will stop them is when dh comes and yells<br/>
at them. he is fond of issuing threats that i don&#39;t agree with or that<br/>
could never be followed up on.  I just don&#39;t know what to do to have a<br/>
joyful household.<br/>
<br/>
I will write more later.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>

they&#39;re destroying things or hurting each other, we<br/>
don&#39;t interfere. So running around the house, jumping<br/>
or doing somersaults on furniture are normal<br/>
activities in my house. I think that they listen to my<br/>
&quot;No&quot;s and &quot;Stop&quot;s if there are fewer of them. Now I<br/>
don&#39;t have a toddler and a baby and you definitely<br/>
need to keep the little ones safe. But it sounds like<br/>
they need more outlets for their energy.<br/>

you? Like don&#39;t be so loud because the baby is<br/>
sleeping. Or don&#39;t throw toys because they may break<br/>
and it hurts when I step on them. (I discovered<br/>
yesterday that legos can really poke. So this is fresh<br/>
in my mind :)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to keep in mind - this is a process. I<br/>
have to say the same things again and again. They<br/>
often forget, but I&#39;m hoping it sticks over time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522937272">I had to LOL! on this, because I&#39;m thinking about four years ago we  <br/>
had an incident with stepping on toys. Primarily that it was really  <br/>
fun to roll them down our front entry and slam them off the front  <br/>
door. not a problem for me, it was lots of fun. however, when Bre&#39;s  <br/>
bussed pulled up, we had to hurry and quick to get her out the door.  <br/>
I stepped on one, flew backwards, wrenched my back out of place.  <br/>
Pinching that nerve was enough to deactivate my mitral valve (i have  <br/>
a bad heart) and next thing you know, I&#39;m in cardiac arrest on the  <br/>
floor, unable to move because my back is out of alignment, and the  <br/>
bus was still honking its horn outside. Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
So when I ask the kids to pick up, they know it&#39;s very seriously  <br/>
dangerous ;-) We all learned a lesson. I only wish it hadn&#39;t hurt so  <br/>
much on my end...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh boy.  You and the kids have my sympathy.  I wouldn&#39;t feel safe in <br/>
a situation like that if it were me.  Is there anyway to help your <br/>
husband understand that his temper tantrums are interfering with your <br/>
kids&#39; ability to be themselves and respond to their environment in a <br/>
positive way?  If he can possibly understand that, in the absence of <br/>
a safe and peaceful environment, everything they do is in response to <br/>
some adversarial input.  They&#39;re really not getting the chance to be <br/>
themselves!  And, he should understand that their responses are <br/>
actually entirely appropriate!  They&#39;re just trying to do the best <br/>
they can in that situation.  They&#39;re not being willfully disobedient; <br/>
they&#39;re being seen that way and they know it, so they have to do <br/>
things to either prove it or disprove it, and because of that, <br/>
they&#39;re not able to just be Who They Are.<br/>
<br/>

understand about how it works and how much does he support it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;we could sell some of their toys on ebay to make up for it....they<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s punitive!! Why should they have to give up something permanent <br/>
(like a toy) for something temporary (like food)?  Think of it this <br/>
way:  Let&#39;s say a house guest didn&#39;t know about the freezer door and <br/>
caused the food to spoil.  Would you present that person with a bill <br/>
or suggest that they sell their stuff to reimburse you for the <br/>
food.  Now, they might offer to do that for you, and that&#39;s <br/>
different.  In fact, your kids might offer to sell off some toys to <br/>
help cover the cost of the food, and that&#39;s entirely different.  But <br/>
you would never ask that house guest to do that, right? That would be <br/>
weird, no?<br/>
<br/>

&gt;stopping when told to stop.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two things come to my mind.  First, is that they&#39;re young kids who <br/>
need a safe place to be able to do big physical play run-around play <br/>
like that.  Second, though, is that point I brought up earlier.  I <br/>
believe you don&#39;t have their support because they don&#39;t have your <br/>
husband&#39;s support.  If they could feel a partnership from him they <br/>
would be more likely to respond to reasonable requests you may <br/>
have.  Being told to stop, though, is not reasonable in and of <br/>
itself, especially when they&#39;re feeling antsy and needing to move and <br/>
run and play!<br/>
<br/>

to find ways that your he can help rather than just criticize?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I just don&#39;t know what to do to have a<br/>
&gt;joyful household.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the first step has to be educating your husband about his <br/>
role in a joyful house.  He has to change first; then, I believe the <br/>
kids will be able to respond in kind.  Your husband has to understand <br/>
that he is the impediment to a joyful household!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my opinion, anyway, for what it&#39;s worth.<br/>

a gymnastics class or dance class or just a run around the block on<br/>
their bikes or scooters (with mom joining them).  When my kids seem to<br/>

you are joyfully living your lives?<br/>

&gt; trying to apply consequences to their actions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. Lying is a defense response. If someone know telling the  <br/>
truth will get them in trouble it&#39;s more reasonable to lie.<br/>
<br/>
If a policeman asked you if you caused a mess and you knew you&#39;d be  <br/>
fined and made to clean it up if you admitted it by telling the truth  <br/>
but could avoid both by lying, which would you choose?<br/>
<br/>
It seems we need to punish, though. If kids do wrong we need to teach  <br/>
them it was wrong by associating something bad with it.<br/>
<br/>
But despite our society&#39;s absolute conviction that that is necessary,  <br/>
it isn&#39;t. My daughter has never been punished and yet at 14 she&#39;s  <br/>
kind and thoughtful and doesn&#39;t leave the freezer door hanging open  <br/>
more than anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
And it isn&#39;t because she&#39;s a perfect kid. It&#39;s because I always  <br/>
assumed she meant well and was trying to do her best and helped her  <br/>
clean up the mess and figure out a better way when her decisions  <br/>
didn&#39;t turn out as she&#39;d planned.<br/>
<br/>
 From *kids* point of view our punishments are unreasonable. It&#39;s not  <br/>
that they don&#39;t understand that what they did was wrong, but  <br/>
punishment assumes that either:<br/>
<br/>
1)They did it accidently because they were unaware and that  <br/>
punishment will make them think next time.<br/>
<br/>
It makes them think parents are unreasonable and don&#39;t understand!  <br/>
But little kids are unaware of their environment. It&#39;s just the way  <br/>
their brains are wired -- or not yet wired really. Pain won&#39;t make  <br/>
those connections form faster. But it will put images of their  <br/>
parents as angry and hurtful in their heads. Is that how you want to  <br/>
be remembered? We can&#39;t control what they will remember of their  <br/>
childhood. We can&#39;t assume that one good time with them will replace  <br/>
one bad time.<br/>
<br/>
2) Or someone stood poised for a moment between a good decision and a  <br/>
bad one and chose the bad one deliberately.<br/>
<br/>
When we punish, kids know that both aren&#39;t true so the punishment is  <br/>
unreasonable. It shows we don&#39;t understand them and what&#39;s going on  <br/>
inside. It doesn&#39;t make them think more about what their being  <br/>
punished for. It makes them think less of their parents.<br/>
<br/>
And people who are treated unreasonably, who feel the world doesn&#39;t  <br/>
understand them, can lash out at the world. They&#39;re angry at being  <br/>
treated unfairly so they turn the anger back on the world.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are treated as though they are doing their best have no  <br/>
reason to punish the world.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than viewing your relationship with them as teaching them to  <br/>
act right, view it as being their partner and *helping* them get what  <br/>
they want in  the world. They&#39;re going to make mistakes. When they  <br/>
do, help them. Clean up the mess and help them find better ways.  <br/>
Rather than turning the kids into the problem, engage them in solving  <br/>
the problem. How can we keep the freezer door from being left open.  <br/>
(They may echo back your rules and that may feel satisfying. But you  <br/>
want new ideas because obviously the rules aren&#39;t working.)<br/>
<br/>
The thing about rules is they&#39;re a substitute for being there with  <br/>
them. Rules are a substitute for us being more mindful of what they  <br/>
could conceivably do. Rules are passing off our responsibilities onto  <br/>
a child -- without asking if they want responsibility! -- and then  <br/>
punishing the child when the child can&#39;t handle the responsibility.  <br/>
If we have breakables down where small children could pick them up,  <br/>
the solution isn&#39;t a rule not to touch. The solution is to put them  <br/>
up and be there to show them how to handle them gently. If a freezer  <br/>
door won&#39;t close, the solution isn&#39;t a rule, but fixing the freezer  <br/>
door, putting a lock on it, putting a gate around the freezer,  <br/>
putting it up high where the kids can&#39;t reach it ;-) But ultimately  <br/>
the children aren&#39;t responsible for keeping the food from defrosting.  <br/>
That&#39;s the parents&#39; job.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I explained the details in a different post. I felt the need to punish<br/>
&gt; because I didn&#39;t know what else to do!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids who are treated as though they can&#39;t be trusted often become  <br/>
kids who can&#39;t be trusted. The transition period from distrusting  <br/>
them to trusting them will be difficult! Do a lot of apologizing for  <br/>
past treatment. Tell them you&#39;re sorry you didn&#39;t know better but  <br/>
know you do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t know if they really understood, though I explained it numerous<br/>
&gt; times.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We do need to explain. We need information about how the world works  <br/>
out there. But we can&#39;t *depend* on them understanding. We can&#39;t hand  <br/>
them the information and expect them to handle it. We need to hold  <br/>
onto the responsibility over whatever we&#39;re explaining for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was right there.  Talking to them, trying to get them to stop.  <br/>
&gt; Trying not<br/>
&gt; to yell or be punitive. They kept right on. and on. and on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect they  hear no a lot. It&#39;s become a buzz in their ears.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than saying no, figure out how to say yes. Don&#39;t assume they  <br/>
want to destroy. If they&#39;re full of energy, they need to run. They  <br/>
may need to run more than you could believe possible. And to forge a  <br/>
good relationship, they need to feel as though their needs are your  <br/>
number one priority.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s going to be difficult! They&#39;re already convinced that their  <br/>
needs are secondary and come when it&#39;s convenient for parents. As  <br/>
much as parents *say* their kids are number one priority, more often  <br/>
it means after all the &quot;necessary&quot; things are done. And there&#39;s a  <br/>
*huge* list of necessary things: laundry, cleaning, dinner, shopping,  <br/>
spouse tending ....<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t always drop what we&#39;re doing but if we build up in them  <br/>
confidence that &quot;In a minute&quot; really means in a minute and not &quot;When  <br/>
it&#39;s convenient,&quot; and &quot;We&#39;ll do that soon,&quot; means we&#39;ll do that  <br/>
really soon and not &quot;If I wait long enough you&#39;ll forget.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I hope they learned that as a result of their not obeying, we were<br/>

&gt; would say I am never consistent enough and that I should definitely  <br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; have given in.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think following through on  what we promise is important.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t promising punishment is something we should be promising!<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t think you should have &quot;given in&quot;. I think it would have  <br/>
been better for your relationship, better for them to not view  <br/>
mistakes as needing punishment.<br/>
<br/>
If you were volunteering somewhere and you made a mistake, which  <br/>
person would you rather return to help: The person who ranted and  <br/>
raved and punished you for a mistake or the person who assumed you  <br/>
were doing your best and said &quot;Here, let me help you,&quot; and showed you  <br/>
how to do it again?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I should rephrase that.  I want them to be free to do what they  <br/>
&gt; want. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to control them. I want them to be able to make their own<br/>
&gt; choices. Not at the expense of the peace of the household. Not if  <br/>
&gt; it means<br/>
&gt; damaging things or making huge messes for me to clean up. Not if  <br/>
&gt; they can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; respect the needs of others.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of their destruction and disrespect is from hearing no and not  <br/>
being treated with respect.<br/>
<br/>
Part is probably because their kids and they need to be able to move  <br/>
energetically. They may need more frequent trips to the park, a mini  <br/>
trampoline, boffer swords and a back yard.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that you can&#39;t switch to treating them respectfully  <br/>
and then expect them to know that know you trust them. :-/ You have  <br/>
to regain their trust.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t though, mean letting them treat you and the house  <br/>
however they wish.  But rather than no, when they&#39;re being energetic,  <br/>
acknowledge that they&#39;re full of energy and help channel that energy  <br/>
in more positive directions until you can get them out.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike conventional parenting, mindful parenting doesn&#39;t have  <br/>
supposed magic bullets. There isn&#39;t solution Y for when kids are  <br/>
doing X. It&#39;s all about building up a trusting relationship with the  <br/>
kids so they *know* that you&#39;re their advocate, trying to help them  <br/>
get what they want and need.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I try to see it from their perspective.  You think 8 and 5 is really<br/>
&gt; little?  I think it is old enough to know better, old enough to  <br/>
&gt; understand<br/>
&gt; and remember things.  Am I wrong?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Their actions are showing you you&#39;re wrong! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Rather than looking at their age, look at *them*. No matter that most  <br/>
kids can read by 8 (or so) that doesn&#39;t help the child who won&#39;t read  <br/>
until 12 read sooner. It will only make them feel bad about  <br/>
themselves. They will read, be aware of their environment, be aware  <br/>
of their emotions and act rather than react when they&#39;re able and no  <br/>
amount of punishment or disapproval will make it happen sooner.  <br/>
(Though if may delay it! Or it may make it seem so unpleasant that  <br/>
kids don&#39;t want to.)<br/>
<br/>
Regaining their trust won&#39;t happen immediately. They&#39;re going to test  <br/>
you. If your husband cheated on you and then said &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I  <br/>
promise I&#39;m a changed person and it won&#39;t happen again,&quot; would you  <br/>
immediately trust him? What could he do to help you rebuild  <br/>
confidence in him? The more seriously he treats the wound in your  <br/>
confidence, the more responsibility he takes in proving that he&#39;s  <br/>
trustworthy, the more it will help.<br/>

This is way bigger than simply figuring out what to do about the <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
(BTW I agree with other posts that it sounds like the bigger kids <br/>
need more running room that they aren&#39;t getting cause you&#39;ve got <br/>
your hands full with the little ones. Finding ways for them to burn <br/>
energy - at-home things like punching bags, mini trampolines, actual <br/>
safe mats for wrestling around on, whatever and/or ways to get them <br/>
out to a park or something where they can run, even if that means <br/>
spending $20/week to hire a teenager to run around with them for a <br/>
few hours)<br/>
