<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040422670">This past week, Laurie (age 24), broke her watch. I had an analog <br/>
watch that I haven&#39;t worn in a few years because frankly, I don&#39;t <br/>
care what time it is. :-) I offered it to her and she decided it was <br/>
time to learn how to tell time with an analog watch. She never saw <br/>
the need before because digital clocks/watches are everywhere. She&#39;s <br/>
pretty tight with her money, saving every penny for the next five <br/>
years as she&#39;ll be in grad school, so she doesn&#39;t want to go out and <br/>
buy a new digital watch. I &#39;could&#39; have forced her to learn how to <br/>
read an analog clock years ago. I &#39;could&#39; have shamed her about not <br/>
knowing how. This way was so much easier. <br/>

Like John Holt said, It&#39;s never too late to learn.<br/>

them that they were going to &quot;help me&quot; by spontaneously asking me what time <br/>
it was. Many of my fellow students took great pleasure in &quot;helping me.&quot;<br/>
