<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494574698">I&#39;m sorry, this has very little to do with unschooling, yet sort of<br/>
has everything to do with my evolution through unschooling.  Plus,<br/>
I&#39;ve come to respect the opinions of so many of you and I&#39;m totally<br/>
lost.  <br/>
<br/>
When you are an adult and you have younger siblings (like 15 years<br/>
younger) how do you watch your parents treat them like crap and<br/>
completely ignore their needs?  Especially after being somewhere as<br/>
wonderful as the conference, this horrible parenting is standing out<br/>
so much worse right now.  <br/>
<br/>
I have this gigantic problem, and it&#39;s so much deeper than the above<br/>
question.  I just don&#39;t know where to begin or end.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a mother who I could soooooooo easily walk away from a<br/>
relationship with, yet I have two younger siblings (from her 2nd<br/>
marriage that no longer exists) whom I care about a great deal that<br/>
I&#39;d rather not alienate any worse than they already are.  IMO my<br/>
mother is ruining my little sister&#39;s life!  Their issues are mirroring<br/>
what we went through when I was that age.  It&#39;s tearing me up. <br/>
Especially, when I can see a solution!  It&#39;s right in front of my<br/>
eyes.  Yet, my mother is completely indoctrinated with the words of<br/>
school officials, psychologists, and well frankly, everyone but me. <br/>
She calls me up complaining of horrible issues with my sister and when<br/>
I offer up advice minimizes everything and suddenly the problems<br/>
practically don&#39;t exist anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
My mother called me today to ask my opinion regarding my sister (she&#39;s<br/>
14, not eating well, not sleeping well, doesn&#39;t like getting out of<br/>
bed for school, is EXTREMELY pale, thinner than normal, losing<br/>
friends, etc I think the answer is clear :-).  Anyway, you&#39;ll have to<br/>
trust me when I say she was not looking for my opinion, yet by using<br/>
my little sister as bait, she sucked me in to an argument about my<br/>
teenage life.  Dammit.  I fell for it.  I RARELY fall for her<br/>
invitations to chaos anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone been in a similar situation?  Does anyone have any advice?<br/>
 I&quot;ve have realized that there is nothing I can do to help my sister.<br/>
 I&#39;ve taken great lengths to help her and had them backfire.  Badly. <br/>
Should I just walk away and swear off her toxicity forever?  I&#39;m<br/>
really, really frustrated.  I want my sister to be &quot;happy and<br/>
healthy&quot;, but I&#39;m pretty sure this is out of my hands.  OH and too<br/>
make matters worse, she&#39;s (my mother) legally blind.  We live a few<br/>
blocks from each other.  If I DO walk away, I feel like the entire<br/>
city will think I&#39;ve abandoned my &quot;poor disabled mother&quot;.</div>

Is there any way she could come live with you? Or try to file for<br/>
emancipation? That may be far more than you can do right now but those<br/>
were two thoughts that came to mind.<br/>
<br/>
I think if there really is no way to support your sister, then cutting<br/>
off the toxic Mom makes a lot of sense. It sounds rough. Would your<br/>
Mom be open to something along the lines of &quot;it sounds like you&#39;re<br/>
having a really hard time with her Mom, why don&#39;t you have her some<br/>
stay with me for a couple of weeks so you can have a break?&quot; and try<br/>
to give your sister some mini-vacations at your place? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003092447">Those things have all popped into my mind as well.  Unfortunately, my<br/>
mother has made it very difficult for my sister and I to be &quot;sisters&quot;.<br/>
 She took my sister to counseling awhile back and told him that I was<br/>
a bad influence so he advised her to keep my sister &quot;protected from<br/>
me&quot;.   Errgggh.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to move.  South actually!  I moved to San Francisco when I<br/>
was teenager (18) and life was grand.  The mileage distance seemed to<br/>
keep us at an emotional distance at well.  But I have this feeling<br/>
breathing down my neck that says &quot;you can&#39;t run from your problems&quot;. <br/>
Well, that and husband who is not thrilled with the idea.<br/>
<br/>
I wish so much that she could have the life we are enjoying!  It&#39;s so<br/>
hard to give that up and let her suffer like she is.  I&#39;d love for her<br/>
to come unschool with us.  It would be GREAT!  *sigh*  time to move on<br/>
from that feeling I think too.  :-(<br/>

<br/>
That isn&#39;t running from your problems, that&#39;s minimizing them! I think<br/>
you need to give yourself permission to live exactly the life you<br/>
really want, including location and trust that it is possible. Once<br/>
you open that door and quit feeling the guilt, you might be amazed at<br/>
what can happen.<br/>
<br/>
Cutting toxic people out of your life is SMART. Just my .02.<br/>

As much as you may love your sister and think your mom is doing the <br/>
worst job ever, your sister is your *mother&#39;s* child. Not yours.<br/>
<br/>
Just as you might resent your mother&#39;s interference in *your* lives, <br/>
she may feel the same way about yours! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As long as your sister knows that you love and care about her, you will <br/>
probably be able to reconnect in the future. Let her know you&#39;re there <br/>
for her always.<br/>
<br/>
But your mother needs just as much freedom to bring up *her* child as <br/>
*you* do yours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-933808477">Again thanks.  I should hang that on my wall.  It might help me walk<br/>
away.  Luckily, thats a thought my mother has never heard.  In fact, I<br/>
don&#39;t think she even knows what unschooling is.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Funny, my brother said the same thing.  &quot;We can reconnect later&quot;. <br/>
Oddly enough, like my brother and I did.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think just being there, unobtrusively, for her will be a huge thing.<br/>
I know, as an abused child, It took just one person to validate that I<br/>
was ok and that the abuse/neglegent treatment, etc were NOT my fault.<br/>
It may take your sister years of therapy or soul searching to get out<br/>
of this space she&#39;s in, but you CAN make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
I find that with my mother if I just listen without emotionally<br/>
involving myself I can allow her to talk herself out and come to her<br/>
own conclusions. She feels heard and supported and I haven&#39;t allowed<br/>
her to control me. That being said, I completely released contact with<br/>
my father. Our relationship was just too toxic. I still consider doing<br/>
that with my mother but haven&#39;t decided to yet.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you clear vision and compassion for yourself,<br/>
Faith<br/>
