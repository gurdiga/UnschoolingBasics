<br/>
I don&#39;t agree.  Most religions are open to the fact that there are other valid religions.  Christianity, of course, holds itself as the ONLY way, but most others don&#39;t.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Jaiden Jason and I have been talking about this a bunch more and <br/>

&gt; Okay here&#39;s my stab at it. I love this kind of stuff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;If a bunch of other people like your sandwich and want it the <br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;If your sandwich has been selling and then nobody wants to buy <br/>

&gt; alone. No one else needs to like it the same way. It feeds you and <br/>

So I&#39;d think they acknowledge that people make other sandwiches, but any religious dogma would say that the sandwich is not made in the right way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782270453">Religions are really diverse. I&#39;m a part of a religion that doesn&#39;t  <br/>
talk about salvation or enlightenment...or have creeds...or a  <br/>
proscribed path...and yet we are a well-established religion, not a  <br/>
fringe or a cult or merely &quot;spirituality.&quot; I&#39;ve been cringing a bit  <br/>
at the &quot;religions do this&quot; and &quot;religions do that&quot; talk.<br/>
<br/>
My religion is also traditionally Christian (though we&#39;re not all  <br/>
Christians; I&#39;m not). Even at the height of its Christianity, it  <br/>
didn&#39;t consider itself the only valid religion...but it was  <br/>
definitely Christian. &quot;Christianity&quot; is also a really diverse  <br/>
phenomenon.<br/>
<br/>
Just feeling uncomfortable with the generalizations, I guess.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s probably time to end this discussion anyway.<br/>
