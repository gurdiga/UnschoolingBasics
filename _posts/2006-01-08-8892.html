<div id="ygrps-yiv-403523819">Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Cari, mother of 2 little girls, Leanah(6) and Navah(4). This is <br/>
our first official year of hsing, but as far as I&#39;m concerned we <br/>
have been hsing since they came out of the womb!<br/>
I am curious to hear about how you other mom&#39;s go about your days. I <br/>
want to hear about how you &quot;schedule&quot; your day as unschooling moms. <br/>
Since this is our first year, we started off with a plan that was <br/>
obliterated in about three weeks. I tried doing the Charlotte Mason <br/>
type of thing, which I really like. After reading Moore&#39;s books I <br/>
realized Leanah is too young for all that sit-down work, even though <br/>
she loves reading, writing, and creating. I tried 5 in a Row, which <br/>
also exhausted me. The girls love 5 in a Row, but it takes so much <br/>
out of me to &quot;put out&quot; like that each day. What I dislike most about <br/>
it is that I feel like my girls are looking to me to entertain them <br/>
with school, ya know? I want them to be looking for interesting <br/>
things to learn/discuss, especially my six year old. My almost five <br/>
year old happily does whatever sis is doing most of the time...am I <br/>
freaking out about nothing? HELLLPPP!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647806080"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; she loves reading, writing, and creating. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then do just that.....help her get the books for reading, paper for <br/>
writing, and supplies (paint? clay? beads?) she needs for whatever <br/>
she wants to &quot;create.&quot;  Let her go to it...just be around to help if <br/>
she asks for it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well -- in a nutshell, yes (am I freaking out over nothing?) :-)  <br/>
Your girls (both of them) are still SO young...they could <br/>
literally &#39;just play&#39; all day and it would be perfectly normal and <br/>
natural.  If you take them places with you (shopping, appointments, <br/>
occasional museum, park, &quot;fun&quot; place) -- that&#39;s all they &quot;need.&quot;   <br/>
Quite honestly, I think 5 and 6 are too young to be looking <br/>
for &quot;interesting&quot; things to learn and discuss (no disrespect intended <br/>
to you with that comment).  We, as parents, have all those schooly <br/>
voices inside of us (and outside of us!)telling us what our kids need <br/>
to LEARN.<br/>
<br/>
The most difficult concept for me to &quot;get&quot; about unschooling is that <br/>
I had to let go of the idea that the kids had to be learning or doing <br/>
something &quot;productive.&quot;  You have to understand that, especially with <br/>
kids so young, PLAY is the most important thing...and play is <br/>
learning.  <br/>
<br/>
Welcome here...you will find much wisdom from these wonderful women.  <br/>
Also, go to the files and links section and read the articles/info <br/>
regarding the philosophy of unschooling.  Search the net on <br/>
unschooling...there&#39;s a ton o stuff out there.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520899486">If having lots of books to read and crafty stuff available to create <br/>
with is what they like, go for it - max out your library card (BTW <br/>
our library allows an &#39;associate&#39; card for 5 and 6 yr olds so each <br/>
girl could have her own card as well as you having one and make sure <br/>
DH has one so you can get huge stacks of books!) We have a low <br/>
cabinet that holds all craft type supplies readily accessible for DS <br/>
(and me and DH too). One thing we like is to buy big rolls of brown <br/>
paper and cover the kitchen table. We can do all sorts of &#39;projects&#39; <br/>
without worrying about messes because it just rolls up and goes in <br/>
the trash. And we can use it to draw on as well - or rough out <br/>
grocery lists or explain the concept of place in numbers (ones, <br/>
tens, hundreds, etc) or invent monsters or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
DS is 7 1/2 and his day is roughly:<br/>
get up somewhere between 7 and 9 am. Watch TV a bit as he wakes up <br/>
usually (often The Weather Channel). Play computer games or video <br/>
games with DH (the at home parent, I WOH fulltime). Eat somewhere in <br/>
there. Play more games of various sorts, build things with various <br/>
materials (legos, knex, etc), watch TV, etc. Eat again eventually. <br/>
Play more - which may or may not include going outside to play, <br/>
going to a friend&#39;s house (Friday afternoons are a standing playdate <br/>
with some homeschooling friends), running an errand or two, etc. <br/>
Dinner occurs when I get home from work. More TV, games, etc occurs <br/>
in the evening, with the quieter, more sedentary types occurring <br/>
closer to when I head to bed (since I am the only one with a wake up <br/>
time, I&#39;m the only one with anything approaching a &#39;bedtime&#39;), might <br/>
include a bath for one or several of us - I *love* hot bubble baths <br/>
(with a big thick novel) and my guys got me a lovely bathtub pillow <br/>
and some bubble bath and bath salts for Christmas so I&#39;ve been <br/>
having LOTS of bubble baths lately. DS may choose a bath time as <br/>
well some evenings. Right now my boys are into &quot;BrikWars&quot; which is a <br/>
miniatures game with Lego bricks and Lego mini figures. It has a <br/>
whole set of rules and strategies and all. And you use Lego bricks <br/>
to make the buildings, redesign the buildings, etc. Last night, DH <br/>
made an armored personnel carrier to use in the game. Pretty cool! <br/>
That has been occupying a lot of their time lately. We&#39;ve also had <br/>
lots of piratey stuff going on (probably influenced somewhat by <br/>
Spongebob). Cooking and housework happen in there as well. It looks <br/>
a lot like life in general - the way life looked at your house most <br/>
likely before your girls got to &#39;school age&#39;.<br/>
