<div id="ygrps-yiv-820033832">Hi Malinda!!  How exciting to find a post from someone in Fairbanks <br/>
Alaska!!  I am Heidi, Ren&#39;s sister.  I currently live in Wasilla but <br/>
we only moved here three years ago, from Fairbanks.  We leave in two <br/>
weeks to embark on a one-year long RV trip around the country before <br/>
we settle somewhere (not Alaska).  I was born and raised in <br/>
Fairbanks and have been dying to get out since I was a young teen!  <br/>
I do know LOTS of people in Fairbanks but I would love to give you a <br/>
name of a very fun unschooling family there, they have a boy (Ryan) <br/>
that I think is 10 now, maybe getting close to 11.  He is a very <br/>
lively, interesting kid!  She also has three girls, all younger than <br/>
Ryan.  They are very unschooly but not TOTALLY unschoolers.  They do <br/>
a little workbook stuff, just enough to satisfy the program that <br/>
they are in so that they get there money but really unschoolers at <br/>
heart, or at least VERY supportive of unschoolers,if you kwim.  If <br/>
you would like her name let me know and I will call her to make sure <br/>
she is okay with that, I&#39;m sure she is but I like to give people the <br/>
courtesy.  I can only get internet once in a while (whoever has wi-<br/>
fi) so if I don&#39;t post right away that is why.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-224401224">Hi Heidi!  We&#39;ve been in Fairbanks for nearly two years (military family), and I think we have found &quot;home.&quot;  You never know, however, since we tend to be quite nomadic and not just because of the military lifestyle.  We must have a bit of gypsy blood in us. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I would really appreciate getting connected with other unschooling families.  If you&#39;d like, your friend could contact me by email if she&#39;d like (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:saprswife@...">saprswife@...</a>).  I know it&#39;s a really busy time with the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for taking the time to welcome me, as I&#39;m sure you are incredibly busy right now!  Your trip sounds absolutely wonderful!  I know my family would love to do something like that one day. :o)<br/>
