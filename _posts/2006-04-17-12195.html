<div id="ygrps-yiv-784221121"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m not sure why parents who don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; give their children a<br/>
&gt; choice ask their children to do things. Why not just<br/>
&gt; tell them, &quot;Do the<br/>
&gt; dishes.&quot;  I&#39;ve noticed that parents who &quot;ask&quot; their<br/>
&gt; children to do something<br/>
&gt; and the child exercises their free will to not do<br/>
&gt; that thing will then say,<br/>
&gt; &quot;I ASKED you to do that and you disobeyed me.&quot; <br/>
&gt; Hmmmm.  Asking equates to<br/>
&gt; requirement.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OUCH! (*cringe*) I just said something similar to my<br/>
son last night and immediately regretted it. Your post<br/>
helped me realize why I was uncomfortable with what I<br/>
had said. <br/>
<br/>
My son (9) has recently developed the habit of<br/>
dropping everything - shoes, toys, bike helmet,<br/>
food...whatever he has in his hands - *right* in front<br/>
of the main door and everyone keeps tripping over the<br/>
pile. The area where he leaves his things is also<br/>
right at the bottom of the stairs. He took the dog out<br/>
for a walk when we got home from our family&#39;s Easter<br/>
dinner last night and left his shoes on the bottom<br/>
step. I came down the stairs with a load of laundry<br/>
and tripped over his shoes. I said &quot;Cameron, I have<br/>
*ASKED* you not to put your things right in front of<br/>
the door/at the bottom of the stairs more times than I<br/>
can count lately and you still did it *again*! Please<br/>
get your shoes out of the way before someone really<br/>
gets hurt!&quot; I was frustrated so it came out more<br/>
harshly than I meant it to, so he got upset because I<br/>
was &quot;yelling&quot; at him. <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize at the time that I had been<br/>
*expecting* that he would either do as I asked or give<br/>
me his reason for saying &quot;no&quot;. There has rarely been a<br/>
time when he didn&#39;t do one of those two things, so I<br/>
just *assumed* that he would in this case as well.<br/>
Instead he has been agreeing with my explanations<br/>
about why this was not a safe place to put his stuff<br/>
and moving them when I asked, but continuing to drop<br/>
his stuff there until I either asked him to move them<br/>
or I moved them myself. This goes on many, many times<br/>
a day. He has also been leaving a trail of clothes,<br/>
dirty dishes and trash wherever he goes in the house.<br/>
This is a completely new way of acting for him. Before<br/>
now he has always put his clothes in the hamper,<br/>
rinsed his own dishes, put away most of his things<br/>
himself, and thrown away his trash (candy wrappers and<br/>
such). Not at our insistence but just because that&#39;s<br/>
the way he&#39;s always been. When he was a toddler he<br/>
just emulated us and has continued to do so. We never<br/>
really had to ask, he just did these things. Now,<br/>
however, it&#39;s like he&#39;s walking around in a daze and<br/>
doesn&#39;t even realize what he&#39;s doing.   <br/>
<br/>
It hasn&#39;t escaped my attention that this change in his<br/>
behavior coincided with him suddenly looking and<br/>
acting &quot;older&quot;. Around the time of his last growth<br/>
spurt he started becoming more muscular, getting acne<br/>
and talking about girls as if he&#39;s aware of them as<br/>
more than just playmates (though he&#39;s not quite ready<br/>
to &quot;like&quot; them just yet). He has also been worrying<br/>
about how his hair looks (he used to be famous for his<br/>
&quot;bed head&quot;) and even asked me to buy him deodorant the<br/>
other day. I have to wonder if it is all related. <br/>
<br/>
Not sure how this will all work out. We&#39;ll just play<br/>
it by ear as usual I suppose. He&#39;s my oldest so I feel<br/>
like I&#39;m fumbling in the dark most of the time.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ll stop rambling now. All I really meant to<br/>
say was &quot;thanks&quot; for your wording. It really helped me<br/>
see my part of the situation last night more clearly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s your job to attend to their safety. You can try various things  <br/>
to fix problems but ultimately the responsibility is yours.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I put out a basket in the same area can you agree to toss ytou  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When children leave things out it&#39;s not because they&#39;re lazy, it&#39;s  <br/>
because they just aren&#39;t aware. They&#39;re so focused on what they&#39;re  <br/>
doing next that they aren&#39;t aware of what they&#39;re doing now.<br/>
<br/>
We have a dark bathroom that&#39;s off a bright hallway. Though I&#39;m very  <br/>
conscious of conserving electricity, as I&#39;m coming out of the  <br/>
bathroom into the bright hall, there isn&#39;t a visual clue to remind me  <br/>
the light&#39;s on so I more often than not I forget to turn it off. I  <br/>
already care about electricity. I can&#39;t be more aware. Should my  <br/>
family yell at me? Should my family make me stop what I was doing to  <br/>
go turn off the light? I think that would just create tension in our  <br/>
relationships. What would work is if someone sees the light on to  <br/>
turn it off! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Some people are just oblivious to their surrounds. Especially kids.  <br/>
The bathroom sink had gotten pretty dirty and every time I&#39;d look at  <br/>
it I&#39;d sigh in irritation. But my husband would even see it. Then one  <br/>
day he cleaned out his electric razor and decided to wipe the hairs  <br/>
out and disturbed the thick film on it and was surprised. He really  <br/>
and truly hadn&#39;t seen the dirt before that. (Lucky me! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Trust that your kids are doing the best they can with the skills they  <br/>
have. When you&#39;re there, you can say &quot;Shoes,&quot; and they&#39;ll know what  <br/>
you mean. When they aren&#39;t there, just pick them up.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have a shoe basket.  It sits right inside the front door.  We&#39;ve had one<br/>
forever basically because I hate wearing shoes in the house.  There are<br/>
usually shoes around the shoe basket but not necessarily IN the shoe basket<br/>
and sometimes the shoes are other places in the house.  I don&#39;t require that<br/>
shoes go in the basket.  My son sometimes is so engrossed in getting through<br/>
with bathroom &quot;duties&quot; so he can get back to what he was doing that he<br/>
forgets to flush the toilet.  I tired of reminding him and the girls would<br/>
refuse to do it for him.  So I stamped him a little sign and had it<br/>
laminated.  I hung it at eye level.  It simply says &quot;Flush&quot;  I also made<br/>
some other signs like Wash, Brush, and Lights as visual reminders for him.<br/>
He doesn&#39;t always do them, but it sure does bring up conversations when we<br/>
have guests :)<br/>

  :) Im sorry.......someone wrote an e-mail about their son leaving shoes at the bottom of stairs n such .....was just mentioning what I do here with my littles as one of many possible solutions. ( Of course they only do what they are supposed to about 25% of the time ) <br/>
