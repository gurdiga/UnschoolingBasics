<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920516964">Thanks everyone for the advice.  We are thinking that we will do  grandma&#39;s <br/>
house during the day.  In NY where we are, the laws are kind of  strict, but <br/>
no, there&#39;s nothing about time that you need to be home to  &quot;homeschool&quot;. You <br/>
just have to do a minimum number of days and turn in tons of  paperwork at <br/>
certain times (each quarter) of the schoolyear, but all that can be  handled.  I <br/>
think I have enough &quot;school-speak&quot; (you know that language  educators use to <br/>
sound important) to make our paperwork sound just fine, even  without formal <br/>
&quot;school times&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
I am starting to wonder however what my own job (superindentant and  <br/>
principal) will think when they find out (it&#39;s a small area even though I don&#39;t  work <br/>
in the district we live in).  I don&#39;t have tenure in my district since  we <br/>
just moved and it&#39;ll be interesting to see if this gets in the way of that  <br/>
happening for me.  Oh well, that was just a side thought.  I know  there are lots <br/>
of other p.s. teachers out there who homeschool, probably being  teachers in ps <br/>
drives them to homeschool more like.<br/>
