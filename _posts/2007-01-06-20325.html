that are told yes learn how to figure things out when they come upon <br/>

think of creative ways to get what they want and need.  <br/>
<br/>
We are tight on money right now and we haven&#39;t been in this position <br/>
for many years.  My kids have always pretty much gotten what they <br/>

computer broke down and we can&#39;t replace it and it isn&#39;t fixable.  <br/>
We looked at a few options that he had come up with, including <br/>
finding a casing the same as his and switching the inside of his <br/>
computer.  We couldn&#39;t find one cheap enough so he eventually <br/>
decided he is going to get a job so he can buy his own.  Which <br/>
brings us to the other subject of motivation.  This is a child who <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a &quot;normal&quot; schedule, stays up until all hours of the <br/>
night and sleeps most of the day, which some have been critical of.  <br/>
How is he going to learn how to live in the real world and have a <br/>
job etc.?  When they have something that motivates them they will do <br/>
amazing things!<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; I remember one time we were visiting family in Alaska and did a <br/>
trip to the grocery store with my sister. As we walked the aisles, <br/>
Sierra asked for certain items and we picked up whatever she wanted. <br/>
By the third request, my sister says &quot;Sierra, does your mother EVER <br/>
tell you &#39;no&#39;?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming this was Robin.  I hope I didn&#39;t make such a stupid <br/>
comment!  And how funny that I don&#39;t think I have ever heard her <br/>
tell Rylee no!</div>

<br/>
You know it!!:) I think it was when Rylee was a baby...my how some<br/>
things have changed eh?<br/>
<br/>
There was a really great discussion amongst a small group of us at the<br/>
 Live and Learn conference in Albuquerque last year, in between<br/>
activities. Barbara Chase mentioned how saying &quot;yes&quot; to everything<br/>
without any thought can be just as mindless as saying &quot;no&quot; without<br/>
thought.<br/>
<br/>
The entire point is that we act more MINDFULLY of our actions and<br/>
choices, including our interactions with our children. If we really<br/>
think about WHY we are answering a certain way, if we really examine<br/>
the motivations and such, I think we can find that place where the<br/>
answer is done with thoughtfulness.<br/>
<br/>
If we say &quot;yes&quot; with no thought as to WHY we&#39;re saying it, or HOW to<br/>
meet the request, we may find ourselves at odds with our own world.<br/>
The point isn&#39;t to ignore our own needs, or ignore natural<br/>
limitations, but rather to get outside the box and be creative!!<br/>
<br/>
So many, many things that parents seem to automatically say &quot;no&quot; to<br/>
are pretty easy to navigate with some brainstorming and flexibility.<br/>
That thought process of &quot;how can we make this work for everyone?&quot; is<br/>
SUCH a healthy way to approach challenges rather than a kneejerk<br/>
answer. Considering all angles and everyone&#39;s needs allows for many<br/>
different solutions to surface and encourages children to contribute<br/>
without feeling their desires are somehow &quot;wrong&quot; because an adult is<br/>
putting a stop to it.<br/>
<br/>
There ARE &quot;no&#39;s&quot; in life, but how do we approach them? With an open,<br/>
flexible mind or with the idea that life sucks and we need to learn<br/>
how to deal with it? Too many of us were taught that attitude and<br/>
unschooling gives us an opportunity to heal those attitudes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-818584141">I would like to offer my experience with changing from saying *no* to<br/>
*yes*.  When I can&#39;t give my kids an outright &#39;yes&#39; due to whatever<br/>
circumstances prevent it (ie money, time etc), they have become VERY<br/>
creative at negotiating or working out ways to get what they are after via a<br/>
different route.  It is great to see because I know when I was their age I<br/>
would just hear &#39;no&#39; (often) and stop there. And quite often when they are<br/>
trying to work out a solution I have time to *hear* that perhaps the reasons<br/>
for my *maybe* are sometimes due to my lack of confidence or hesitancy in a<br/>
situation that should be embraced.<br/>
