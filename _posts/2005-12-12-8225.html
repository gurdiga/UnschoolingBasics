<div id="ygrps-yiv-628321189">I have been reading the thread about chores, and this is mostly how <br/>
I do things too. (My oldest is four.) But I have one concern that <br/>
I&#39;m hoping you guys can clarify for me:<br/>
<br/>
If you regularly clean up their room and toys, etc, as a &quot;gift&quot; to <br/>
them, don&#39;t they grow up thinking that picking up is not their <br/>
problem or responsibility, that some one is always going to come <br/>
along and do it for them? <br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t that lead to going to other people&#39;s houses, say, for <br/>
dinner, and just walking away when they&#39;re done eating because, hey, <br/>
putting away dishes and helping clear tables isn&#39;t something *I* do -<br/>
- other people are supposed to do it for me? Or wouldn&#39;t it make <br/>
them have no qualms about littering, because, hey, at home, I make <br/>
all kinds of messes and no one complains or expects me to clean it <br/>
up? Wouldn&#39;t it lead to think of your parents as your personal <br/>
servants and to treat them with a sort of &quot;I snap my fingers and you <br/>
jump&quot; kind of attitude?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously the answer to this is not &quot;Yes,&quot; but if someone would <br/>
explain WHY it doesn&#39;t work that way, (because to me it seems like <br/>
it would), I would appreciate it.<br/>

<br/>
It is amazing isn&#39;t it? It seems so counter-intuitive because it is so the<br/>
opposite of conventional parenting and cultural expectations.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is simply because children live up to what is modeled for them<br/>
and how they are treated. What is being modeled (by the cleaning gifts and<br/>
presumably parental courteous behavior when dining at friends&#39; homes) are<br/>
the Principles of Kindness, Giving and Consideration for Others, instead of<br/>
the idea of &quot;Every one *has to* take of themselves because no-one will help<br/>
you&quot; or &quot;You are a bad person if you don&#39;t do things for others, but no-one<br/>
will do things for you&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The children have the experience of Generosity, and end up wanting to give<br/>
to others freely. They are not carrying resentments from being forced, or<br/>
judged negatively or the feeling like they are held to a higher standard<br/>
than the adults in their lives. They are not waiting for the moment that<br/>
they are out from under anyone&#39;s thumb to behave as they would wish to. They<br/>
are not acting from a wellspring of installed guilt.<br/>

I have to say that I wonder the same thing, about how children  might begin<br/>
to EXPECT that everyone is there to wait on them, and also may not be<br/>
gracious with their manners when they are at someone else&#39;s house.<br/>
We have a little friend who is EXACTLY this way.  Mama does everything for<br/>
him, and he comes over and leaves some pretty significant messes and seems<br/>
quite unappreciative, almost rude sometimes.<br/>
So, this freaks me out thinking &quot;i don&#39;t want my children to be this way&quot;.<br/>
I want to believe in what Robyn spoke of, that children will live what is<br/>
being modeled to them, but when I see proof in the opposite, that concerns<br/>
me.<br/>
So. . .?  Any insight here?<br/>

 <br/>
One day when we first started to unschool, I was weeding in the garden. Cameron came <br/>
out and asked whether I wanted him to help. I said that I wanted him to help IF he wanted to help. If he <br/>
didn&#39;t want to help, it wasn&#39;t the kind of help I wanted.<br/>
 <br/>
He was there with me because none of his friends could play just then---they were grounded or doing chores. <br/>
He asked why *he* didn&#39;t have chores. I said that I expected him to help because he *wanted* to, not because<br/>
I could make him. I wanted him to help when he felt ready to. *I* didn&#39;t do things out of martyrdom or <br/>
because I felt I *had* to. I did things because I CHOSE to. As soon as he&#39;d CHOOSE to help, I&#39;d be MORE <br/>
than willing to accpet his help.<br/>
 <br/>
It took a couple of years. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
But he&#39;s SUCH a help now! And joyfully!<br/>
 <br/>
What matters is that they see *you* CHOOSING to do things around the house and *for* them with joy and <br/>
because you want to, because you choose to.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m guessing that child&#39;s mom doesn&#39;t do things so much out of love as out of guilt/responsibility/*have*to.<br/>
That she&#39;s unappreciative of him and rude to him about the messes he makes.<br/>
That makes a BIG difference!<br/>

Are they Unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not being facetious in asking. It really does make a difference because<br/>
Unschooling permeates every part of the relationships between parent and<br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
How does his mother speak to him? What is their relationship like? Is she<br/>
joyful or a martyr about it?<br/>
<br/>
Do your children behave that way when they visit other people&#39;s homes? (Jayn<br/>
is much more polite to other people than to me sometimes.)<br/>

 <br/>

 <br/>
Depends on the reasons you&#39;re doing it and the message they get from you.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t that lead to going to other people&#39;s houses, say, for <br/>
dinner, and just walking away when they&#39;re done eating because, hey, <br/>
putting away dishes and helping clear tables isn&#39;t something *I* do -<br/>
- other people are supposed to do it for me?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
As a guest, I don&#39;t do more than take my dishes to the sink. I personally HATE to have someone in my kitchen (no one loads a dishwasher right! &lt;g&gt;). And I don&#39;t always take my plate to the sink---sometimes the meal is more formal and that (clearing the table) would come across as rude. Depends.<br/>
 <br/>
But both my boys have always taken their plates to the sink. And we ask their guests to do the same. We ask politely (even though most of their friends do not at home), and they do it here. It helps that my boys do it automatically. But they do it because they&#39;ve seen me and Ben do it every night here and offer when we&#39;re guests. Modelling.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 Or wouldn&#39;t it make <br/>
them have no qualms about littering, because, hey, at home, I make <br/>
all kinds of messes and no one complains or expects me to clean it <br/>
up? <br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe. But Cameron was in the car with a friend who threw trash out the window. He was appalled. We&#39;ve always modelled picking up litter, so he does the same.  What I&#39;ve noticed is that people who are forced to clean up refuse to when noone is there to enforce the cleaning up!<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it lead to think of your parents as your personal <br/>
servants and to treat them with a sort of &quot;I snap my fingers and you <br/>
jump&quot; kind of attitude?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=--<br/>
 <br/>
Just the opposite. We&#39;re here to help each other and the earth. Children who are forced to clean up will develop no personal responsibility---they will only clean when they *have* to.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=- <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously the answer to this is not &quot;Yes,&quot; but if someone would <br/>
explain WHY it doesn&#39;t work that way, (because to me it seems like <br/>
it would), I would appreciate it.<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
If we do things because we WANT to, because we CHOOSE to, we do it happily and joyfully---NOT with resentment. No one *makes* you do things today, why do you do them???<br/>

I had a long response when my computer flipped out.<br/>
Basically, it boils down to: <br/>
 <br/>
Why do YOU clean up? Do you do it because you choose to or because you have to? No one&#39;s making you any <br/>
more.  Do you do it joyfully?<br/>
 <br/>
How do you come across to your children? Do you talk with them about it? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Great point!!  No, my children tend to behave very well at others homes.<br/>
Aside from the occasional wanting to jump on the furniture/bed or whatever<br/>
that we do at our home, but usually a friendly reminder is enough.  This<br/>
last question of yours clarifies things for me.  I guess I&#39;m worrying about<br/>
a &#39;non-issue&#39; at this point.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have an experience similar to this?  If so, how do/did you<br/>
handle it?  Do I &#39;go there&#39; with the mother?  Leave it be?  Limit our time<br/>
together?  <br/>
A sticky situation, however, is that my 6yo son wants to hang out with him.<br/>
And when they spend time together, both of my children usually end up<br/>
getting very frustrated, the 6yo usually teary, and the 4yo takes on many of<br/>
said child&#39;s little mannerisms.  What to do, what do do?<br/>
<br/>
Whatcha think?<br/>

when the result for him is usually frustration and tears.  Is it <br/>
because there&#39;s a lack of other friends available to get together <br/>
with?  If that&#39;s the case, I think if I were you I&#39;d focus on forming <br/>
some new friendships that were better fits for my children.<br/>
Sorry if I missed some info that makes my advice moot. :-)<br/>

<br/>
This is a kinda dilemma, but I strongly suggest that you let go of your<br/>
concerns about whether she feels run over (unless she asks you something<br/>
about it). It may just that this boy hasn&#39;t gotten to the place of Empathy<br/>
yet. Or he may turn out to be, in the fullness of time, the first documented<br/>
failure of the Unschooling process in this area...<br/>
<br/>
However I do know how it feels to be around kids (and sometimes parents) who<br/>
make me feel out of whack with the combination of energies.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Does anyone else have an experience similar to this?  If so, how do/did<br/>
you handle it?  Do I &#39;go there&#39; with the mother?  Leave it be?  Limit our<br/>

said child&#39;s little mannerisms.  What to do, what do do? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is sticky....<br/>
<br/>
I have found that limiting contact of someone that Jayn really loves even<br/>
though I don&#39;t, backfires. She just focuses even more on wanting to play<br/>
with the girl. I just work on keeping myself centered and Detached (in the<br/>
Zen way of observing my feelings without acting or making judgments as best<br/>
I can) from feelings or irritation. I don&#39;t want to make it about me, if you<br/>
know what I mean. Either Jayn will come to care about the girl&#39;s character<br/>
defects that are obvious to me, or she won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
There is another child, not a homeschooler (all the kids I see as less than<br/>
ideal amongst Jayn&#39;s play mates are schooled), that we play with regularly.<br/>
It seems that Jayn is often in a state of stress after we leave her,<br/>
although it is not that they have fought or had trouble playing happily. <br/>
<br/>
She will react by creating a conflict with me (eg demands to go to the toy<br/>
store when we are almost home already or some other excessive reaction). She<br/>
needs me to be a stalwart object to push against to get her good cry out.<br/>
What I do is support her need to work through it, even though it is<br/>
sometimes unpleasant. <br/>
<br/>
In fact I had a lot of angst about these demanding outbursts until I<br/>
realized the pattern, and how this was one case when the real need was not<br/>
what was being overtly expressed. After the storm Jayn returns to being her<br/>
sweetest self.<br/>
<br/>
What I have tried to do is expand the number of contacts Jayn has, although<br/>
tbh recently Jayn has been in a hunker down at home phase, and has been<br/>
really reluctant to go to park days, our best source of contact renewal. She<br/>
is also going through an anti-boy phase. <br/>
<br/>
I doubt that there is much you can say to the mother that she might not take<br/>
as a criticism - &quot;Your son is rude and messy&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t ask more of visiting kids than I would ask of Jayn, although there<br/>
are times when I feel that they take advantage of the aura of freedom that<br/>
pervades our home. I also don&#39;t ask less of them in most respects.<br/>
