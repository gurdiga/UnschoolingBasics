<div id="ygrps-yiv-683641691">Hi everyone,<br/>
I&#39;ve posted here a couple of times about my son, and now I need to <br/>
share some things that are happening with my daughter. First I&#39;ll <br/>
supply a little background- we moved to Virginia from New York a year <br/>
ago. We stopped going to school, and we all discovered that we really <br/>
love being home. Our lives changed a LOT with the move and the <br/>
decision to stop going to school. Now we are returning to NY, job <br/>
related reasons, to exactly the place we came from, and my daughter <br/>
has told me she wants to go back to school. She will be entering 8th <br/>
grade. I told her that is her decision and I&#39;ll help her with the <br/>
whole &quot;back to school&quot; thing, but in my secret heart I am really <br/>
unhappy. I want so much for my daughter to stay outside of the school <br/>
system, for a lot of reasons- I don&#39;t need to list them all, but I <br/>
will say that i want my daughter to live and learn and grow outside <br/>
of that institution. The past year, I&#39;ve watched her really and truly <br/>
blossom. She has had bouts of loneliness, because we are pretty <br/>
isolated, but she did meet two girls near her age (13) who were both <br/>
fantastic kids (unschooled for years). She started writing a lot, <br/>
very creative, interesting stories. She started to design her own <br/>
clothing and now has really started to amaze me with her very <br/>
independent and beautiful &quot;style&quot;. She also began to really, in my <br/>
opinion, get to know and love herself. She chose what she wanted to <br/>
do and she did it. She left behind some people and ideas and totally <br/>
started coming into her own.<br/>
Now we are returning and she wants to go back to school. She has a <br/>
friend there (in school) who always seemed to me to overpower my <br/>
daughter. My daughter would do whatever this other girl asked of her, <br/>
and on the several occasions when she did not want to, she was made <br/>
to suffer some weird psychological consequences by either the girl or <br/>
her family. The whole family was quite overbearing- for example, if <br/>
my daughter chose not to attend a sleepover at the girl&#39;s house, the <br/>
mom would email my daughter, using her daughter&#39;s account, and tell <br/>
my daughter how hurt and saddened she and her daughter were by my <br/>
daughter&#39;s decision. This kind of stuff happened every time my <br/>
daughter would choose not to do whatever the other girl wanted. I <br/>
would talk with her about it and try to reassure her that she was <br/>
allowed to make her own decisions, but she always caved in to the <br/>
other family and did what they wanted. I was even then trying to let <br/>
my daughter choose for herself but now I wonder if I was setting a <br/>
precedent that I&#39;d let other people boss her around.<br/>
So I&#39;m worried for my newly independent girl. Not only will she be <br/>
going back to prison, I mean, school, but she will also be going back <br/>
to this friend who she always caved in to. I haven&#39;t said much except <br/>
axpressed how excited I have been to see my daughter doing her own <br/>
thing. I haven&#39;t said &quot;PLEASE, don&#39;t give in!!!&quot; but my heart is in <br/>
my throat at the very thought of her going back.<br/>
I also told her that it is her choice to return to school and it is <br/>
her choice to stay. She can leave at any time. I want her to see <br/>
school as something she is choosing to do. <br/>
Any words of wisdom? I&#39;m really feeling like my daughter&#39;s future is <br/>
hanging in the balance here. I know that&#39;s black and white thinking, <br/>
but it feels real. It&#39;s like, we just started this journey!! I&#39;m <br/>
afraid we&#39;ll miss so much now that she&#39;s going to go back to school.<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342652559">You know, you may not be giving her enough credit.<br/>
<br/>
She may be a lot stronger than you think. She&#39;s grown a lot the past <br/>
year. Maybe she&#39;s more prepared and more sure of herself. Maybe she can <br/>
handle more than you think she can?<br/>
<br/>
She may decide that school really isn&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be and <br/>
that the friend isn&#39;t all that much fun---and kind of bossy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think I would quit worrying so much and step back and see what <br/>
happens.<br/>
<br/>
Trust her. I bet she&#39;ll be fine.<br/>
