I hope you don&#39;t mind me picking a bit, but this phrase really <br/>
jumped out at me and I can&#39;t let it go:<br/>
&quot;Last night as we<br/>
prepared thanksgiving dinner and all the adults were busy, she wanted<br/>
someone to play with her. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is it normal for the adults to &quot;get busy&quot; with their stuff and <br/>
exclude her? Why couldn&#39;t she help with the Thanksgiving dinner? I <br/>
know it can be hard to have an extra person underfoot, but I don&#39;t <br/>
think there are many things more disrespectful or frustrating for <br/>
children, than being told &quot;we have to do x,y,z, you need to go play&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Children want to feel like they are welcome to do all the same <br/>
activities the adults in their lives are doing. If she&#39;s feeling <br/>
rejection on any level, then I&#39;m quite sure that would account for <br/>
some of her behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking about this from her point of view. Mommy is not as fun <br/>
as she usually is, being large (this baby is already intruding into <br/>
her life) and tired. The adults are sending her off to do something <br/>
else, she&#39;d probably like to feel important and involved. Then when <br/>
she acts out, everyone is looking at her with &quot;that look&quot; or being <br/>
upset and mad at her, poor dear is utterly confused, angry and <br/>
feeling rejected. I&#39;d throw some fits too!!!:)<br/>

Maybe she needs to feel more welcome in the adult activities? If  <br/>
family is the problem, stand up for her right to be involved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-216598788">Hi Ren,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind you picking a bit! I value your opinion.<br/>
<br/>
And you are absolutely right. This was the first family dinner we have had<br/>
here since last Christmas. I didn&#39;t know she was going to be feeling<br/>
different about it than last year (she didn&#39;t care to help then) and she<br/>
wasn&#39;t able to articulate it this weekend. BUT eventually, I heard her<br/>
saying she wanted to do something and so I found her something to do and she<br/>
was so happy to be helping out taking food to the table etc. and the entire<br/>
atmosphere changed. And I said to my dh that she was needing to feel<br/>
included. So simple and yet sometimes it just takes so long to get it!<br/>
<br/>
And then at dinner, she went around the table and asked everyone what they<br/>
were thankful for, without anyone prompting her to, just her idea. It was so<br/>
sweet.<br/>
<br/>
You are right I have to include her in things more. Sometimes when I try she<br/>
says no and then I tend to forget or don&#39;t bother next time, but I can&#39;t do<br/>
that. Also I have a hard time figuring out things that she can do that will<br/>
set her up for success sometimes that won&#39;t result in cranberries on the<br/>
beige carpet, but I will work on it.<br/>
<br/>
We have never not included her, I remember my dh having her help make salad<br/>
at a year and a half, I think the thing that has changed is she asks us to<br/>
leave our task to play with her and doesn&#39;t ask to be included in ours<br/>
anymore... so we just need to adjust to that I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for bringing this up,<br/>

My DS (now 5) really loves to help me cook/bake.  He doesn&#39;t stay with <br/>
me the whole time - and I don&#39;t expect him to - but he&#39;ll help set up <br/>
ingredients or grab something from the fridge for me.  Mostly, he likes <br/>
to *add* the ingredients to the bowl/pot and then go watch some more TV <br/>
or whatever else he&#39;s playing with.  If I&#39;m making soup he wants to <br/>
scoop the chopped veggies off the cutting board into the pot.  Pour <br/>
rice into the pot.  Help stir things into soups or stews.  Add the <br/>
sifted flour to the mixing bowl.  Dump in the chocolate chips.  You get <br/>
the idea.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Last Thanksgiving he helped me make homemade cranberry sauce (my first <br/>
not from a can!) and he totally dug it.  He even ate some of it because <br/>
HE made it.  It was so simple to make and really yummy.  He&#39;s been <br/>
asking me to make it again but I haven&#39;t been able to find fresh <br/>
cranberries here (much less organic ones! LOL).  When we see them in <br/>
stores again soon we&#39;ll be making it again and definitely for <br/>
Thanksgiving and Yule dinners.  He&#39;s so proud of himself for being able <br/>
to cook it himself and he really *glows* when I make sure to tell DH <br/>
that he helped to make _____ for our meal.  It&#39;s great to be able to <br/>
provide the opportunities for him to be able to Shine!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241610648">Hi Tracy,<br/>
<br/>
OK... please don&#39;t take this the wrong way ok?<br/>
<br/>
I hear what you are saying. Hannah helps me make food all the time, from<br/>
dinner, to salads to baking together. She is good at it. She is also very<br/>
scattered in her concentration. She is more worried that I am WATCHING her<br/>
to see her do it than if she is doing it well.<br/>
<br/>
In this case we were eating in our dining room. We had a drop cloth down on<br/>
the floor around her chair, no problems with spills. <br/>
<br/>
What I was referring to was, she was carrying the serving bowl of<br/>
cranberries from the kitchen to the dining room. I would need a 20 foot<br/>
sheet of plastic to cover that amount of carpet. It was the entire amount of<br/>
cranberries we had to eat, if it fell everyone would miss out on it for<br/>
dinner and everyone (including Hannah) loves to eat cranberries. Plus, this<br/>
is not just my carpet or Hannah&#39;s, it is her dad&#39;s as well and he pays to<br/>
have it cleaned and gets way more bothered by spills than I do.<br/>
<br/>
So I let her carry things that wouldn&#39;t make a big mess and still through it<br/>
all, she was not watching the bowl to make sure it spilled, or where she was<br/>
going, she was watching us,  to make sure each and everyone of us had<br/>
stopped what we were doing to watch her carrying it. At least twice if I<br/>
hadn&#39;t reached for the bowl and straightened it (because she was watching us<br/>
not the bowl) it would have spilled all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
She is very distracted when doing these kinds of things and so I struggle to<br/>
find things that will set her up for success, since I KNOW if she dropped<br/>
it, she would be crying and sad for hours that she didn&#39;t do it right.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway that is all I had to think about on this... as for the cranberries,<br/>
you can get very good frozen organic cranberries to make the cranberries<br/>
with in the freezer section, that is what we use all the time:)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts,<br/>

hadn&#39;t reached for the bowl and straightened it (because she was watching us<br/>
not the bowl) it would have spilled all over the place.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I want to suggest that a plastic Tupperware type of serving bowl with a<br/>
cover would enable her to carry spillable things and still allow you to be<br/>
aware of her competence level. Jayn is the same about sometimes not watching<br/>
what she is carrying (although she doesn&#39;t watch me in the way you mention),<br/>
but I would never hurt her feelings by not letting her help or reaching out.<br/>
I do say, &quot;the cup is tilting&quot; when necessary. Thank goodness we are renting<br/>
an apartment the carpet of which is already at the bitter end of it&#39;s useful<br/>
life anyway. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;She is very distracted when doing these kinds of things and so I<br/>
struggle to find things that will set her up for success, since I KNOW if<br/>
she dropped it, she would be crying and sad for hours that she didn&#39;t do it<br/>
right.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Poor little sausage! I have to wonder, in the light of what you have posted<br/>
about your dh, if he is not partly of the cause of this reaction. Jayn is<br/>
*so* proud of herself when she gets to do something for her father in<br/>
particular, much more than for merely me! There is some hero worship there<br/>
at times, ambivalence at other times. Maybe if your dh is more vocally<br/>
concerned as you say, it could be impacting her self esteem, or worse<br/>
contributing to perfectionism. I always feel sad for the little child that<br/>
was when I hear stories about Martha Stewart&#39;s father (an extreme example of<br/>
a perfectionist critical papa from what I hear) and grateful for my<br/>
easygoing tolerant dh.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Anyway that is all I had to think about on this... as for the<br/>
cranberries, you can get very good frozen organic cranberries to make the<br/>
cranberries with in the freezer section, that is what we use all the<br/>
time:)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really like the dried cranberries as snacks & on cereal, substituting for<br/>
raisins.<br/>
