I&#39;m fortunate to live in Pensacola near Ren, who :-(<br/>
will be moving. Anyway, she has been a wonderful<br/>
inspiration to me in not just unschooling but with<br/>
another area that is very emotional for me. She<br/>
accepted me with open and loving arms and has been the<br/>
single most factor in my decision to unschool. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aaaaw....thanks Sandy. I am honored and humbled by your post.:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I could be here to let you know it&#39;s all good on the other<br/>
side!  <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list, I think you&#39;ll find it a valuable resource and<br/>
font of inspiration. There are some incredible voices here...they<br/>
inspire me daily.<br/>
