<div id="ygrps-yiv-820551378">If you have a Barnes and Noble Booksellers near you this week is &quot;Educator&#39;s<br/>
Appreciation Week&quot; and they include homeschoolers in that category.  You<br/>
have to sign up for a card, but it is painless.  They asked if I had an<br/>
&quot;association&quot; so I just told them I was with Pensacola Unschoolers and they<br/>
didn&#39;t even ask for any &quot;proof&quot;  I signed up for this program when we lived<br/>
in Alabama and needed something to &quot;prove&quot; I was a homeschooler.  Fortunatly<br/>
our cover school sent everyone &quot;educator cards.&quot;  But you could make<br/>
something up on your computer.  You can get 20% off on anything you use in<br/>
your &quot;classroom&quot; except magazines, newspapers, music and movies (which I<br/>
think is fairly limiting).  This week you save 25% off on all books<br/>
including &quot;personal items&quot; and 10% off on movies and music.  It&#39;s a lot of<br/>
fun to be able to say yes to a bunch of books and such.<br/>
<br/>
Thought I would pass this on.  Emily purchased several manga books, Mary<br/>
Elayne wanted 3 new installments of Magic Treehouse, and Keon picked up a<br/>
book on the middle ages (particularly focusing on weapons, knights and<br/>
horses.)  We will probably go back again this week since Mary Elayne has<br/>
already finished 1.5 of the books we got just a few hours ago.  Speaking of<br/>
which, does anyone have any ideas of similar books to the Magic Treehouse<br/>
books that might be a little more in depth?  Mary Elayne loves the<br/>
characters in these books and likes the premise (two kids get whisked away<br/>
to some adventure (usually historical in nature) and find out cool things<br/>
about that place or time) but she is wanting something with more substance<br/>
and involvement.  She can&#39;t stand the American Girl series and enjoys<br/>
mysteries.  She&#39;s your typical 10.5yo velvet goth with purply-black hair and<br/>
a desire to own a zombie.  (if there is such a thing as a typical<br/>
10.5yovelvet goth with purply-black hair and a desire to own a<br/>
zombie.)  I&#39;m sure<br/>
she is what Lydia was from Beetlejuice when she was 10.5yo.  :)<br/>

able to show the letter I receive after registering with my county, <br/>
though different stores have been more and less &quot;easy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I like about Borders, which has the same percentages, is <br/>
that I&#39;m able to cash in my Discover Card Cashback bonus awards for <br/>
Borders gift certificates, making it 25% off already &quot;free&quot; books!<br/>
<br/>
The key, of course, to getting free books is to be sure to pay the <br/>
credit card balance to zero each month to avoid getting slapped with <br/>
finance charges. Doing that, however, we use our Discover card for <br/>
*everything* from groceries to gas to incidentals, which racks up the <br/>
points pretty quickly. I generally cash them in twice a year, donate a <br/>
bit of it to the Make a Wish Foundation, which is one of their partners, <br/>
and get the rest in Borders gift certificates. Loads of fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-783816171">Hey Michelle, I don&#39;t know if your daughter would like these since <br/>
they are kind of similiar to American Girl, but not exactly. It <br/>
wouldn&#39;t hurt to look at the Sisters in Time series, Dear America <br/>
series or My Name is America series. The only downfall to these books <br/>
are that they are mostly taking place in American history, not much <br/>
about any of the rest of the world. But they are very interesting! I <br/>
actually like to read the Sisters in Time myself! Anyway, if I can <br/>
come up with anything else, I&#39;ll let you know!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129428593">Hey Michelle, I also ran across some neat little books at BAM <br/>
called &quot;Time Soldiers&quot; (you can probably find them at the library too). <br/>
They are... different, but pretty cool looking. Maybe your daughter <br/>
could have a look at those and she if she&#39;d like them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d love to know your definition of &quot;different&quot;  :)  I did thumb through one<br/>
of Mary&#39;s Treehouse books and saw that Mary Pope does write for older ages.<br/>
Mary  Elayne is just about to the hardback books and I will not buy new<br/>
hardback books at $10 each which she will read in 2 hours!  It&#39;s just not in<br/>
the finances.  I pointed that out to her and she said she would look at them<br/>
when we go to the bookstore this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of these books, Keon asked if he could have the medieval &quot;study<br/>
guide&quot; that goes with one of the books.  For each of these books the author<br/>
has put out another book with more details about the subject. We sat reading<br/>
it together on my bed the other day and I was horrified at how inaccurate<br/>
most of the information was!  Maybe it is the 25 years of studying medieval<br/>
history, but most of the information I found to be inaccurate at best!<br/>
Almost like she had made it all up or talked to people who gave suppositions<br/>
on what they thought the middle ages was all about!  Which makes me question<br/>
her other books in this series as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We thought the same thing! Qacei was really mad when they started putting Magic Treehouse in hardcover instead of the cheap and easy paperbacks. She even wrote a letter to Mary Pope Osborne. She was incredibly disappointed to get only a form letter back. :-(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135350355">My oldest dd (10) has just discovered the Young Indiana Jones books.  <br/>
Of course he doesn&#39;t actually travel back in time, but she is enjoying <br/>
them as much as she does the Magic Tree House.  I am not sure when <br/>
they were written, but I did find some at the library.  <br/>
