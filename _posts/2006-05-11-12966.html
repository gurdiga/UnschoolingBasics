<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972804427">&quot;I Could  Do Anything If I Only Knew What It Was&quot; by Barbara Sher has <br/>
step by step  exercises to figure out what you might enjoy and how to <br/>
use baby steps to  actually TRY new things.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a great read.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you  have fun exploring all kinds of new things now that all 3 <br/>
are out of  school! I can only imagine how weird that must feel at this  <br/>
point.<br/>

*************************<br/>
Barbara has a new book out, Refuse to Choose! A Revolutionary Program for  <br/>
Doing Everything That You Love. I haven&#39;t read all of it, but so far it feels  <br/>
like an Unschooler&#39;s Bible.  She describes what she calls Scanners --  people <br/>
who have many interests and passions.<br/>
 <br/>
I think Barbara has a handle on adult unschoolers who weren&#39;t raised  <br/>
unschoolers. One of the things I love about her is her emphasis on your NOT  having <br/>
to become &quot;a better person&quot; before you can have your dreams.<br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;s very cool.<br/>

Got mine at Amazon. It&#39;s AMAZING! I think Barbara&#39;s books are great for  <br/>
unschoolers...it reminds us grownups that we get to have wonderful lives  too.<br/>
