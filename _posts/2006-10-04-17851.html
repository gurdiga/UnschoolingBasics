privately is the way to go, or emphasizing the correct pronounciation, <br/>
ie: &quot;yes, I do see that Rabbit!&quot; I love the fact that he has never <br/>
been labeled, or made to feel as if there was something wrong with <br/>
him. That was my fear in bringing it up to the Dr. or having speech <br/>
therapy. I think we&#39;ll just continue to live, learn and love. But <br/>
again- thank you. It was so reassuring for me to hear other opinions <br/>
from the unschooling community. Most of my public schooling friends <br/>
have said- &quot;make sure he gets therapy, the sooner the better!&quot; ugh!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As others have probably said, I might consider therapy if there was <br/>
something that was making it frustratingly hard for my DS to <br/>
communicate what he wanted to communicate and I couldn&#39;t find any way <br/>
to readily assist (like the simple &#39;bite your tongue&#39; reminder) or <br/>
didn&#39;t know how to assist -and- it seemed like it was not gradually <br/>
clearing up (not on a timetable but making progress toward clarity in <br/>
communicating). Then, I&#39;d probably go *myself* and discuss the <br/>
situation with someone and see what they said. For some things, time <br/>
is really the only thing that will do anything (with or without <br/>
therapy) while other things do need some sort of assistance. I&#39;d then <br/>
maybe schedule a very short course of visits to see how the therapist <br/>
approaches/helps, what exercises, and so on - stuff that we could do <br/>
at home. Then, that&#39;d be the end of the therapist most likely and we&#39;d <br/>
just work on it on our own, at our own pace.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t even go that far.  It&#39;s almost as if you are saying, &quot;No,<br/>
it is pronounced Rabbit, not Wabbit.&quot;  I would just talk normall<br/>
through the day.  If you have a natural pattern in your speech to say<br/>
the word rabbit say it without emphasis.  I took (as part of my<br/>
theatre training) many speech classes.  We had one class just on the<br/>
correct pronunciation of words.  (You wouldn&#39;t believe the number of<br/>
words people mispronounce!)  Anyway, the teacher was really annoying<br/>
because anytime you would talk to her (whether you were in class or<br/>
not or even in one of her classes) she would correct your speech and<br/>
grammar.  She would say, &quot;It&#39;s &#39;off-en&#39; not &#39;off-ten&#39;&quot; all the time.<br/>
Truly annoying and I&#39;m sure it made the person that she was speaking<br/>
to (sometimes even other professors) irritated and embarassed.  I&#39;m<br/>
sure she thought she was being helpful, but it was mostly annoying.<br/>

 <br/>
My son really would benefit and has benefitted from speech therapy.   Our <br/>
trouble has been &quot;the System&quot; and continues to be.....his therapist called  my <br/>
pediatrician behind our backs and told him my son was severely  retarded.  She <br/>
potentially has done some other things that have resulted in  problems for us.<br/>
 <br/>
His therapy came to end because I refuse to go through the school  system and <br/>
have him retested and monitored by psychologists, just so our  insurance will <br/>
pay for private therapy.  And now I won&#39;t go back  anyway.  My son enjoyed it <br/>
for awhile and got some confidence back, but  then he got tired of her <br/>
quizzing him on educational matters (she was giving him  math quizzes and was upset <br/>
that he didn&#39;t know really important things like his  birthday).<br/>
 <br/>
So, if someone is considering therapy of any kind, my advise would be to be  <br/>
careful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691209252">My older brothers both went to speech therapy back in the old days when tape recorders were new on the market.  The oldest lost his speech &#39;impediment&#39;, as they called it, right away.  The younger of the two, still has his.  In PA, they thought he sounded &quot;dumb&quot;.  When we moved to FL, the girls swarmed to him for his &quot;foreign accent&quot;  (ex: girls sounds like gills)  He is a very accomplished architect with a great career at age 45.  <br/>
