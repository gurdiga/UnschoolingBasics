<div id="ygrps-yiv-391181046">What do you guys think of this?  A friend, who is I think has not been unschooling for too long, is concerned about her son watching tv when bored.  She feels he&#39;s biding his time until kids in the neighborhood come home from school.  Then, he goes and plays with them.  She has twin babies and I know it&#39;s difficult for her to get out more than a couple times a week because of the babies&#39; nap times.  My suggestion was more playdates (could someone come pick her son up or have the playdate at her house?), strewing more, and talking with her son about boredom and what he needs.  I also said to trust him, that he&#39;s getting something out of everything he&#39;s doing.  Sounded good to her, just wondering what others might add.  Oh, and they&#39;re going on vacation soon and she&#39;s concerned that he&#39;ll just watch tv and play video games, as he did in the past.  If memory serves, she said he&#39;s just now gotten some more freedom so it&#39;s probably similar to what&#39;s happening to the mom with the kid who suddenly got the freedom with the video games.<br/>
