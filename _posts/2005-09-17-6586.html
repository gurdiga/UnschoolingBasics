<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265265620">I&#39;ve been having this burning desire to do writing prompts recently  <br/>
so I started a list for kids *and* adults. I&#39;ll post a weekly prompt  <br/>
and people can post their writings to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Just send an email to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingWriters-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingWriters-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s the list description:<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
A list for anyone who likes to write. All ages welcome. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I will post weekly writing prompts. You don&#39;t need to be an  <br/>
unschooler to join in but the flavor of the list will be creative  <br/>
rather than formal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found many writing prompts tend to favor contemporary settings,  <br/>
writing about present day average people. My personal bent is towards  <br/>
fantasy, science fiction, historical mysteries and recently manga  <br/>
(Japanese comics.) Everyone is encouraged to take the writing prompts  <br/>
in any direction they wish.<br/>
<br/>
Please do comment on other&#39;s writing. Tell them what you liked. If  <br/>
something is unclear, ask! Avoid criticism such as &quot;That really stinks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Most important is having fun :-)<br/>
<br/>

PS: All new members will be moderated until your first post so I can  <br/>
catch spam before it reaches the list. So if your first post doesn&#39;t  <br/>
show up right away, it&#39;s probably because I only check the pending  <br/>
messages once a day. Don&#39;t worry. It will show up! :-)<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
The first writing prompt is:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Until ____, nothing had ever happened in the village of Fool&#39;s Knock.<br/>
