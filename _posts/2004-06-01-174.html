<div>I went out of town for a few days----and the list popped up to 106!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I SOOO wanted to enjoy that 100 milestone, but y&#39;all were so fast that I 
missed it!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But I figured I&#39;d just let y&#39;all know that we&#39;ve passed the 100 mark!</div>

<div>I was very disappointed in the dissolution of the many&nbsp;unschooling 
lists these past two years. They were my life-line when I first started out and 
then as I&nbsp;continued to unschool and help others &quot;get&quot; it. It pains me that 
they are gone, but I&#39;m glad Ren and I were able to start this one.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I appreciate that so many of you followed us over here. I hope we don&#39;t 
disappoint you!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks for the support---and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all here!</div>

I don&#39;t post much but read all the time on the unschooling lists and it was weird watching all the lists &quot;rearranging&quot; this past few days.&nbsp; I just kept reading until I found where Kelly and Ren were writing!&nbsp; Love both your styles and attitudes.&nbsp; I&#39;m feeling very &quot;at home&quot; with unschooling these days.&nbsp; After almost a year, I am an unschooler heart and soul and realize that I will never go back. Our lives are so full and joyful and fun!&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Sandra wrote recently on the UnschoolingDiscussions list about comparing unschooling and riding a bike and I loved her analogy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unschooling truly is like bike riding.&nbsp; You will never again be able to &quot;not&quot; ride a bike and you will never again &quot;not&quot; be an unschooler once you truly live it.<br>
<br>
Thanks Kelly and Ren for the new list and for the time and thoughtful responses you put into your writing. <br>
