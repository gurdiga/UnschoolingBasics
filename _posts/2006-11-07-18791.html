<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084773509">Hi,<br/>
I was hoping someone could share with me their thoughts on this and <br/>
maybe some advice. <br/>
<br/>
Last night after my family had all gone to bed and only our youngest, <br/>
age 17 months and I were awake, I was startled by a loud knock at the <br/>
door. My other 3 children had been sleeping for over an hour at this <br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
The knock woke my husband and he answered the door. I was in the <br/>
kitchen nursing the youngest. It was a police officer telling us he <br/>
received a call about a domestic disturbance. <br/>
<br/>
To say we were surprised and shocked was a understatement. The <br/>
officer talked to my husband a bit and then asked to see me to be <br/>
sure everything was alright. After talking with me and seeing that <br/>
everything was ok he left.<br/>
<br/>
Today, my husband mentioned to me that a friend he told about the <br/>
incident warned him that even if their wasn&#39;t a problem that often <br/>
children and family services will pay a visit after something like <br/>
this. He suggested we be on our guard. <br/>
<br/>
We are a good family with good kids and we can&#39;t understand this. <br/>
What makes this worse is the fact that for a year now I have been <br/>
receiving letters in the mail telling me my husband has been cheating <br/>
on me, etc. (He&#39;s not trust me, I even have proof.)  We had to change <br/>
our phone number because of phone calls and even my internet address <br/>
because they would send e-mails there.  <br/>
<br/>
In addition to this my next door neighbor keeps complaining about the <br/>
noise level of our children. She complains about the yelling, loud <br/>
talking, etc that she hears over here. <br/>
<br/>
My children, although basically good kids, are very rowdy by nature. <br/>
They play and talk very loudly and often yell during their games. <br/>
I&#39;ve suggested to them to tone it down, but that hasn&#39;t had any <br/>
effect. ( They are 10 yr, 8 yr, 3 yr and 17 months old)The noise <br/>
doesn&#39;t bother my husband and I, but we don&#39;t want any troble.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are now worried and concerned. We don&#39;t want <br/>
anything to happen to us or the children. We also worry because have <br/>
just started unschooling in February this year. If the authorities do <br/>
get called on us will we be in trouble? <br/>
<br/>
We are unschooling under an umbrella school in Florida that only <br/>
requires attendance. Although my children are involved in a lot of <br/>
things, read frequently and do educational things on the computer I <br/>
have no evidence of what they&#39;ve done and learned during this time. <br/>
(which is tons) Could that be used against us? I did write stuff down <br/>
in a notebook but it was accidentally destroyed so I no longer have <br/>
it. ( I have since learned to keep this kind of thing on the <br/>
computer) How will I explain what we did from Feb to Oct? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d appreciate any thoughts, advice or comments and will be thankful <br/>
to anyone who replies. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope everyone has a <br/>
good day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-167678531">Hi Maggie, <br/>
<br/>
I am also in Florida and I think we&#39;re using the same 600 school as <br/>
you. (Is it AEI?) If it is, she has a form letter you can print out <br/>
with all the legal mumbo jumbo on it, like her DOE # and a bit about <br/>
the school. It may be all you need to satisfy someone&#39;s questioning. <br/>
<br/>
My advice is to sound secure in what you&#39;re doing and remember, <br/>
unless they have a search warrant, they cannot come in your house. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!!<br/>
Joanne<br/>

Have you saved any of the harassing letters or email you received? You might want to compile a chronology of the harrassment and report it. Also, if the responding officer was required to complete a report after visiting your house, you may be able to get it. It would not have the reporting party&#39;s information, but the officer may have put down verbiage in there that would give you more information such as &quot;responding to reports of a woman screaming&quot; or &quot;responding to  reports of a child crying&quot; at such and such an address. If he filed no report you are out of luck on that score, but you may be able to get information from the dispath center. They cannot tell you who the reporting party was, but they may give you the verbiage used by the caller, which could alert you as to where it came from, such as the neighbor. I worked as a police dispatcher and there was information we were allowed to give the public, such as time the call was placed, who the responding officer was, whether a <br/>
report was filed, time of dispatch and arrival, etc. Keep a record of this stuff, I would. But dont be too paranoid about the unschooling. You are doing nothing illegal. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909280974">this is my first post  :)<br/>
<br/>
i think you did absolutely the right thing letting the<br/>
officer speak with both of you. he probably doesn&#39;t<br/>
feel there is any reason to follow-up.<br/>
<br/>
it seems like a good idea to be cooperative with<br/>
officials. police warrants are only issued to search<br/>
your home for evidence of wrongdoing in a criminal<br/>
matter, so you are probably safe there.<br/>
<br/>
however, if the police officer finds more reason to<br/>
believe your family should be investigated for any<br/>
supposed wrongdoing, and DHS becomes involved, then it<br/>
gets sticky. i would think the best course of action<br/>
would be full cooperation on your part. that is an<br/>
organization you do not want to provoke. in some<br/>
states they can get nasty and actually remove your<br/>
children temporarily from your care over the slightest<br/>
thing (such as lack of parental cooperation which may<br/>
seem &quot;suspicious&quot; to them), and then worry about the<br/>
&quot;paperwork&quot; later.<br/>
<br/>
dh was a police officer for 10 years and saw many<br/>
different situations. he agrees the best course of<br/>
action is to document everything yourself and see an<br/>
attorney if the harassment continues.<br/>
<br/>
does the nosy neighbor disapprove of homeschooling? if<br/>
so, maybe a friendly educational chat will soften her<br/>
attitude.  :) <br/>
<br/>
is it possible the person who accused your dh of<br/>
cheating made the call to the police to harass you<br/>
even further? knowing who made the complaint will help<br/>
decide your course of action.<br/>
<br/>
i agree with the lister who said not to worry about<br/>
the homeschooling. try to relax. let them see your<br/>
confidence in the learning lifestyle you have chosen<br/>
for your family. unless your children are being abused<br/>
or neglected you have nothing to stress over.<br/>
<br/>
my 2 cents,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999203713">I think you should file a police report.  Reporting that your family has been harassed for over a year now: the mails, phone calls and emails as well as last nights police visit while your children were asleep.  You should request an investigation and find out that who is behind all these and trying to hurt your family.  The police should know who made that phone call last night. <br/>
   <br/>
  In the mean time, please make every effort to keep your children safe.  Looks like there maybe a very bitter person around you who doesnt like to see your children happy and your family prosper. <br/>

After a false alarm?<br/>
<br/>
Two summers ago I was surprised by a policeman coming in my back door.  It <br/>
was a Saturday morning.  David (dh) was at a garage sale, Dylan (ds) was <br/>
upstairs asleep, I was at the computer.  The front door and back door were <br/>
open.   A cop pulled up in front of my house (I didn&#39;t see him and if I <br/>
heard him I attributed it to neighbors or traffic noise.)  He walked past my <br/>
open front door, around the side of my house, through my back gate and to my <br/>
back door.  I got up to fill my coffee cup.  Imagine my surprise to find a <br/>
big guy with a gun in my kitchen!<br/>
<br/>
He said there&#39;d been a report of gunshots.<br/>
<br/>
I assured him no one was shooting.  He said he needed to check the house and <br/>
I said &quot;no you don&#39;t.&quot;  He said it was procedure to check the house after a <br/>
call like that.    I said, &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He left.   Then all my neighbors wanted to know why there&#39;d been a cop at my <br/>
house.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cops get calls that turn out to be nothing.<br/>

and goes out on quite a few domestic disturbance calls at all hours of<br/>
the night).  He said that many times people will hear a scream or a<br/>
yell or a crash and attribute it to the wrong house.  He said twice he<br/>
has been called out on a &quot;domestic disturbance&quot; that was just hot and<br/>
heavy (and very vocal) sex.  He was concerned about your threatening<br/>
e-mails and phone calls and asked if you had filed a complaint about<br/>
those.  He said it is very important to take those things seriously<br/>
because the police can do something about them, espcially if they are<br/>
escalating (and it seems that they are).  With that kind of<br/>
information the police have the right to go back and see who placed<br/>
the call from last night to see if it was legitimate.  They could find<br/>
that the person who placed the call did so from all the way across<br/>
town!<br/>
<br/>
As far as unschooling in Florida, you are doing nothing illegal.  You<br/>
should have something from your 600 school stating that you are<br/>
enrolled with them and you can always get something from them that you<br/>
are in &quot;good standing.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052264979">&quot;it seems like a good idea to be cooperative with<br/>
officials.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cooperative is one thing, ignoring your basic rights  as a US citizen<br/>
is another, and exactly what makes those organizations think they have<br/>
more power than they legally have!<br/>
You do NOT ever need to let anyone in your home without a search<br/>
warrant. Ever.<br/>
<br/>
We had a school social worker come to our home because someone<br/>
reported our children weren&#39;t in school. I dealt with everything over<br/>
the phone, they never even came to my house after the initial visit<br/>
(we weren&#39;t home when they first came by).<br/>
<br/>
I know someone that spoke with DHS on their porch and did not let them<br/>
in the home. That is FINE. There is no reason to live in fear of these<br/>
people, that&#39;s what gives them more &quot;rights&quot; than the common man.<br/>
Watch &quot;V is for Vendetta&quot; if you need a dose of confidence.<br/>
<br/>
Seems everyone is living in fear of their government these days.<br/>
DOesn&#39;t take very many generations to forget our treasonous roots,<br/>
does it? ARgh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205758788">based on reading the past posts in this new group i<br/>
joined, i knew my response might provoke strong<br/>
feelings in one or two of the other listers.  *grin*<br/>
which is exactly why i haven&#39;t posted before.<br/>
<br/>
but i felt strongly enough about this to go ahead and<br/>
caution the original poster. basic rights are<br/>
generally a reality in this great country, but the<br/>
truth is that they become an &quot;ideal&quot; in certain<br/>
situations. i would never speak so strongly about<br/>
something of which i had no direct experience with.<br/>
although this is not something i agree with, it is<br/>
something which i know can be very real. <br/>
<br/>
lack of cooperation with DHS can only harm the kids in<br/>
the long run. i am talking using poorly thought out<br/>
language or even losing your temper. inflaming a DHS<br/>
official can result in loss of the kids, even<br/>
temporarily. no one likes the thought of their kids<br/>
spending even one night in a foster home (if there is<br/>
one available...otherwise they could end up in a<br/>
halfway house or in a public building). <br/>
<br/>
i do not mean to suggest that anyone let anyone come<br/>
into their home! my suggestion is to use caution and<br/>
common sense when dealing with DHS, for unfortunately<br/>
they do have the power to make your life very<br/>
inconvenient. in some places, they don&#39;t need any kind<br/>
of paperwork to remove your children from your home on<br/>
the spot. they only need &quot;reasonable cause&quot; to<br/>
question the safety of the children. my husband has<br/>
done it before.<br/>
<br/>
based on the original info i would guess it won&#39;t come<br/>
to this, as there seems to be no wrongdoing on the<br/>
part of the original poster. i definitely don&#39;t mean<br/>
to make anyone feel fearful of their local government,<br/>
or anything ridiculous like that. i was only intending<br/>
to communicate the wisdom of cooperation (within<br/>
reason).<br/>

&gt; Cooperative is one thing, ignoring your basic rights<br/>
&gt;  as a US citizen<br/>
&gt; is another, and exactly what makes those<br/>
&gt; organizations think they have<br/>
&gt; more power than they legally have!<br/>
&gt; You do NOT ever need to let anyone in your home<br/>
&gt; without a search<br/>
&gt; warrant. Ever.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is scare tactic that DHS/HRS/(Insert your local children&#39;s<br/>
service initials here) wants you to think.  They like that fear, but<br/>
unless they have just reason they have NO reason to enter your home<br/>
without a warrant and a warrant must be presented not by the DHS agent<br/>
but by a law enforcement officer.  Most DHS agents are very familiar<br/>
with homeschoolers.  They get calls often about &quot;kids not in school&quot;<br/>
and they usually ask first if the children are homeschooled.  If the<br/>
caller doesn&#39;t the agent will check into it.  Noisy, rowdy, active,<br/>
homeschooled children are not enough for a judge to issue a warrant.<br/>
There needs to be evidence of *neglect* or *abuse* not just kids being<br/>
kids.  The courts are already backed up with domestic abuse cases,<br/>
neglect cases and true truancy that they aren&#39;t going to go looking<br/>
for more trouble.<br/>
<br/>
This is why it is important for the OP to have a police file<br/>
documenting all the e-mails and phone calls and the action that they<br/>
have had to take from this obvious stalker.  This will be the first<br/>
place that DHS looks.  What do we have on record about these people?<br/>
&quot;Oh, look, these people are obviously being harassed by someone.  Now<br/>
I see where this is coming from.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is no reason to get violent and aggressive about your rights.<br/>
Just firm and redundant.  Repeat the law ad naseum if you must.  &quot;I<br/>
know you have recieved a complaint but unless you have a warrant I do<br/>
not have to let you into my home.  I will be happy to answer any of<br/>
your questions either via phone or here on my front porch.&quot;<br/>

DHS in her home either today LOL!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-568368532">I used to do Foster Care, and most case workers will tell you that most cases are proven false.  One case worker told that most of her referrals were feuding neighbors turning each other in, and divorced parents turning each in.  And yes, it&#39;s obvious you have some extremely disturbed individual that is stalking you.  Save everything, so you can start making your case to the police.  <br/>
