more convinced than I am even. That&#39;s good since he&#39;s the at home <br/>
parent. There already is a yahoo group for dads UnschoolingDads - no <br/>
moms allowed!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159292518">Ben&#39;s on both the SSUDs and the UnschoolingDads lists, but our computers are D-E-A-D, and we have limited access right now. <br/>
 <br/>
Ben will be speaking and hosting Dads&#39; get-togethers at both the New England Unschooling Conference in Peabody, MA in May and the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference in Albuquerque, NM in September.<br/>
