<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465368127">I am hoping someone out there has the magical answer. <br/>
<br/>
I am trying to figure out a way to store all of my girls toys so they<br/>
can have easier access to them. <br/>
<br/>
A few years ago I bought shoe organizers. They had two shelves and<br/>
could be stacked. I took the second shelf and moved it so that I<br/>
basically had a long rectangle. I stacked these 3 high so I had 3<br/>
shelves and the top to put stuff on. I took everything out of their<br/>
boxes and stored each item in a small plastic rectangular tub and then<br/>
put them on the shelf. My kids could go grab a tub and bring it to the<br/>
table, sit on the floor whatever. When they were done they could just<br/>
throw it all back into the tub which made it a lot easier and faster<br/>
on them. Well I didn&#39;t keep the shelves because they weren&#39;t that<br/>
sturdy and now I&#39;m regretting it. <br/>
<br/>
All of our games, toys, etc are stored in plastic bags to save space<br/>
so stacking them on a bookshelf wouldn&#39;t be an option. <br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t want to use really tall bookshelves since I have younger<br/>
ones (7 and 4) and want them to be able to reach it all. <br/>
<br/>
I welcome any ideas or insight as to what you do. Thank you in advance. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980065495">I have two girls ages 7 and 4. A few years ago I bought wood stacking<br/>
shoe shelves to put a lot of the girls toys in. The shelves had 4<br/>
pieces. Two side pieces, a top piece and a moveable shelf. I took  the<br/>
moveable shelf piece and put it so that the whole shelf thing made a<br/>
rectangle. I then stacked them 3 high and made 4 or 5 rows this way.<br/>
The toys I put in small plastic boxes so that the girls could see what<br/>
was inside each box. When they wanted to play with something they<br/>
could get the box and sit at the table, on the floor or wherever. When<br/>
they were ready to put it away they could just put it all back in the<br/>
box and be off to the next box or whatever else. I wasn&#39;t able to keep<br/>
these shelves because of lack of stability. The weren&#39;t very sturdy<br/>
after moving them around a few times. <br/>
<br/>
My question is that I am not sure what to do with these toys. We do<br/>
not keep boxes for games, blocks, etc as it takes up so much room.<br/>
Most things are stored in plastic bags. I now have plastic tubs with<br/>
the bags thrown in there. Problem is that the girls can&#39;t really see<br/>
much of what is in there. <br/>
<br/>
How do you keep track of all the toys? I want something easy for my<br/>
girls to get at but also something that isn&#39;t so tall. If anyone has<br/>
any suggestions, photos, etc I would appreciate it. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-17281627">we got a bunch of bins from IKEA. My kids can sort things how they<br/>
like. And reach it all.<br/>
its called TROFAST<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/rooms/childrens_room/12018/">http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/rooms/childrens_room/12018/</a><br/>
It is kind of cheap, cheaper than I could make myself but obviously<br/>
not as nice.<br/>
For games in bags how about and old record cabinet, they have slots<br/>
about 3&quot; apart.<br/>
we put pixs on the outside of boxes for easy reference. ok, one handed<br/>
typing is not working. hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-641928260">If you are keeping things in baggies you could always switch to the<br/>
book and tape baggies that have a hanger on them or just attach your<br/>
baggies to small plastic kid hangers.  You could add an extra bar to<br/>
your closet (or two!) and just hang things.    We use lots of<br/>
dishpans, shelves, wire cube units and the hanging method for our<br/>
stuff... we have LOTS of stuff and it&#39;s always a battle to organize<br/>
it!    I have been buying the lower shelves lately because they are<br/>
better for little climbers (my 6 yr old is a climber and has been<br/>
since birth!)  It works better for me also since he can easily reach<br/>
everything on his own (doing things on his own is important to him<br/>
right now!)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495905237">I&#39;ve been having a similar dilemma. I&#39;m not nearly as organized. So far, all of our stuff is in buckets or a toy box and most of it is inaccesable. I thought I had found some furniture that would work for stacking and storing things. My husband told me not to buy it because he can build it (haha!). I like the idea of clear plastic tubs stacked on shoe racks or some other cubby type stand. <br/>
   <br/>
  Where do you keep the storage units? We have a playroom upstairs that is packed full of toys strewn everywhere as well as the TV and computer. Downstairs I set up the formal dining room to be a play/activity room. That&#39;s where I imagined we&#39;d do our artsy/craftsy stuff, (no carpet so easier clean up), building (room to leave stuff set up indefinitely), etc. So, that would be where I&#39;d put the cubby units. The problem is that we are hardly ever down there right now. Life is just not conducive to hanging out in that room right now. <br/>
   <br/>
  Do you all have one room dedicated to your stuff or do you put things in different rooms depending on their use?<br/>
