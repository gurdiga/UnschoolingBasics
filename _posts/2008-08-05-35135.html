adore Dad (as do I) and I always feel like they have such limited time with him, so I tend to <br/>
see that time before they crash (between 8-10) as time for Dad.  As a result, I have no <br/>
time alone with either of the other two.  But the connection I feel with my Ds1 seems to be <br/>
in tact.  Ds1 did reject me quite a bit after ds2 was born but not so dramatically and not <br/>
for as long.  I can see how badly ds2 is suffering for attention from me.  (And him <br/>
shrieking at me is no bowl of cherries for me either.) The other thing about this that has <br/>
been tough is the shifting on a dime.  What I mean is, when ds2 and I are alone and <br/>

back to yelling.  I can&#39;t seem to satisfy or saturate him enough.  <br/>
<br/>
Can we recover?  How?  How can I meet his needs without sacrificing dd&#39;s?  How can I be <br/>
sure not to create a rift between the youngest two?  It feels like this is getting worse.  He is <br/>
angrier with every passing day I mean.  I feel very stuck when my dd needs me, b/c it <br/>
actually feels like I AM choosing her over him.  Maybe I am b/c I view her needs as greater.  <br/>
That sucks! Admittedly, we haven&#39;t addressed this seriously until now. <br/>
<br/>
ALso, any literature suggestions?  <br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I&#39;m a mess about this...too distraught to see the obvious.  I also want to know if I <br/>
can repair the seeming damage?  Is this too dramatic a view? (I can certainly be dramatic.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558172422">I have a a 10 month old (toddler) so I understand how hard it feels to leave<br/>
a child that young and attached. I also have a 5ds and 11dd. I found shortly<br/>
after 10month dd was born ds5 felt rather rejected by me and acted in<br/>
rejecting ways towards me and was very angry (I even wrote on here about his<br/>
hitting). Fortunately we have reconnected and we are all good friends again.<br/>
However, it took work. I had to regain his trust and &quot;prove&quot; that I loved<br/>
him, in his way.<br/>
<br/>
He is all about papa so when dh comes home ds5 will usually get his<br/>
attention first. After a while we &quot;trade&quot;. I take ds5 and papa takes dd10<br/>
mon. We also take turns at ds5 bedtime (by this I mean when he is ready for<br/>
bed) he generally wants a story or to play Pokemon.<br/>
<br/>
I also use baby&#39;s nap time to read or play DS or chat with ds5. dd11 is<br/>
usually still sleeping during the baby&#39;s morning nap. For a couple weeks I<br/>
just rarely cleaned to make sure I was giving ds5 every moment I could.<br/>
After a like while he would clean with me or do his own thing. He wasn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;starved&quot; for attention. I realize it was my doing that undid us and that I<br/>
needed to make great efforts to repair it. I still didn&#39;t feel like I was<br/>
paying my dd11 much attention, so I go and hang out with her several times a<br/>
week after both the smaller ones go to sleep. Its hard to stretch myself but<br/>
worth it. I still give them all I have during the days but I had to<br/>
consiously carve out personal time with them. I just want to put it out<br/>
there that it took time and energy to regain that connection.<br/>
<br/>
On the weekends I will leave dd10mon with dh and take a small walk or<br/>
something with one of my older kids. Or I can throw her in a backpack and<br/>
give most of my attention to ds5 or dd11 depending on what we are doing. If<br/>
you have a sling or patapum or something that might really help you.<br/>
<br/>
I have found it helpful to engage him on his level with his interests. I<br/>
have become quite the pokemon fan because of his interests. We read, play<br/>
and watch pokemon together. I have learned all the ins and outs of it so I<br/>
can intelligently discuss it. With my dd11 I read many of the same books as<br/>
she does so we can talk about them.<br/>
<br/>
It took about 30 minutes to write this. I read and the played then wrote<br/>
then played then wrote then played. I built a castle, threw fratiles,<br/>
cleaned up a set of toys to make room, helped ds findsomething, nursed the<br/>
baby, built the baby a tower or three to knock down, spun a wooden top<br/>
repeatedly...you get the idea. I didn&#39;t just sit here and do email. I don&#39;t<br/>
know if you have or have space for a playroom. It has been great since we<br/>
moved and have the space. It is set up baby safe and fun. SO I can play with<br/>
ds5 at the times the baby is occupied. My computer is up here so I also can<br/>
get an email or two in every once and again. I can take 5 minute mini-breaks<br/>
without the kids feeling like I even left. I stop and go back to them before<br/>
they miss me (most of the time)<br/>
<br/>
They need me<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266621018">Would you leave her for an hour? it doesn&#39;t have to be every day, but  <br/>
once a week take him to the grocery store. Get your groceries (and I  <br/>
would find stuff that we didnt&#39; really need, if we didn&#39;t need  <br/>
anything) The best ever was buying a soda at the end and sitting on  <br/>
the curb drinking it together. Just talking. Sometimes going to get  <br/>
an ice cream cone, or for a new book, or just to feed the ducks. When  <br/>
they can depend on that, it makes the rest of the week easier.<br/>
Each day, when dh is ready, he can be with DS1 and DD while DS2  <br/>
&#39;helps&#39; you. I find that if I ask my children, &quot;I need help washing  <br/>
this pot,&quot; or &quot;Would you like to crack the eggs for dinner?&quot; that  <br/>
just those five or six minutes is really a great way to feel  <br/>
connected, even while working. Even if tasks don&#39;t NEED to be done,  <br/>
but my kids seem to enjoy feeling like they are helping, so an extra  <br/>
batch of cookies never is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sick today so if it&#39;s short, forgive me. I think if you just look  <br/>
outside the box, also, realize that dh&#39;s time is not more important  <br/>
than having him with two kids so you can reconnect with one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30291914"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;ALso, any literature suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Parenting from the Inside Out: How a deeper self-understanding can  <br/>
help you raise children who thrive.  I have been reading it on the  <br/>
advice of a friend who&#39;s a marriage and family therapist. I&#39;m finding  <br/>
it useful. I just finished Chapter 8 &quot;How we disconnect and reconnect:  <br/>
rupture and repair&quot;.  Seems like this chapter may apply even if you  <br/>
had a blissful childhood and don&#39;t feel the need of self-examination.<br/>
Gordon Neufeld&#39;s book on attachment Hold onto your kids was pivotal  <br/>
for me, and I also bought (online) the audio of his presentation on  <br/>
counterwill.<br/>
My friend the therapist also recommended Daniel Hughes as an author  <br/>
who writes about ways to maximize your attachment(s) with children. I  <br/>
haven&#39;t read any of his stuff yet.  I see he has a new book coming out  <br/>
this fall Principles of Attachment-Focused Parenting: Effective  <br/>
Strategies to Care for Children. His other books seem to focus mainly  <br/>
on traumatized and/or adopted/foster children. I may wait for the new  <br/>
book; I haven&#39;t decided.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;If you have a sling or patapum or something that might really help  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>you.<br/>
<br/>
I second this comment on the sling. I try to wear my 6 month old dd as  <br/>
much as possible. It does free me to play more with my two older  <br/>
children than when I carrying her in my arms. One of the added  <br/>
benefits is my dh or MIL can wear her too, and it&#39;s a source of comfort.<br/>
