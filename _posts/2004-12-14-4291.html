<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103791191">Hi all.  I never post here, so you all don&#39;t know me, but I do read <br/>
here a lot and have been reading at unschooling.com for several <br/>
years now.<br/>
<br/>
We just found out that we will be moving to the Spokane area in the <br/>
spring sometime - to Fairchild AFB.  We would so love to meet some <br/>
unschoolers because it&#39;s been a long time since we had anyone to <br/>
hang out with/play with.  We have 2 daughters - one will be 10 and <br/>
the other 5 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone in the Spokane area?  Does anyone have any advice about <br/>
unschooling in Washington?  I would love to hear from anyone!  <br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ll be moving to some Air Force Base next summer (from Andrews), <br/>
but still no idea which one. <br/>
<br/>
Hope you like it at Fairchild!<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re coming back to the U.S.?!! YAY!!  <br/>
I know it&#39;s not Spokane, but Markus and I are looking at buying some <br/>
property up North for a summer getaway. We&#39;ve most recently been <br/>
looking at the SE corner of Idaho, figuring we&#39;d be on I-84 and have <br/>
a straight shot to Portland for seeing family.<br/>
<br/>
WA laws weren&#39;t too bad when we were there. I&#39;ll let some WA folks <br/>
give you details though, it&#39;s been a few years for us.<br/>

I don&#39;t have any advice for you, but I have a friend<br/>
who recently moved to that area, and she says it&#39;s<br/>
absolutely beautiful up there! I hope you enjoy<br/>
it...my friend is!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340976384">Welcome to Washington!  I live CLEAR on the other side<br/>
of the state, in Bellingham, but hubby and I went to<br/>
college in Spokane, and we drive through now and then.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I have no advice for homeschooling laws--we<br/>
just moved back to Washington and we are &quot;under the<br/>
radar&quot; as I don&#39;t want to have to deal with it ;)<br/>
<br/>
But good to have more unschoolers moving into the<br/>
state!<br/>

It&#39;s a yahoo group for Washington state homeschoolers/unschoolers, <br/>
etc. (It&#39;s not strictly unschooling - the include homeschoolers, <br/>
eclectic, unschoolers, etc.). Most of the people seem to be based on <br/>
the West side of the state, but I know there are a couple of people <br/>
who post there who live in Eastern Washington.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and welcome to the Pacific NW! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884737831">Thank you everyone who responded!  I&#39;ll definitely check out the <br/>
links.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, Ren, we will be coming back to the states - hopefully a couple <br/>
of months earlier than we anticipated.  We are so ready.  Dh has <br/>
also been gone for 3 months already - deployed to Qatar - and he has <br/>
one month to go yet.  So he&#39;s missing all of our family birthdays as <br/>
well as all the good holidays :(  We&#39;ve been lonely lately.<br/>
<br/>
We think that we would eventually like to buy land in the NW too, <br/>
but we aren&#39;t in a position to do that just yet.  Maybe after we <br/>
live there for a few years.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks all of you with good wishes, and we may try to stay &quot;under <br/>
the radar&quot; too - not sure yet.<br/>
<br/>
