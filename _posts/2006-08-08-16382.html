My son is 12 and your son sounds like he has the exact same type of behavior. Ds also feels terrible after he has been ugly to (one or all of) us and apoligizes. He cries and hugs, but next time atround he seems to have just as hard a time stopping it from happening again. It is hard on all of us, because we know with our heads that he does not mean what he says at that time, but it still hurts, esp. his 9 yo sister.I know he has  pain (related to relinquishment by birthmom) to deal with and he says that is why he feels these &quot;moods&quot; are happening. <br/>
I have been thinking that seeing a counselor might be very good for him to work things out inside himself, but he is adamant that he won&#39;t, because &quot;that hurts too much!&quot;.<br/>
Not sure what to do to help him at this time (other than obvious hugs, attention, love, understanding...).<br/>
I agree that unschooling is the only way to go for him. At least it gives him control over his life now, even if that was not the case before, when he was so hurt.<br/>
Anyway, keep up your spirits and answer him with &quot;I love you!&quot; and a smile maybe...<br/>

Thanks, Sybelle, for this. Sometimes I feel like we&#39;re the only ones <br/>
out here. My 7 y/o can hear my oldest&#39;s tone of voice and know what <br/>
kind of mood he&#39;s in. We all do. It&#39;s upsetting to know that we <br/>
don&#39;t know what can set him off, sometimes. Things ARE much better <br/>
with unschooling though.<br/>
<br/>
I do wonder what happens with kids like this as adults. Does anyone <br/>
have an account of what that&#39;s like with an adult who had this type <br/>
of behavior as a child?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My oldest child was a lot like this for the first 7 or 8 years of her<br/>
life.  Since we started unschooling we have seen it less and less.  My<br/>
son has difficulty expressing his needs or making them known in a<br/>
timely manner (as in by the time we finally figure it out it&#39;s too<br/>
late and he has exploded.)  The past year, though has been wonderful<br/>
in comparison to previous years and every day we see more and more<br/>
ease in our relationship.  Not only because he is maturing, but also<br/>
because he has learned to trust us.  That doesn&#39;t mean that there<br/>
isn&#39;t the ocaissional outburst (that usually happens now more between<br/>
siblings) but that they have become fewer and have a much higher<br/>
&quot;boiling point.&quot;  The biggest thing is gaining their trust and letting<br/>
them know that you are going to be their helper through this &quot;big bad<br/>
world&quot; rather than feed them to the wolves.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is hard to look at adults who behaved &quot;poorly&quot; (read: were<br/>
misunderstood as children) and compare what their lives are like as we<br/>
probably have very few adults today who were homeschooled.  I know<br/>
when I was going to school homeschooling was against the law where I<br/>
lived.  So the few adults my age from around here that were<br/>
homeschooled were usually classically schooled (and parented) and<br/>
doing so under the radar.  We don&#39;t have generations of unschooled<br/>
children to look at.  I think we are just starting to get into some<br/>
second generations and even those are fairly few and far between.<br/>
