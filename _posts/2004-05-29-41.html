<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783966877">Hi, My name is Adele, I&#39;m new to unschooling. My children are 4 and 5 <br/>
and never been to school. We&#39;ve always had fun learning through our <br/>
play, but when I decided that we were homeschooling I found myself <br/>
doing school at home. It took me awhile to realize that I was doing <br/>
to them what I didn&#39;t want the school system to do. So, I&#39;m now <br/>
working hard on deschooling myself. Right now, I&#39;m battling myself. <br/>
But, the joy of learning is once again returning to the house. I look <br/>
forward to learning from all of you and I can really use the help to <br/>
deschool myself.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ve been to the two SC Live and Learn Conferences.  I have a 7 YO son  and a 4 <br/>

I owe so much to the unschoolers on this list for helping me get past my  <br/>
worries and living this joyful life.   It is amazing to me how much  <br/>
de-programming I need sometimes.<br/>

I wonder  how it is for other unschoolers with just one child at home.<br/>
I wonder if I  dropped making her do the schooly bits if she would want <br/>
to read and write  soon? (If she could read herself, a world of books <br/>
would be avail to her  all day long = less need for other kids).<br/>
Greetings from down  under<br/>
Angela&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Again, I apologize for not responding earlier. In box is quite full of  <br/>
things I wanted to atlk about but haven&#39;t yet.<br/>
 <br/>
Angela, I have two boys, but basically, they&#39;re two onlys. They are eight  <br/>
years apart.<br/>
 <br/>
THey each have their own sets of friends. I AM the taxi, playmate, reader,  <br/>
---everything to my eight years old---as I was for my 16 year old. But they <br/>
both  have friends, and I get them over here----or taxi mine over there as often <br/>
as  possible.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling MEANS not forcing the reading and writing. It&#39;s not forcing  <br/>
anything! If you were to give up the forced reading and writing, she probably  <br/>
WILL avoid it for all she&#39;s worth for several months or more. But she&#39;d come  <br/>
back when it started to mean something to her----when she started to need those  <br/>
things for information or communication. <br/>
 <br/>
Back off. Let her explore. Get books on tape or Jim Weiss&#39; stories on CD.  <br/>
Let her HEAR great literature and storytelling while she&#39;s playing with dolls or <br/>
 tickling the dog or building with Legos. The world of books could be open to <br/>
her  NOW----through tapes and DCs, if *you&#39;re* willing!  &lt;G&gt; Just because she <br/>
can&#39;t read doesn&#39;t mean that books aren&#39;t  available to her----or shouldn&#39;t <br/>
be available to her!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Kelly,for your encouragement. In the end, the only way to find <br/>
out is by doing it. So I&#39;ve just thought about the &#39;worst case <br/>
scenario&#39; if I stop pushing her to write. Well, I have no doubt that <br/>
she will want to learn to write at some stage, so the only risk is that <br/>
she is &#39;behind&#39; for a while. Not much of a risk, when I think about <br/>
it...<br/>
My 14yo dd loves doing art and writing fiction novels and I never told <br/>
her to do it, just goes to prove it, doesn&#39;t it. Things have already <br/>
improved. She&#39;s happy now to stay at her friends&#39; place so the &#39;child <br/>
swap thing&#39; can start now. We love our time together and I read lots <br/>
and lots to her. And now that I will stop spending my precious time <br/>
pushing her to do things she doesn&#39;t want to do, we will finally have <br/>
time to do the things we really want to do, like the sugar crystal <br/>
experiment that came from Robert Krampf last week. Today she asked me <br/>
again about fungi so we can spend out time learning about that now. She <br/>
is so interested in finding out about the world around her at this age, <br/>
better make the most of it. I&#39;ve learnt more in the way of science in <br/>
this year of hs her than I&#39;ve learned in all my life so far, just by <br/>
looking up her questions....<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t come across Jim Weiss stories, what is that about?<br/>
<br/>
Also, has anyone read John Holt&#39;s book on how he learned the cello the <br/>
Suzuki way? I&#39;m wondering if the Suzuki way today is still how it was <br/>
originally?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the long list of books and info you posted in the other <br/>
intro mail.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867757395">&quot;Well, I have no doubt that<br/>
she will want to learn to write at some stage, so the only risk is <br/>
that<br/>
she is &#39;behind&#39; for a while. Not much of a risk, when I think about<br/>
it...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are you &quot;behind&quot; me because you don&#39;t own your own unschooling list?<br/>
No.<br/>
Am I &quot;behind&quot; you because you know things I might not know?<br/>
No.<br/>
Is any adult considered &quot;behind&quot; because one is great with numbers <br/>
and logic and another is fabulous with color and design?<br/>
Of course not.<br/>
&quot;Behind&quot; is a ridiculous notion, only used in the bizarre setting of <br/>
school. There is no behind or ahead in the  real world. Only being <br/>
who you are. We all have different skills, different interests, <br/>
different capabilities in our use of language and just about every <br/>
other topic or subject.<br/>
Who cares?<br/>
That&#39;s the beauty of human beings...we are all DIFFERENT!!:)<br/>
That&#39;s a good thing in life.<br/>
<br/>
Stop thinking of her as &quot;ahead&quot; or &quot;behind&quot; anyone else. She&#39;s just <br/>
being HER. If her reading or writing skills are less than another <br/>
person, who cares? If she&#39;s a lot better than another human, it <br/>
matters not.<br/>
What matters is that she is living the life of her choosing, doing <br/>
that which she loves. THAT is what leads to true success in this <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
I have a two year old staying in my house right now. He can read <br/>
ANYTHING. I am not exaggerating when I tell you he reads better than <br/>
my 7 year old (who is an avid reader and writer). She was trying to <br/>
read him a story a couple nights ago, and he was helping her out <br/>
with the words she couldn&#39;t read throughout the entire book. She <br/>
laughed and said &quot;Will is helping me read Mama.&quot;<br/>
It didn&#39;t matter that he was &quot;ahead&quot; according to some school <br/>
schedule, or that she was 7 and not able to read like this child. <br/>
They were just friends, having fun together and doing what they <br/>
could do.<br/>
My 11 year old is just starting to read. Both my 7 y.o. dd and our <br/>
little 2y.o. friend are reading more than him. It doesn&#39;t matter. <br/>
Jared is confident in himself, knows the things he loves and learns <br/>
with joy. Isn&#39;t that more important than some false time table?<br/>
I say YES.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-845937353">So for a week now I have finally left my nearly 6yo dd alone and our <br/>
time together has been much more fun and pleasant. It is so draining to <br/>
try and make someone do something they don&#39;t want to do. I also really <br/>
know now from experiencing it again and again that teaching her is the <br/>
wrong thing to do. It kills the fun for her every time. So thanks for <br/>
your encouragement to help me take the plunge.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question re coming to a consensus in the family. I want to <br/>
move to another part of NZ to where I believe is a bigger hs group with <br/>
hopefully more unschoolers (here are none). Also, I think we would find <br/>
more friends for my dd to play with and I might find a few more for <br/>
myself. My dh is open to the idea although he is apprehensive about <br/>
teaching in a new school (he&#39;s a high school teacher, but don&#39;t judge <br/>
him by that) but willing to take the risk. My 14yo dd however doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to move at all. She says that it will take ages finding new <br/>
friends, if she&#39;d find any at all and she is happy here. She attends <br/>
high school and likes it for the social life. She doesn&#39;t want to home <br/>
school. She&#39;ll finish school in 4 yrs. I don&#39;t really feel ok about <br/>
just doing what I think will be beneficial for myself and 5yodd  <br/>
without having both dh and older dd on board. But waiting another 4 yrs <br/>
is a long time .... Of course I don&#39;t know for sure if a move would be <br/>
making life better, it&#39;s all guess work. I have a friend living where <br/>
I&#39;d want to go and have thought of going over for 3 month just with the <br/>
girls for a trial, but my older dd doesn&#39;t want to. I could go over <br/>
just for a month and suss things out for myself and 5yodd but of course <br/>
that still leaves older dd against it. Any ideas on this anyone?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-586924025">My dh grew up in a family that moved every couple years.  It was very<br/>
difficult for him.  The hardest move of all of them was the move they made<br/>
just before he entered high school.  I would think that would be a very<br/>
difficult time to move and I would think that you might very well alienate<br/>
your older dd by not taking her needs into consideration.  Perhaps you could<br/>
continue to seek out regular homeschoolers in your area and maybe you&#39;ll be<br/>
surprised to find some relaxed ones who just need a little knowledge about<br/>
unschooling and some real life support to make that leap.Or at least you<br/>
might find some that are gentle parents.   I guess before I made a decision<br/>
like that that might adversely affect other members of my family, I&#39;d make<br/>
sure I exhausted every possibility to find and make friends in the area that<br/>
you are in.  (not to say you haven&#39;t already.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is what a very wise friend told me once, &quot;Sometimes one member of the family must give up or do something that they don&#39;t want for the benefit of the entire family.&quot;  The thing to figure out is who in your situation is sacrficing something.  Is it your desire to be in a more open homeschooling community or your older dd who will have to make new friends?  Your older dd moving has 4 years of high school left.  I&#39;m quite sure that in that amount of time that she could indeed find many new friends.  You, your younger dd and your dh would have to do the same thing as well.  <br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t say how far away this new town is, but knowing the size of NZ, it isn&#39;t huge so a periodic trip back to visit her best friends probably wouldn&#39;t be that difficult, would it?  And if it is the social aspect of high school that she enjoys, then perhaps finding out about those social interactions at her new school might make things easier for her.  And sometimes, although it seems cruel, parents make decisions for a family that not all members are happy about at the beginning.  <br/>
<br/>
Is this a for sure able to do thing?  I would presume that your dh would need to find a job first and then you would move?  Or could your family risk moving without finding a job first?  (I know there is a teacher shortage here, but I don&#39;t recommend moving here - I want to move *there* LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your decision!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-894858884">Personally, I think I&#39;d make it a point to go there on vacation, as a family. That way, DH could check out the schools and get an idea of what is available to him. You would get to get an idea of what groups are where, and maybe even spend some time with them to get an idea of which groups you would care to join. The girls would get an opportunity to meet some of the kids in the area, and maybe your oldest dd would meet a friend she could keep in touch with to make it a smoother transition if you choose to move. Something to keep in mind if your oldest dd is still against it...While I understand that it may not seem &#39;right&#39; to make a choice beneficial to all but her, it&#39;s also not right to choose on the basis of what feels right to just her either, that&#39;s going to be at the cross-road no matter which way you decide, unfortunately.<br/>
    My oldest son also attends school at the high school here. His choice. But I am learning not to allow his choice hinder the opportunities out there for my younger two at home either. We do as much as we can when he is with us , but lets face it - we do some pretty cool stuff in the name of &#39;school&#39; here, lol. He seems jealous some times that his younger Sib&#39;s have the time and opportunities to explore their curiosities, but that was his decision also - kwim?<br/>
 Good luck, and best wishes. <br/>

<br/>
Well. I disagree. :) I&#39;d advise against forcing or trying to force the older <br/>
child to move against her will. I&#39;d probably even say I think it&#39;s an <br/>
exceptionally bad idea.   <br/>
<br/>
It would be changing her life against her will and from her viewpoint for the <br/>
worse, in order to maybe make life better for the younger child. Forcing one <br/>
child to forsake her currently quite happy social life in order to maybe <br/>
improve the social life of the other child is already not such a hot idea - when <br/>
you add the fact that the older child is at an age where friends are often <br/>
hugely important while the younger is at an age where many children feel their most <br/>
important relations are with the family it looks even worse. I think it&#39;d be <br/>
a setup almost guaranteed to prompt resentment directed not only toward the <br/>
mother but also toward the younger child, affecting their relationship for life. <br/>
I can easily imagine the teen feeling she was being punished for not wanting <br/>
to join in this &quot;great&quot; new experiment her mother is engaged in. Ya know? As <br/>
well as the obvious feelings of being loved and cared for less than the younger <br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is anywhere near the same as doing cool things with the <br/>
unschooled kids while the schooled kid is in school. <br/>
<br/>
14 can be a really tough age to be. I&#39;d not add to the angst myself without <br/>
being really really really sure it would all be for the best for everyone <br/>
involved. This is so tenative an idea I personally would go very very VERY slowly <br/>
at checking it out, thinking about it, making friends via email in the area. <br/>
Four years might be a long time but they could seem even longer if you&#39;re living <br/>
with a resentful teen. :)<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I&#39;d spend a good part of the next school vacation there if <br/>
I could, especially if I could manage to not set it up as pressuring the teen <br/>
to see how great it would be, but just as a vacation and checking it out for <br/>
everyone.<br/>
<br/>
This probably sounds harsh. It isn&#39;t meant so. Imagine it as a friend with a <br/>
very worried tone in her voice. :-)<br/>

Look at parents who are military who move every 3-4years.  Or the parents who do contract work.  Or parents who decide to have that mid-life career change.  The parents are the ones that support the family and if a move  is desired then it is then the parents&#39; responsibility to make the move as less stressful and smooth as possible.  Perhaps this would be a non-issue for our family as we have moved several times and our children trust that we will provide for them and ease them through their moving transitions.

I&#39;ve BEEN the military parent moving, and the military spouse moving as well. <br/>
This situation isn&#39;t remotely like moving on orders. <br/>
<br/>
I think that taking the attitude of &quot;that&#39;s life&quot; in this situation is <br/>
horribly counter to the intent of the contemplated move. It&#39;s casually dismissing a <br/>
child&#39;s feelings as unimportant. In search of maybe possibly community for one <br/>
member, the parent is contemplating forcing another to leave her already <br/>
established community. I&#39;m pretty baffled as to how &quot;That&#39;s life&quot; fits into trying <br/>
to move toward a more unschooling friendly life.<br/>

<br/>
Great! I do hope though that if one of your children mysteriously develops <br/>
roots in a place you&#39;ll give them the consideration of listening to them and <br/>
taking their reluctance seriously, not just dismiss them with a cavalier &quot;that&#39;s <br/>
life!&quot; Not everyone is able to feel adventurous about packing up and moving <br/>
on. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a sign of superior parenting or superior intelligence. <br/>
People are different. It&#39;s good for people to honor those differences as much as <br/>
possible. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m deeply distressed to hear unschooling parents casually advising others to <br/>
simply disregard a child&#39;s clearly stated deep feelings about a huge change <br/>
in her life.   <br/>
