<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050746786">&quot;Problem is, that&#39;s the<br/>
theory. In practice she chooses to spend her time reading or being on<br/>
the pc etc rather than doing the bit she has agreed to do. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a lot of stress to me.<br/>
Sounds like she isn&#39;t &quot;choosing&quot; the chores at all, but saying what <br/>
Mom wants to hear. You won&#39;t get total honesty (she probably hates <br/>
chores) until you relax.<br/>
It&#39;s funny, because everyone imagines in a house of freedom, that <br/>
the kids are just ignoring the Parents needs and making messes <br/>
everywhere...that isn&#39;t the truth.<br/>
My kids have different priorities than I do, if I saw their lack of <br/>
help as robbing MY freedom and time, then I would resent it more.<br/>
If I see their messes as them being busy with their interests and <br/>
more involved with other things than house cleaning (good for them) <br/>
it changes my attitude and I can ask for help without a bunch of <br/>
baggage attached.<br/>
<br/>
As to the food restrictions, it sounds like your child has zero self <br/>
control...that&#39;s caused by controlling their food intake for them. <br/>
It will take a long time for her to begin listening to her body <br/>
again and make true choices rather than act out of neediness or lack.<br/>
If she&#39;s wanting you to control it again, that&#39;s a sign of someone <br/>
unable to make their own decisions. Better she re-learn how to make <br/>
her own food choices now, rather than as an adult.<br/>
Instead of leaving her to fend for herself (scary when someone has <br/>
been controlling you) why don&#39;t you try saying &quot;yes&quot; more and more?<br/>
Eventually, she will be making her own food choices and not feeling <br/>
so needy.<br/>
