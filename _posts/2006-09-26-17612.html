<div id="ygrps-yiv-877251359">Hello,,,I have just done a major search on this site..and oh <br/>
boy,,there are a million &quot;timeouts&quot; written in the messages.,so i <br/>
guess to many this may bore you but I have a toddler and a baby and <br/>
am looking for ways to deal my toddler without time outs! We are <br/>
going through a rough time with hitting and yelling at the baby <br/>
brother..He has decided to yell &quot; NO ORIEN&quot; to everything a 5 month <br/>
old can do.look out a car window, hold and play with a toy etc..I <br/>
have been trying the conversation on why yelling hurts feelings, <br/>
scares his brother..but doesnt matter..we are also dealing with <br/>
hitting the baby,,,I know this is for attention...an try to stop to <br/>
play/interact most of the timebut when I amcooking him <br/>
breakfast....washing dishes etc...he gets into the hitting and <br/>
expecially whenthe PHONE RINGS!! Any sugggestions..as we are trying <br/>
to sort out the unschooling philosophy! Anyone deal with being the <br/>
odd momma out by not doing time outs..everyone I talk to just <br/>
says &quot;oh they work form my child&quot; but years later they are still in <br/>
timeouts for the same reasons.and they work I guess because the <br/>
child cried??? I dont know&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
thanks natalie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480305863">Yeah....long reasons usually don&#39;t work with toddlers. In our house  <br/>
we just know that housework and cooking is way backburner for us,  <br/>
especially if Dan or Sam are having a hard day. Even if it comes down  <br/>
to pb&j sandwiches again, better to interact BEFORE the yelling or  <br/>
hitting starts.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go, speaking of interacting!!<br/>

LOL!)  Just not good as punishment or discipline.  Sometimes children need<br/>
some quiet time to relax after a particularly difficult time or to calm down<br/>
or to refocus.  That doesn&#39;t mean that they have to do it alone in their<br/>
room (or gods forbid in a corner) Some quiet time with a book and mom, a<br/>
relaxing movie or music, a peaceful walk outside, etc.  Sometimes *I* need<br/>
some &quot;time out&quot; from the hustle and bustle of life.  :)<br/>
<br/>
If the phone is a known issue, screen your calls.  Call back people who<br/>
don&#39;t have an immediate need (such as your friend who is calling to chat<br/>
because she is bored or your mom who is just checking in to see how your<br/>
week is going) and only take the important calls (your SO with a change in<br/>
work schedule or the power company who is giving you a courtesy call before<br/>
they turn off your power because you failed to pay your bill, but you know<br/>
you did and fortunately were smart enough to copy off the online<br/>
confirmation of payment page 2 weeks ago - not that that has happened or<br/>
anything :)  )  Make those calls when your son (or sons) are involved in<br/>
other things that you know they are safe doing (napping, playing with dad,<br/>
at a friend&#39;s house, out with grandpa, etc.)  *Be* there with your children<br/>
when your children need you.  The other stuff can wait (really it can!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going through this with our younger child who is 2yo. Instead of the often punitive <br/>
tone of &quot;time outs&quot; we call it &quot;taking a break&quot;. When things are getting a little intense and <br/>
we can&#39;t diffuse it in the scene, I ask if it would help to take a break. Then I see if he needs <br/>
some time to himself or if he wants me to be with him. (I still do this with our 6yo, and <br/>
myself at times...)<br/>
<br/>
My older son was always the one who wanted to be with me through his break. We&#39;d just <br/>
tuck in and do something quiet. Play-doh, playing with water (even a bath sometimes), <br/>
reading were things that really seemed helpful. I&#39;ve heard of other people having a little <br/>
spot for this kind of safe, quiet space with things that help calm--like containers of soft <br/>
materials (silks, velvets) and items (cotton balls,  clay, whatever they found to be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
My younger son is more the type that needs his space. He usually chooses to be alone, but <br/>
with me not far from him. Yesterday, he wanted me to stay in the room and &quot;watch&quot; him, <br/>
which I read to mean he wanted silent company. (Sometimes I try to be too helpful and use <br/>
too many words...)<br/>
<br/>
Once they reach balance again, it seems like they can be more receptive (and I can be <br/>
more patient and creative and positive). And that&#39;s when the gentle hands reminder has <br/>
more effect. And we can practice soft touch and talk about safety. And also about other <br/>
ways/words to use when he does need attention or something he&#39;s not getting. Take a <br/>
deep breath, it takes lots of repitition. They need to know they are safe and cared for and <br/>
will test that many times each day.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the post...it&#39;s always great to revisit these topics with fresh eyes,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-568256111">The thing that really popped out for me is the fact that the 2 year<br/>
old has not had his mom to himself for very long!<br/>
<br/>
Try seeing this whole situation from his point of view: everything was<br/>
perfect until this baby showed up and now...well...<br/>
<br/>
Someone explained it this way one time, &quot;Imagine your husband loves<br/>
you very much and one day he brings home a younger, cuter woman and<br/>
tells you that he loves her very much and he loves you very much and<br/>
you need to accept this new lady as family and love her, too, and she<br/>
will share your bed and she will go out on dates with you, and you<br/>
need to share all of your clothes and makeup and books with her.&quot; Now<br/>
imagine that you didn&#39;t have language to express how that would make<br/>
you feel!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I know a lot of people could get mired in guilt from this<br/>
perspective, but let it go... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719589030">Hello everyone, I am new to the group as I went searching online for <br/>
some unschool info and came across you nice folks.  Thanks for being <br/>
here, and I am sure I will gain alot of info and inspiration from <br/>
you.<br/>
I wanted to comment on the Time Out issue, and in discipline in <br/>
general, if you don&#39;t mind.  I have been thinking so much about this <br/>
lately.  I have a 7 yrold and almost 3 yrold...boys.  I have tried <br/>
every method of discipline on the market.  (yes, sadly, I have paid <br/>
money for people to tell me how to count from 1 to 3...pathetic, I <br/>
know)  The one thing that DH and I were talking about today is the <br/>
fact that WHEN they are misbehaving is generally when we are not <br/>
available to them emotionally...we might be on the computer, or <br/>
reading the paper, or on the telephone. or just plain not paying <br/>
attention to them. We talked about our attachment parenting...how we <br/>
let it slack off, and the theory being that if our kids are being <br/>
out of control and having problems, then WE are at fault for what I <br/>
call &quot;Lazy Parenting&quot;  or as our parents used to say &quot;Knock it off <br/>
and go find something to do&quot;.<br/>
We (DH and I) have to constantly guard ourselves against this kind <br/>
of thinking, becuase, we chose to have these wonderful beings in our <br/>
lives, and now..yes...here they are.  Sometimes they interfere with <br/>
what WE want, but tough.  Truthfully, when we are attentive to their <br/>
needs, and give them all that they need, we are able to have that <br/>
extra time to ourselves.  It is about trying to anticipate their <br/>
needs first and trying to meet them, before you reach a crisis, <br/>
where everyone is upset.  This is true in all relationships if you <br/>
really think about it.  If I ignore my husband for days on end, he <br/>
is bound to act like a jerk.  Same goes for your best friend, your <br/>
other loved ones, and your children.<br/>
OK.  writing this helped me probably more than anything. I welcome <br/>
your comments and thanks again for letting me be a part of this <br/>
group.<br/>
