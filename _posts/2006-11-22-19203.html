<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184576684">Hi all, I just heard that there&#39;s a great Consensual Living discussion<br/>
going on here, and I&#39;d love to lurk (and participate if my sit-down<br/>
time allows).  My name is Angie, and we grew/transitioned quite<br/>
naturally toward whole-life unschooling from the foundations of<br/>
Attachment Parenting.  My two daughters, Prairie (3.75yo) and Karina<br/>
(22mo), both nurse and co-sleep, and live and learn naturally in South<br/>
Dakota, with me as partner/playmate/facilitator/cook/bath tub<br/>
filler-upper/and not-so-successful-housekeeper.  As a sidenote to &quot;the<br/>
facts&quot; of my intro, I am wondering if my growing &quot;dependence&quot; on these<br/>
great lists is heading toward &quot;addiction&quot; LOL!  &lt;kidding&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Pat for the Heads-Up on AlwaysUnschooled, to all of you<br/>
dedicated unschoolers who make time to keep lists running smoothly,<br/>
and to all the newbies who bring up an enormity of great discussion<br/>
points that keep us all growing toward respectful family dynamics.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Angie</div>
