I think you have to ask yourself the purpose behind the Suzuki<br/>
lessons. If he&#39;s truly learning for the sheer joy of the instrument,<br/>
he really doesn&#39;t need any lessons yet at all. If he truly wants the<br/>
lessons, let him take from it exactly what he chooses. Being pushed to<br/>
practice kills all joy of playing...trust me (as a child that was<br/>
prodded too much and learned to resent lessons and playing of any kind).<br/>
<br/>
I really am not a big fan of Suzuki unless a child is driven and wants<br/>
it. Suzuki&#39;s goal seems to be turning out virtuosos. My goal as a<br/>
parent is to help my children pursue things for the sheer joy of the<br/>
activity.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
Not that I have an answer for you but have you read John Holt&#39;s<br/>
Learning All the Time? He has a very good chapter about Suzuki Violin.<br/>
My daughter takes piano and she practices when she wants to. I<br/>
sometimes ask her if she would like to practice and she says yes or<br/>
no. If it is to be &quot;her&quot; lessons then she is going to get out of if<br/>
what she needs and wants, not what I need or want. If you would like<br/>
your child to have a love of music than it has to come from their<br/>
desire (not what John Holt says just my opinion.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570896788">I was about 8 when I became really frustrated with piano.  My mother <br/>
did not push me to practice in any way, but did not help either.  One <br/>
day I sat at the piano crying in frustration because there was <br/>
something I did not understand.  My mother said to me, &quot;I have a <br/>
suggestion. Quit.&quot;  So I did.  I didn&#39;t pick up the piano again until <br/>
I was twelve.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad that my mom was not a pusher (oh, that didn&#39;t come out right <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;), but at the same time I wish she would have taken more <br/>
interest in _helping_ me through that frustrating time when I was <br/>
eight.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of thinking that your son should be practicing more, think of <br/>
how you can help him.  The big question though is what does help look <br/>
like.  For me, it would been extremely helpful if my mom was just <br/>
present in the room with me.  Not sitting on the piano bench or <br/>
asking me a bunch of questions, but just being there.  The other <br/>
thing that would have helped is if she became familiar herself with <br/>
the instrument and kept a dialogue with the teacher.  My mom just <br/>
sent me down the street to the teacher&#39;s house and never spoke to <br/>
her.  As it turns out, when I quit it was over a simple <br/>
misunderstanding about finger placement.  It would have been such a <br/>
simple thing to clear up the confusion I had.<br/>
<br/>
In your son&#39;s case, help may look like doing nothing.  It could look <br/>
like getting some piano CDs and listening to them for your <br/>
enjoyment.  It most certainly will include knowing what the teacher <br/>
is doing in his lessons.  You don&#39;t have to have a discussion every <br/>
week with your son (that could just be annoying for him), but if you <br/>
are familiar with the nuances of the teacher&#39;s interaction with your <br/>
son, it may give you a better idea of what help looks like.<br/>
<br/>
I will say, if my mom even once, had asked me if I had practiced that <br/>
day, there is a big chance that I would have never returned to the <br/>
piano at twelve.  IMO, it is actually better that he never ever <br/>
practices than asking him to practice.  To this day, I totally own <br/>
the work I have done in piano.  I never credit my mother for making <br/>
me practice.  I credit only myself and my love for the instrument.  I <br/>
still play and still practice and still dream of playing even <br/>
better.  It&#39;s a life long passion for sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591430452">I am new to unschooling but have been doing the suzuki violin and <br/>
cello with both of my girls since they were about 5.  my oldest <br/>
started because she wanted to and wouldn&#39;t stop bugging us.  To be <br/>
honest my youngest I think started becasue big sister was fun to <br/>
watch and because mom and dad helped her, so there for,she also <br/>
started for attention purposes.  But having been through the &#39;I don&#39;t <br/>
want to practice,&#39; to &#39;I love to practice and play in front of <br/>
people,&#39; a little advice I would give is to relax. Do group lessons <br/>
(my girls both love these more than lesson day).  And go to suzuki <br/>
camp.  At camp they meet other kids and play all these silly games <br/>
that you can go home and do. When my girls come home from suzuki camp <br/>
they are so excited to play and often go for an hour or more playing <br/>
and listening to their peices even just making up some music on their <br/>
own.  Find a teacher that is fun and plays games with them.  This is <br/>
as important as posture a teacher that is not fun will kill any <br/>
interest in any thing (just like school).  Attend the lessons every <br/>
week.  There are books that are for suzuki teachers that have games <br/>
and such for each song they play.  Try to find one.  And don&#39;t be <br/>
disapointed if they don&#39;t want to play and want to quit.  Maybe they <br/>
just wanted to see if they could do it and now that he proved he <br/>
could he wants to try something else.  The only way to see if you <br/>
like something is to try it, give it a good shot and sometimes you <br/>
like it sometimes you don&#39;t.  Just make sure that he know no matter <br/>
what you love him and support his decision.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608940272">As a follow up to the speech disfluency email, I have a related concern <br/>
that I was interested in getting some input on. My son, age 14, who has <br/>
had the sudden re-occurrence of stuttering, has been for the first time <br/>
in his life teased about it- kids at his summer job are imitating him <br/>
and calling attention to his stutter. He has asked them to stop and they <br/>
have not. He is considering saying something to the supervisor about it- <br/>
this is happening when he is not is the room. One kid took his name tag <br/>
and threw it down a hole in an exhibit(he works at a science center), <br/>
another threw things at his face repeatedly. Unless the supervisor is a <br/>
skilled communicator, I fear that his intervention is likely to worsen <br/>
the situation. Fortunately this is only a six week position and he is <br/>
half way through, so finishing it gracefully is not seeming impossible, <br/>
though I would support him in whatever he feels he needs to do.<br/>
<br/>
So this is the toughening up that kids are supposed to receive when they <br/>
go to school? These are all schooled kids he is working with. I feel so <br/>
sad that kids endure this day after day.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on effective things one could say or do in this kind of <br/>
situation? He did experience something similar at an afterschool program <br/>
but there we were able to quickly find a substitute of a similar <br/>
activity with only homeschooled kids. He was much younger then and I <br/>
spoke directly with the leader of that program, who listened and <br/>
admitted that they needed to supervise the kids more closely. I am <br/>
pretty sure at the age he is now that having me get involved directly is <br/>
NOT what he wants- though certainly I am here to listen, support, and <br/>
make suggestions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671839851">My kids both take music lessons(ages 10 and 14). They did both start <br/>
playing an instrument without lessons and then both requested lessons.  <br/>
May son started at 11, and my daughter started a couple of months ago. <br/>
Since &quot;improvement&quot; comes both during breaks from playing and with <br/>
playing, and the patterns of amounts of playing ebb and flow, it has <br/>
worked best for us not to request that they practice. Sometimes they <br/>
request that I remind them to practice.  Mostly they just pick up the <br/>
instrument and play- sometimes for 5 minutes, sometimes all day. There <br/>
was an article in Life Learning Magazine that discussed this topic, and <br/>
suggested that parents not refer to the playing as practice- as the <br/>
playing that is done as &quot;practice&quot; is done for enjoyment, and not in <br/>
preparation for something else.<br/>
<br/>
Dana&#39;s point about helping the child is a good one. I help my children <br/>
frequently as they request, often by listening, sometimes suggesting <br/>
something if they are open to a suggestion - such as using a metronome, <br/>
or finding a recording of the piece, maybe reminding them of something a <br/>
teacher has suggested. This is only is they are open to it and have <br/>
invited participation. It may be talking to a teacher about an issue, <br/>
attending a lesson with them, getting the instrument repaired, or <br/>
improved,  offering opportunities to play in groups. When my son(14) has <br/>
made a commitment to playing with a group, he will want help organizing <br/>
his day so that there is enough time to prepare for that. He will leave <br/>
a note asking me to wake him up in enough time before work so he can <br/>
play scales. If it is getting late in the day and we are all planning to <br/>
go to bed soon(our house is small), I will ask him if he wants to play <br/>
before the time at which we request that things quiet down so that Dad <br/>
can get enough sleep before going to work(he is a carpenter and needs <br/>
especially to be alert). He usually does want to play, and the reminder <br/>
is only to help him avoid the frustration of wanting to play and not <br/>
having enough time to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I do help my son quite a bit with planning his time, when he requests, <br/>
or I offer when he seems to be getting frustrated- we sit down together <br/>
and make a schedule. I guess I could just let him experience the <br/>
consequences of his own forgetfulness, but this seems a little cruel. He <br/>
tends to take on quite a bit at times, with rehearsals, work etc.<br/>

  I&#39;m sorry he&#39;s having to deal with this.  Sure, it&#39;s only 6 weeks, but that&#39;s still 6 weeks too long to be mistreated by anyone.  <br/>
   <br/>

<br/>
  ******<br/>
  yep -- mainstream folks call it &quot;kids can be so cruel&quot;  and say it&#39;s just something kids should ignore or to get over it.  Really, it&#39;s the way any inmate group will behave, and kids in school are nothing more than inmates with very poor supervision and no real power, except to hurt each other.  <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
Any suggestions on effective things one could say or do in this kind of situation? <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  Given his age, I wouldn&#39;t recommend getting involved yourself unless he asks you to.  He could try talking to the supervisor if he feels comfortable doing so, and if he&#39;s willing to risk that talking to the boss might only anger the other kids, leading to more abuse. It&#39;s hard to say what will really happen.  How much authority does the supervisor have to stop the teasing?  Is there a process in place with the museum&#39;s management to deal with such situations?  Are these kids he&#39;ll run into again and have to deal with to pursue his own dreams?  What would he consider progress, and how much genuine progress can be realistically expected given the real limits of how difficult it is to control employees/interns? <br/>
   <br/>
  At a minimum, if he just chooses to tough it out now and not say anything to his boss, I&#39;d encourage him to write up a letter about the teasing he encountered and submitting that to whatever powers that be at the museum.  It may not help him in this situation, but could prevent others from being teased the same way, if the museum realizes there&#39;s a problem in the program and the way the students involved conduct themselves.<br/>

Talking to the supervisor is a little like tattling and they are <br/>
more likely to make it worse for your son.It may help you be able to <br/>
deal with it if you imagine what and adult should do in this <br/>
situation. I would have your son if he is capable of it talk to the <br/>
supervisor not trying to get them to stop but expalining that it is <br/>
really difficult to work by them and if he could be moved to a <br/>
different dept. Also I would ask him if he would like to quit and <br/>
either you or he lets the supervisor know why he is quiting.<br/>
