<div id="ygrps-yiv-940647940">Hi Everyone,<br/>
My name is Kim.  I have 3 daughters ages 9, 11, and 12.  We have always homeschooled but I recently decided to take the plunge and just toss the curriculum.  I think we will all be happier in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to learning from you all as well as offering any wisdom or insight that I might have that could prove helpful to you.<br/>
<br/>
Slan!<br/>
