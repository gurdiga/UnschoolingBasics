<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340991814">Ok, so I&#39;m not feeling well today - came home from work with bad sinus<br/>
infection. I&#39;m resting on the couch just trying to ease the pain away.<br/>
DH took the older two to the movies and my 3yr old stayed with me. He<br/>
got his own snack of crackers and cheese and decided to pour all the<br/>
crackers into one tiny bag and asked me to close the bag. (you know<br/>
the party cracker packs with 4-5 varieties?) Not being in a very<br/>
positive mood, I grumbled something to the effect that he should have<br/>
left the others closed up (he opened all the packages, even the ones<br/>
he doesn&#39;t like). I told him to get one more bag and put some in the<br/>
new bag. 5 minutes later, he comes to me with 5 ziploz bags filled<br/>
with crackers, all separated by variety, telling me that he put the<br/>
circles in this bag, brown sqare ones in here, an so on... I just had<br/>
to laugh and hug him... left to his own, he came up wth his own<br/>
solution and did so with much more creativity than I would have<br/>
anticipated from him at that moment...<br/>
<br/>
About 10 minutes later, the kids came home and he excitedly met them<br/>
at the door explaining what he did all by himself - mind you I didn&#39;t<br/>
talk to him about it at all.<br/>
<br/>
just had to share.<br/>
