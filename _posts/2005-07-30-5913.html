<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005204851">Hi Sharon. I am in Prince George, not on the Island, but there is a yahoo <br/>
group called BCUnschoolers that I belong to , you might be able to hook up with <br/>
someone near you, as there are a bunch on Vancouver Island. AS far as <br/>
provincial regs, the BC government site has a the regs posted under I believe Ministry <br/>
of Education. <br/>
Good Luck<br/>
