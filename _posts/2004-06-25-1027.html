I love  nagging questions - for me they are always an area of personal  growth<br/>
waiting to happen.<br/>
<br/>
It is astonishing to me that anyone would  want to include coercion as one of<br/>
the tools for getting children to learn  specific things, or more accurately<br/>
*appear* to learn things by completing  a certain amount of schoolwork. Yet<br/>
it happens all the time in schooling  situations. I would consider it as the<br/>
opposite of unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Or  are you meaning coercion relative to other behavior/areas of life than<br/>
the  &quot;educational component&quot; of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Coercion comes from an absence  of trust. If a person feels like they have to<br/>
use coercion to achieve some  goals about their child&#39;s behavior or activity,<br/>
and say so here, they are  likely to be invited to rethink those goals, the<br/>
assumptions behind the  goals, as well as offered alternative strategies that<br/>
are more in keeping  with one of the most fundamental principles of<br/>
Unschooling - trusting in  our children and promoting their trust in us.<br/>
<br/>
So now some  musings:<br/>
<br/>
People seem to come to &quot;whole life&quot; Unschooling from two  directions. Many<br/>
will say in their introductions that Unschooling seemed a  natural<br/>
progression from attachment parenting and the gamut of gentle child  rearing<br/>
practices. That is how we came to it. We already had complete  freedom around<br/>
food (I didn&#39;t make candy available to my infant btw, but  she sure liked<br/>
apple sauce), encouraged computer use, had no bedtime (she  just went with<br/>
us), allowed potty learning to just happen, and had made an  inviolable<br/>
commitment to not spanking or punishing - including imposed  &quot;consequences&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Honesty compels me to admit that TV freedom I wondered  about having read<br/>
some of those goofy studies done about brain development.  It was causing me<br/>
a crisis of integrity because I love the television - not  every show on it -<br/>
and wanted to be free to watch it. It is very ironic  that Jayn is the one<br/>
wanting it turned off, and I get to watch way less as  she gets older!<br/>
<br/>
I was very happy to find Unschooling, having already  concluded that we would<br/>
be really, really, really relaxed homeschoolers. It  meant that we could live<br/>
Jayn&#39;s education process in the same way as the  rest of our life -<br/>
seamlessly. For me and dh the non-coercion came first,  and the journey has<br/>
been about recognizing/stopping if we use manipulation,  and finding better<br/>
strategies for problem solving - identifying and  elucidating the Principles<br/>
instead of Rules (not that we had any - rules  that is), chucking away the<br/>
baggage of our childhoods and educations  instead of constantly opening the<br/>
bags and getting stuff out of them to  use. Generally just trying to better<br/>
grasp what Jayn is communicating and  meet those needs.<br/>
<br/>
Other people come to Unschooling from another  educational system, living a<br/>
life accustomed to regular household rules,  and start their journey to<br/>
freedom with trusting children to learn whatever  they like. Slowly they<br/>
renounce schoolish language and thinking (which is  often inherently<br/>
coercive) and start to see their children blossom  again.<br/>
<br/>
Then it often spreads like osmosis to other areas of life,  gradually as the<br/>
comfort level of each family is challenged. Sometimes  people post the same<br/>
kind of astounded rush of relief and release of the  pressure about &quot;we have<br/>
let go of XXXX restrictions and we are all so much  happier&quot;, as they did<br/>
when they first pulled their kid out of public or  private school - &quot;I only<br/>
wish we had done it sooner&quot; is the number one  sentiment expressed on line.<br/>
<br/>
Probably no one on this kind of list wants  to be thought of as using<br/>
coercion. They use other language from the  parenting arsenal like &quot;sensible<br/>
limits&quot; or &quot;concern for their safety&quot; or  &quot;all living together comfortably&quot;.<br/>
It is only by talking about people&#39;s  actual practices, what they *do* and<br/>
say to their children in any situation  that the full range of what these<br/>
phrases really mean comes out.  <br/>
<br/>
One person&#39;s &quot;sensible limits&quot; means that they don&#39;t leave power  tools<br/>
unattended with a 2 year old and take time to explain that these  are<br/>
dangerous - perhaps they help them examine all the buttons with the  plug out<br/>
and show them what the plug looks like. They get them some play  tools and<br/>
safety goggles. They let them bang a mallet on some spare wood.  When they<br/>
see their child heading for the workshop door, they go with them  or make an<br/>
appointment to do some more banging after  lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Another&#39;s means that they forbid their 2 year old to enter the  workshop,<br/>
explaining seriously but kindly that it is dangerous in there,  then grab the<br/>
kid and make them stand in a time out corner if they have  gone into the<br/>
enticingly mysterious doorway. I have read on line mothers  actually<br/>
believing that their children (of various ages) spend their time  outs<br/>
carefully contemplating the crime they committed for which they are  being<br/>
punished/given consequences. I&#39;m dubious (based on my recollections  of my<br/>
childhood) that they are making an entirely accurate prediction of  their<br/>
kids&#39; thoughts at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the phrase &quot;all living  together comfortably&quot;, and its close cousin<br/>
&quot;they live here too&quot;, have the  unspoken assumption that what is comfortable<br/>
for the parents is either  commensurate with, or takes precedence over, what<br/>
is comfortable for the  child. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;No coercion whatsoever&quot; is a marvelous goal to have, a true  gift to your<br/>
children.<br/>
