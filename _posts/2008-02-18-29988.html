<div id="ygrps-yiv-69609737">Hi! My name is Tara, wife to Justin for 5.5 years and mom to 8 yr old son, Z. Z went to a private school for 2.5 years before we finally woke up and took him out. He&#39;s been out for over a year now and we have no intentions of looking back!<br/>
<br/>
My friend (SwissArmyWife) gave me the link to this group and I must admit even after unschooling for a year now, within hours of reading thru some of these posts, I was amazed at the awesome info I picked up (esp stuf I thought I already knew)! I&#39;m looking forward to absorbing more!<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s my question that I&#39;m hoping some veterans can give me some insight on:<br/>
<br/>
My son dyed his hair a rockin&#39; shade of (almost neon) blue. He really loved it for about 24 hours. Most people we hang around are unschoolers who would all say &quot;Cool hair!&quot; and get on with what they were doing (and others that didn&#39;t know us didn&#39;t say anything). <br/>
<br/>
But family members are a different story. We went out to eat with my parents who could not stop teasing him about his hair! (Dang those public school people! lol) Now he&#39;s always trying to hide his hair and is very insecure about it (it is semi-permenant dye so it&#39;s not going anywhere soon either). I&#39;m a bit annoyed (with my parents) that my once excited son is now shy about his awesome hair.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to handle this with people, especially parents. Is this just a natural side effect of such cool hair that I should allow him to learn from or should I step in and say &quot;Zip it already&quot;? Or should I only step in at a certain point and what is that point? I feel like I should have handled the whole situation differently but am not really sure how. (I always seem to botch my response when it comes to my parents.)<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408977913">Hi Tara, I just want to say welcome to this group!  We&#39;ve only be unschooling a short time, we have 3 year old twin girls.  For the record, I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re not the only one who botches responses to your parents &lt;g&gt;.  I don&#39;t have one iota of advice, so I&#39;m going to shut up and listen along with you for the wise ones to come by.<br/>

<br/>
But family members are a different story. We went out to eat with my <br/>
parents who<br/>
could not stop teasing him about his hair! (Dang those public school <br/>
people!<br/>
lol) Now he&#39;s always trying to hide his hair and is very insecure about <br/>
it (it<br/>
is semi-permenant dye so it&#39;s not going anywhere soon either). I&#39;m a <br/>
bit annoyed<br/>
(with my parents) that my once excited son is now shy about his awesome <br/>
hair.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would be more than annoyed. BUT---he needs to be able to trust *you*, <br/>
his mom, to step in and intervene on his behalf.<br/>
<br/>
If you won&#39;t do it, who will? Certainly not these grandparents who are <br/>
contributing to his discomfort.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would tell my parents that, until they could play nicely with <br/>
a *child*, they wouldn&#39;t be allowed to play at all. Such teasing is NOT <br/>
play.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to handle this with people, especially parents. Is <br/>
this just a<br/>
natural side effect of such cool hair that I should allow him to learn <br/>
from or<br/>
should I step in and say &quot;Zip it already&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How would you have wanted it to be handled when you were that age? Have <br/>
you asked your son how he wishes it had been handled?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Or should I only step in at a certain<br/>
point and what is that point? I feel like I should have handled the <br/>
whole<br/>
situation differently but am not really sure how. (I always seem to <br/>
botch my<br/>
response when it comes to my parents.)<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d ask why they thought that was necessary. My answer would depend on <br/>
their reactions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-513168503">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group. I haven&#39;t started unschooling yet... in a couple of<br/>
weeks my 8 yo daughter will finish term 1 (Australian) at school so we plan<br/>
to start then. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I read about unschooling my heart goes &#39;yes yes yes&#39; but when I<br/>
actually start to think about what our days will look like when she quits<br/>
school, my brain is kicking into anxious mode. &quot;We&#39;ll have to do this... we<br/>
could try that... how will I get her to...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a really big challenge to me to let go and let it all happen.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One question I have is: do unschooled children learn to be perseverative and<br/>
persistent even on things they don&#39;t particularly enjoy at the time, if they<br/>
are convinced by the gain once through the pain, so to speak? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And why am I so terrified to let her stop piano lessons? (Actually, I know<br/>
the answer to that and it is that I&#39;m worried about my mother&#39;s reaction!<br/>
Hmmm, work to do there...) She&#39;s recently lost her interest after being<br/>
really keen last year. Is it just a faze? Will she pick it up again later?<br/>
Should I continue the lessons but leave the practice up to her? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Look, basically, are you sure it works? What kind of kid will she turn out<br/>
to be????<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the honest comments!<br/>
<br/>
Cecily<br/>

young.  I don&#39;t know what kind of relationship you had/have with them <br/>
but is it likely there is an element of fear involved?  Maybe fear of <br/>
disapproval?  If this situation had occurred in my family, I would <br/>
know that my mom and stepdad were teasing my child in good fun.  They <br/>
are like that actually.  However, I have to step in many times and <br/>
remind my mother that her perceptions are very different from her <br/>
grandchildren&#39;s perceptions.  Such teasing might be fine if both <br/>
parties understood it wasn&#39;t serious and everyone laughed and felt <br/>
good about it.  But if the adult&#39;s teasing caused the child to feel <br/>
bad, then it is no longer good natured teasing.  My mom truly didn&#39;t <br/>
understand that at first but she did finally get it.<br/>

<br/>
Put it this way, if you were made to stick with 10 things you weren&#39;t  <br/>
enjoying and one turned out okay, what are the chances that you&#39;d  <br/>
decide as an adult that sticking with something unpleasant was worth it?<br/>
<br/>
What if you were allowed to quit whenever you wanted and built up  <br/>
over time a sense of accomplishment with completed tasks, some of  <br/>
which had some difficulties that you chose to push past?<br/>
<br/>
I think adults either picture or from experience, remember the times  <br/>
they were forced to do something and ended up loving it. That then  <br/>
colors their perception of the advantages of someone pushing someone  <br/>
else to do something. They *don&#39;t* remember the far more numerous  <br/>
times they were made to do something, hated it, and then avoided  <br/>
anything else to do with it.<br/>

Great advise from Kelly on handling the rents...I&#39;ll add spend time <br/>
working with DS on feeling good about himself and his groovy hair...you <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you asked your son how he wishes it had been handled?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is where I struggle sometimes. I was a pretty exuberant, <br/>
colorful kid. My son and I have very different personalities at times <br/>
and when I think back to being a kid, my reaction would have been to <br/>
laugh or play along in fun and enjoy the reactions of others. Z <br/>
doesn&#39;t do this but he also doesn&#39;t always let on something is <br/>
bothering him. At the time he was playing his DS and I didn&#39;t realize <br/>
how it affected him until the next day when he kept trying to hide <br/>
his hair and I asked him why. <br/>
<br/>
I talked to him about it last night and he seemed not to remember his <br/>
grandparents teasing (maybe he didn&#39;t see it as teasing?) but he said <br/>
he didn&#39;t realize how much people would want to talk about his hair <br/>
and that&#39;s why he kept it covered (he&#39;s been wearing a hood and <br/>
taking it off a little at a time to see how the people around him <br/>
will react). He said he still likes his hair but he just doesn&#39;t like <br/>
people constantly talking about it.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about the options; shaving his head, being proud, keeping a <br/>
hat on. I tried to explain why I thought people wanted to talk about <br/>
it so much (because it&#39;s cool/shocking/interesting etc). I guess I&#39;ll <br/>
have to wait and see how he he handles it at the store today to see <br/>
if he&#39;s anymore comfortable with it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; disapproval?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always had a good relationship with them, but their parenting is <br/>
much different then ours. Although they completely support us <br/>
unschooling, they still don&#39;t get the &quot;radical&quot; (parenting) part of <br/>
it. My bonus(step) dad especially has a hard time. He believes in <br/>
being very &quot;stern&quot; (i.e. controlling) with kids. I&#39;m usually very <br/>
outspoken with them (with all of my family really - I&#39;m the loud one <br/>
that calls people out on stuff). There is an element of fear there <br/>
but I think my fear is not so much their reaction but just a general <br/>
wanting to avoid a our style vs. your style debate ...partially <br/>
because I&#39;m getting a reputation for being too &quot;opinionated&quot;. LOL I <br/>
also just don&#39;t like having to defend myself constantly so I avoid <br/>
the conversation and we respectfully agree to disagree.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If this situation had occurred in my family, I would <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; know that my mom and stepdad were teasing my child in good fun.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I certainly knew they were playing but I didn&#39;t realize my son <br/>
didn&#39;t. I guess maybe he&#39;s an internalizer? He mulls things over <br/>
(sometimes for days) before talking about them. Maybe I need to see <br/>
if he wants to come up with a system or a signal that means &quot;save <br/>
me&quot;. Or I just need to discreetly check in more often.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858990012">I would step in for teasing. That&#39;s just not nice and, if you feel <br/>
uncomfortable confronting your parents, imagine how your ds must <br/>
feel about confronting his grandparents. I&#39;ve had to ask my dad to <br/>
not tease my children. He teased me a lot when I was a child and a <br/>
lot of it hurt even though I knew his intentions were not to be mean <br/>
and hurt me. I just told my dad that my children&#39;s feelings were <br/>
hurt by the teasing. Luckily, my dad understands that&#39;s not good <br/>
rather than thinking they need to be toughened up like some might so <br/>
he was glad I told him and he stopped. If I had gotten another <br/>
reaction, I would&#39;ve then told him he couldn&#39;t be around my kids <br/>
until he could be nice to them.<br/>

Heck, I know adults that went to school who don&#39;t do that if someone&#39;s<br/>
not holding their feet to the fire, so to speak. But, yes, PEOPLE learn<br/>
to persevere through difficult stuff IF it&#39;s toward a goal they have<br/>
*chosen* - doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re adults or kids. The common schooled<br/>
kid plaint of &quot;Do I haaave to?&quot; and &quot;Why do I have to learn this stuff?&quot;<br/>
goes away when they&#39;re unschooling because no, they don&#39;t necessarily<br/>
&quot;have to&quot; (barring the odd critical illness or something) and they learn<br/>
things when/as they are ready and it has a connection, a meaning, for<br/>
them. It&#39;s not about required grade level subject data but about<br/>
following a life path. Whether it&#39;s perfecting a martial arts kata or<br/>
finishing a tough level of a videogame, yes it happens. For that matter,<br/>
people learn about persevering from toddlerhood - ever watch a little<br/>
one learn to walk? That&#39;s *hard work*, lots of falling, bumps and<br/>
scrapes, BUT tots have a goal - to figure out how to use these &quot;legs&quot;<br/>
and &quot;feet&quot; to move around like Mom and Dad and other &#39;big people&#39;. We go<br/>
ahead and make sure they&#39;ve got a safe space to work in, provide a hand<br/>
when requested and let go when it&#39;s obvious they want us to let go &quot;No,<br/>
I do it!&quot; lol Hugs and cuddles for the bumps. Same applies - our task is<br/>
to facilitate, make space, time, resources available, assistance as<br/>
requested, let go as needed, and provide a safe haven for the bumps and<br/>
bruises of life.<br/>
<br/>
As to the piano lessons, have you *asked* your daughter what she wants<br/>
to do? Just lesson? Just play on her own? Different teacher? lots of<br/>
options<br/>
<br/>
What kind of kid will she turn out to be? We have no idea ... and<br/>
neither do you ... and unschooling won&#39;t change that. What it will do,<br/>
though, is free her to become Who She Is, whatever that ends up looking<br/>
like rather than confining her and &quot;molding&quot; her into what others want.<br/>
She (and all people) are not blobs of blank clay to be molded into the<br/>
image someone else desires. Right from the get-go each person is unique<br/>
and wonderful. Schools are designed to mass produce a bunch of pretty<br/>
much the same &quot;objects&quot; but free from school, each person is free to<br/>
become a one of a kind designer original.<br/>

they<br/>

<br/>
Cameron&#39;s done LOTS of less pleasant things in order to achieve <br/>
something important at the end.<br/>

She&#39;s not your mother or your mother&#39;s child. And although you *are* <br/>
your mother&#39;s child, you are *ALSO*---and more importantly---an adult <br/>
AND a parent. It&#39;s time to BE the adult and the parent. Your mother had <br/>
her turn at being the parent. If she&#39;s happy with the job she did, she <br/>
should have no problem trusting your decisions. If she&#39;s NOT pleased <br/>
with the job she did, ...well...maybe she should back off and let you <br/>
try something new.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 She&#39;s recently lost her interest after being<br/>
really keen last year. Is it just a faze?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Maybe. Would you be disappointed if it&#39;s not?<br/>

How can you force someone to love the piano?<br/>

Cameron plays drums and sometimes seems obsessed with them and other <br/>
times dismissive. He sometimes asks for lessons and other times tells <br/>
Danny (the teacher) that he needs a break. Sometimes he plays until is <br/>
hands ache; other days he doesn&#39;t even go out to the music room.<br/>
<br/>
He always seems to be getting better, not worse. In fact, often after <br/>
the break, his skills have improved *magically*.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404926411">My two oldest boys (14 & 11) have in the past month had bright purple,<br/>
pink and blue hair (not at once lol).  They experienced a bit of good<br/>
natured teasing about it and actually seemed to quite enjoy the<br/>
attention.  They were aware that if they made the choice to dye their<br/>
hair an outrageous colour, they would naturally receive some either<br/>
wanted or unwanted attention as a natural consequence, and it really<br/>
didn&#39;t bother them.  If it had been done in a cruel way I would<br/>
probably have tried to make some light hearted comment on their behalf<br/>
if I&#39;d noticed them struggling to cope.  It&#39;s &quot;just hair&quot; after all! <br/>

&gt; &gt; What do you all think?<br/>

&gt; I think you are still looking at your parents as if you were very <br/>
&gt; young.  I don&#39;t know what kind of relationship you had/have with them <br/>
&gt; but is it likely there is an element of fear involved?  Maybe fear of <br/>
&gt; disapproval?  If this situation had occurred in my family, I would <br/>
&gt; know that my mom and stepdad were teasing my child in good fun.  They <br/>
&gt; are like that actually.  However, I have to step in many times and <br/>
&gt; remind my mother that her perceptions are very different from her <br/>
&gt; grandchildren&#39;s perceptions.  Such teasing might be fine if both <br/>
&gt; parties understood it wasn&#39;t serious and everyone laughed and felt <br/>
&gt; good about it.  But if the adult&#39;s teasing caused the child to feel <br/>
&gt; bad, then it is no longer good natured teasing.  My mom truly didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; understand that at first but she did finally get it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698776893">My WeightWatchers leader suggested that we go home and make a list of  <br/>
100 things we&#39;ve accomplished in our life. I won&#39;t go into the reason  <br/>
for doing that, but I mentioned it to my 17 year old, and that started  <br/>
a conversation between us about the things she felt good about having  <br/>
accomplished in her life. Some of the things she listed:<br/>
<br/>
- starting karate training<br/>
- getting her brown belt<br/>
- getting her black belt<br/>
- auditioning for a dance concert<br/>
- learning to do certain really difficult dance steps<br/>
- earning her Girl Scout Bronze award and Silver award<br/>
- getting her Girl Scout Gold award project approved<br/>
- writing two NaNoWriMo novels<br/>
- writing a screenplay<br/>
- writing 30,000 words in one day<br/>
<br/>
What I noticed about her list was that starting karate training and  <br/>
auditioning for the dance concert required her to step outside her  <br/>
comfort zone, but all the rest of them required a great deal of  <br/>
perseverance and, yes, working through discomfort and sometimes  <br/>
outright pain.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-12936746">I have enjoyed reading this post.  I was just about to post a question about piano lessons and practice.  Found myself these days pushing Lukas to practice with all kinds of great wisdoms around what practice can do for him.  Now I am wondering if my pushing is just something I need....probably is...I was going to ask what others do around piano practice.  He loves the piano, doesn&#39;t want to stop lessons but clearly isn&#39;t in a space to practice like he was a number of weeks ago.  I think I got my answer...but thought I would look for some more feedback.  We are certainly moving along in our deschooling process and I feel my concerns and panic are lessening though I do have these questions that linger when what I am doing just isn&#39;t working.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-78313045">Thank you! I appreciate that list and the answers from everyone else too. <br/>
<br/>
After meeting some of the local homeschoolers today, I feel even more at<br/>
ease!<br/>

Cheers, Cecily<br/>

<br/>
My WeightWatchers leader suggested that we go home and make a list of <br/>
100 things we&#39;ve accomplished in our life. I won&#39;t go into the reason <br/>
for doing that, but I mentioned it to my 17 year old, and that started <br/>
a conversation between us about the things she felt good about having <br/>
accomplished in her life. Some of the things she listed:<br/>
<br/>
- starting karate training<br/>
- getting her brown belt<br/>
- getting her black belt<br/>
- auditioning for a dance concert<br/>
- learning to do certain really difficult dance steps<br/>
- earning her Girl Scout Bronze award and Silver award<br/>
- getting her Girl Scout Gold award project approved<br/>
- writing two NaNoWriMo novels<br/>
- writing a screenplay<br/>
- writing 30,000 words in one day<br/>
<br/>
What I noticed about her list was that starting karate training and <br/>
auditioning for the dance concert required her to step outside her <br/>
comfort zone, but all the rest of them required a great deal of <br/>
perseverance and, yes, working through discomfort and sometimes <br/>
outright pain.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; do unschooled children learn to be perseverative and<br/>
&gt; &gt; persistent even on things they don&#39;t particularly enjoy at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; time, if they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are convinced by the gain once through the pain, so to speak?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL - I well remember those days. Rosie watched &quot;Arthur&quot; - hours and  <br/>
hours of Arthur. And - we supported that interest strongly by playing  <br/>
Arthur with her, getting her all the little Arthur books, getting the  <br/>
Arthur dolls, getting her an Arthur lunchbox to carry around some of  <br/>
her books. I found the author&#39;s website and we found games and  <br/>
coloring pages and Target carried Arthur activity books. There was  <br/>
even a phone number you could call and hear a &quot;message&quot; from the  <br/>
author in which he talked about the book he was currently writing. On  <br/>
and on...we lived and breathed Arthur.<br/>
<br/>
The other day she put some music from an Arthur episode on a cd mix  <br/>
she was making for her karate studio. As she was playing it, she said,  <br/>
to her dad, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s Art Garfunkel singing - you like him, right?&quot;  <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Providing STRONG support for whatever the child&#39;s interest is - Blues  <br/>
Clues or Arthur or karate or dance or making potions out of leaves and  <br/>
dirt or climbing walls or drawing cartoons or whatever - is the key to  <br/>
happy and productive unschooling! I&#39;ve told stories before about  <br/>
supporting my middle daughter&#39;s interest in CATS, the musical. Let&#39;s  <br/>
just say we saw that show live about 10 times, in full costume and  <br/>
makeup, driving hours to get to a where it was being performed. We  <br/>
watched the video maybe hundreds of times. And much much more. It led  <br/>
to so many other interests, led us down so many paths I could never  <br/>
have imagined. That daughter is now in France, living there for 3  <br/>
months, studying history, films, and creative writing, and spending  <br/>
every spare minute at museums, shows, historic sites. I can look back  <br/>
and see how supporting CATS paved the way for the her to be where she  <br/>
is now.<br/>
<br/>
Eve though you can&#39;t predict the future, the best preparation for a  <br/>
rich and wonderful future life is - tadaa - living a rich and  <br/>
wonderful present life!<br/>
