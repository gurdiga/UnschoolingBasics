<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583816321">Hello. My name is Laura and I have been homeschooling my 8 1/2 yo dd all of her life.<br/>
<br/>
I have never bought a formal curriculum and have always just used resources that I find via the net. I have always structured our schooling to be like a school room atmosphere....the desk, charts, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Until recently she never minded. Lately, we have both been not &#39;feelin the love&quot; with the way I have been &quot;teaching&quot; her.<br/>
<br/>
I have always toyed with the idea of unschooling, but no matter how much I read my insecurites would seep back in and I would start &quot;teaching&quot; her again.<br/>
<br/>
With her being an only child we are able to go and do alot of things...museums, hiking, zoos, etc. She is very worldly in the fact that we have always gone and done alot of stuff so she is very &quot;socialized&quot; and aware of everyday things that most kids aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest concern with unschooling is how do kids learn their multiplication tables, parts of speech, etc. The sort of stuff that you actually have to memorize and learn? Am I just suppose to let her do anything she wants all day in hopes that she finds something constructive to do??<br/>
<br/>
I know for a fact that if I totally left it up to her there would no academics involved at all. She hates math and really doesn&#39;t enjoy reading even though she reads at her grade level or above. She couldn&#39;t care less about history no matter how it is presented to her.<br/>
<br/>
I need insight and encouragement from someone who has been there and did that.  I don&#39;t want &quot;school&quot; to be a battle everyday like it has been the past year. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
Laura</div>

Plus, someone just posted here (or was it on another list?) Mad Libs = parts of speech. <br/>

Not there yet myself, but thought that might help. Good luck! <br/>

when kids must have them learned.<br/>
<br/>
In real life they can be absorbed as they&#39;re being used. They can be  <br/>
refined by using them, *exactly* the same way kids learn to speak.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some good information in the recent &quot;Language?&quot; thread.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Am I just suppose to let her do anything she wants all day<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are no rules or &quot;suppose to&quot;s in unschooling. There are though  <br/>
ways of being that help kids explore, help build relationships and  <br/>
ways that interfere with learning and relationships.<br/>
<br/>
Letting her do anything she wants all day is one piece of  <br/>
unschooling, but it cuts out the role of the parent. Unschooling  <br/>
parents are more involved. They do a lot of things ... like museums,  <br/>
hiking and zoos ;-) They run things through their kids lives they  <br/>
think the child might like. This will explain it well:<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in hopes that she finds something constructive to do??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Looking for &quot;constructive&quot; activity is one of those actions that will  <br/>
get in the way of natural learning. When kids are engaged it means  <br/>
they&#39;re learning something their right now self finds important. It  <br/>
might look like watching Spongebob over and over. It might look like  <br/>
playing with Barbies. It might look like planning what to spend  <br/>
birthday money on.<br/>
<br/>
Kids -- people -- are constantly constructing a web of connections  <br/>
that helps them see how the world works. So, if a child is in a *rich  <br/>
environment with engaged parents*, whatever the child chooses to do  <br/>
is constructive. (The rich environment with engage parents is vital.)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the hard parts of unschooling! We need to trust that  <br/>
whatever has captured their imagination is important to them. We may  <br/>
not understand its purpose or what they&#39;re using it for, but the  <br/>
engagement means they&#39;re doing some heavy duty constructing.<br/>
<br/>
What helps is being with them so parents can absorb enough about what  <br/>
they&#39;re into to have conversations about it and to support it  and  <br/>
strew some related things. The way you might do with a friend or your  <br/>
husband. Don&#39;t take over the interest. Let it be theirs. (Unless you  <br/>
are genuinely interested then it can become a common interest you  <br/>
share :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know for a fact that if I totally left it up to her there would  <br/>
&gt; no academics involved at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nor should there be if by academics you mean work that resembles school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She hates math and really doesn&#39;t enjoy reading even though she  <br/>
&gt; reads at her grade level or above.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If she hates them, you need to stop what you&#39;re doing and let her heal.<br/>
<br/>
A good way to make someone hate ice cream is to keep feeding it to  <br/>
them, making them eat it even when they say stop, keep going even  <br/>
when they throw up. The negative emotions will associate with the  <br/>
food and they will avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
In school they need to force feed math and reading and history to  <br/>
kids, not because the kids need it, but because schools need a  <br/>
uniform skill set throughout the classroom so the teacher can treat  <br/>
the room as a single unit and apply a single process to it (curriculum).<br/>
<br/>
These two pages will help you understand not only why unschooling  <br/>
won&#39;t look at all like school but why it must not if you want your  <br/>
daughter to really learn and not just memorize:<br/>

(Stop making her read. Really. Listen to books. Watch movies. Snuggle  <br/>
up together under a blanket with hot chocolate and read *to* her.  <br/>
Watch movies based on books. Immerse her in a world where her  <br/>
connections to the printed word are positive and she *will* read what  <br/>
*she* needs and wants to read on her own. I promise.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She couldn&#39;t care less about history no matter how it is presented  <br/>
&gt; to her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While not everyone will love history, I can pretty much guarantee  <br/>
that&#39;s not true. While I can rant about how poorly and backwards  <br/>
science and math instruction are and how they are churning out kids  <br/>
who have no clue what either subject is really about, history may be  <br/>
even worse. The majority of people&#39;s eyes will glaze over at the  <br/>
endless stream of dates and politics in history class. Not only does  <br/>
it turn them off of what is a fascinating subject but they forget as  <br/>
much as they can as soon as they can.<br/>
<br/>
Until someone has a reason for wanting to know why life was like it  <br/>
was and why the strings were being pulled one way rather than  <br/>
another, the dates and politics are meaningless. (I bet the kids who  <br/>
do like history class are immersed in history that fascinates outside  <br/>
of class.)<br/>
<br/>
If she enjoys watching movies or reading (or listening to) books set  <br/>
in historical times, visiting re-enactments, then she enjoys history.  <br/>
They don&#39;t need turned into lessons! The enjoyment of visiting  <br/>
another world, getting wrapped up in how people used to live is  <br/>
enough for now. It&#39;s like constructing a giant jigsaw puzzle, one  <br/>
interesting area at a time. The more interesting areas that are  <br/>
created, the more likely they&#39;ll fit together and the more larger  <br/>
patterns will emerge. But she needs to do the constructing, working  <br/>
on areas she thinks are interesting. If you try to direct her, it  <br/>
would be as interesting as someone sitting you down and telling you  <br/>
what area of their puzzle you need to work on and what order to put  <br/>
the pieces in. After several years of that, it would very likely turn  <br/>
you off of jigsaw puzzles for life!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you continue to do school, with or without quotes, it&#39;s likely to!  <br/>
Live life. Fully embrace what you both enjoy. Support and encourage  <br/>
her interests and explorations, regardless of whether they look like  <br/>
something educational or something done in school. Live as though  <br/>
school didn&#39;t exist.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>****************<br/>
<br/>
Ah, you have a misconception! You *don&#39;t* have to specifically memorize those things to learn them. Memorizing them doesn&#39;t guarantee retention, either, certainly not into adulthood. <br/>
<br/>
So how do people who don&#39;t memorize such things learn them? By being interested in those subjects and having a use for the information. Really. If your dd ends up using a lot of multiplication in her life she&#39;ll come to remember it easily, the same way a carpenter or mechanic can tell you without hesitation that 3/16 is in between 1/8 and 1/4 - although most of them can&#39;t do the math to tell you why! Similarly, most professional writers have a pretty fair grasp on the parts of speech without knowing what a &quot;future perfect&quot; is. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Am I just suppose to let her do anything she wants all day in hopes that she finds something constructive to do??<br/>
 </span></blockquote>******************<br/>
<br/>
If you look at someone&#39;s life through a lens of &quot;constructive&quot; or not, you miss a fair amount. What does your dd enjoy? Offer her more things she does, and may enjoy. Those are things that are &quot;meaningful&quot; to her on a personal level, an emotional and spiritual level. That&#39;s something education can&#39;t begin to touch, but unschooling can. Offer her those things that bring light to her eyes, whether that be a day of window shopping, or at the zoo, or snuggled under a big blanket watching tv. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t &quot;leave her&quot; to do any of those things unless she seems to want solitude - be a part of her life. At her side, you can learn to see what she values, what brings her joy, and she&#39;ll learn those things from you, too. Not because you make a lesson of them, but because she&#39;ll value you&#39;re presence. Kids Want to learn from their parents until we suck the joy out of learning by trying to educate them. <br/>
<br/>
Happily, that joy in learning is so intrinsic to human nature that it can and does grow back with unschooling. There&#39;s often a transitional time, where your dd might decompress by wanting to avoid anything &quot;educational&quot; for awhile. You can use that as a time to love her and enjoy her company (and research how people learn naturally if you&#39;re freaking out).<br/>

<br/>
My now-16yo stepson was much the same the year we pulled him out of school, at 13. He claimed to hate learning in every form. A year ago, when his bio mom expressed concern about what he was &quot;learning&quot; though, he said &quot;everyone learns all the time, its impossible to not learn anything....except in school&quot;. He no longer thinks of learning as something to avoid. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s learning math through wood and metal working. He&#39;s discovered there are things he likes to read - some novels, even. Just last night we were talking about the history of food - doesn&#39;t sound very academic, but we touched on the industrial revolution, the effect of immigration on American culture, and the temperance movement, all from me standing in the kitchen making eggnog. Those aren&#39;t subjects he wouldn&#39;t have cared much about if they&#39;d been &quot;presented&quot; to him, but I wasn&#39;t presenting, I was chatting and one thing led to another. That happens a lot in unschooling homes, in the same way it happens a lot with groups of friends. Someone says &quot;hey did you know...?&quot; and then everyone is sharing interesting knowledge or tidbits. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I know for a fact that if I totally left it up to her there would no academics involved at all.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>
<br/>
It really depends on what you mean by &quot;academics&quot;. If you mean she may never sit down with a textbook again, that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. They&#39;re not always the best resources in the real world! But if she&#39;s interested in nature its unlikely that she&#39;ll avoid seeking more and new information, it just won&#39;t look very much like writing reports. She might dabble in bird identification or want to watch movies about the rainforest. She might wonder about what zoo animals eat and how that differs from what they eat in real life and ask to look that up on the internet - or ask to make real food for a pet or pretend food for a toy. Those are all things my 8yo has done relatively recently. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want &quot;school&quot; to be a battle everyday like it has been the past year.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to battle, but it will involve you stepping back from the idea that learning looks like &quot;education&quot;. It looks like someone enjoying an interest! If you look for ways to support your dd&#39;s interests, and toss out new ideas now and then, when she seems to be running dry, you won&#39;t have nearly so many battles in your life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-750940634"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The sort of stuff that you actually have to memorize and learn<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why? Why is that a &quot;have to&quot;? When was the last time you actually USED a<br/>
part of speech particularly...&quot;Ok, now I need to use a gerund...&quot;?<br/>
There&#39;s no need to rotely memorize things that have meaning and purpose<br/>
in your life. You naturally absorb them. I have a brownie recipe nearly<br/>
memorized simply because I use it so darned much. DH can make a batch of<br/>
bagels from scratch without the cookbook because he&#39;s done it so much. <br/>
<br/>
Reading, math, etc are all tools to accomplish a goal. When there&#39;s a<br/>
reason and a purpose for using those tools, it makes sense to work on<br/>
those skills. Why is it that schools require memorizing parts of speech<br/>
yet don&#39;t require daily/weekly hammering practice? Odds are, being able<br/>
to use basic home repair tools would be more useful than knowing a<br/>
gerund from a participle.<br/>
<br/>
All that &#39;stuff&#39; you&#39;ve been doing together - museums, hikes, etc - keep<br/>
doing it. Also go to the grocery store, the post office, the bank, sit<br/>
together and pay bills (not as a lesson, though - DS often helps simply<br/>
because he likes to chat with me as we work...when he was littler he<br/>
just liked putting the self-adhesive address labels and stamps on the<br/>
envelopes...but he&#39;d leave the licking the envelopes to me because it<br/>
tastes yuck lol). <br/>
<br/>
All those &quot;basics&quot; really ARE basic - they are part of everyday life.<br/>
And life is not divided into subjects like &quot;history&quot; - when you sit<br/>
around the holiday table talking about great-grandma emigrating to the<br/>
U.S., that&#39;s History. Watching Bugs Bunny is tons of &quot;history&quot; (and<br/>
literature and classical music and lots of other stuff as well).<br/>
&quot;Academics&quot; are pretty immaterial - they have little to do with actually<br/>
learning. Sit back and try to see the learning that happens every day -<br/>
it probably looks nothing like school or &quot;academics&quot; because &quot;academics&quot;<br/>
are artificial constructs; living life is organic. Kind of like the<br/>
difference between commercially mass produced white bread and home made<br/>
whole wheat bread. There&#39;s only a passing resemblance because there&#39;s<br/>
wheat and yeast involved. The taste and texture and look are very<br/>
different. Similarly, learning organically only has a passing<br/>
resemblance to commercial mass produced schooling because some of the<br/>
same information is involved. The taste, texture, and look are<br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
DS is 11 and has never been to school, never been schooled at home<br/>
either. The other day, we went to a gathering of like-minded folks (but<br/>
folks he didn&#39;t know well). He introduced himself to someone there by<br/>
saying he knows pi to the second 5 (3.141592385) I learned pi to the<br/>
first 9 way back when (it was part of the cheer for the high school math<br/>
team). But, on &quot;Pi Day&quot; this year (3-14) he picked up the next 4 digits<br/>
(which I didn&#39;t know and sometimes still need to ask him for). He&#39;s<br/>
planning to add a couple more digits next year on Pi Day. He knows what<br/>
it&#39;s used for (he asked) but he just likes knowing it mostly, it&#39;s not<br/>
yet something he needs to use. He knows nouns and verbs because he likes<br/>
Mad Libs. If you ask him about &quot;history&quot; he&#39;ll look at you sideways.<br/>
But, if you ask him about the Korean War, for example, he can give you<br/>
some info because he likes watching MASH episodes on DVD. When my mom<br/>
had her aortic valve replaced recently, she needed a cardiac<br/>
catheterization first. When I was discussing the situation with DS, he<br/>
said &quot;Oh yeah, I saw that on House&quot; - he understood  the procedure and<br/>
what the purpose was without sitting in a biology or anatomy or whatever<br/>
class. We pull out resources AS resources - books with anatomy pictures,<br/>
dictionaries, other reference materials, websites, etc. They are used to<br/>
answer or supplement questions/curiosities that come up - like why is it<br/>
called a &#39;window&#39;? what&#39;s the difference between a cape and a peninsula?<br/>
Where is Hungary? Why is Oklahoma &#39;tornado alley&#39;? Sometimes we know the<br/>
answers, sometimes we need to check it out together.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Clearly you are not hanging out with your tech writers, Deb, and clearly you have never been to my house. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But we also make your point beautifully because, in a house full of writers, talking about the ins and outs of language and language terminology *has* meaning and purpose. It is something Frank and I have done in front of our kids joyfully and with great passion for their whole lives. They are also verbally inclined, so a lot of it &quot;took.&quot; There was no need to teach anything.<br/>
<br/>
They also see me making an effort to improve my spoken grammar; I correct myself all the time. It&#39;s modeling again. If skill in a certain area is important to you, YOU work on it. Have fun with it. Talk about grammar errors you see on TV and in print. Pick up a very fun little book called &quot;Anguished English,&quot; which is full of funny examples of poor writing. Create LOL Cat art (because doing things wrong on purpose creates awareness of what is right). Play with words.<br/>
<br/>
Grammar is like math in that it is a subject that people feel a lot of intimidation about. But like math, it can be a fun and natural part of life and learning. Start with the joy of it!</div>
