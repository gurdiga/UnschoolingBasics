<div id="ygrps-yiv-618650163">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
My name is Valerie, I&#39;m a single mum of two homeschooled kids and my <br/>
daughter loves to enter writing competitions. She came across one that <br/>
is ideal for children as it is for a book of meditations for children. <br/>
The link to the website is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/writingcompetition">http://www.geocities.com/writingcompetition</a><br/>
<br/>
I hope I didn&#39;t break any group rules by posting this for my first <br/>
post, but I think it&#39;s a great way to get kids to do some creative <br/>
writing.<br/>

<br/>
It helps unschooling flourish to provide opportunities that our kids  <br/>
might enjoy rather than thinking in terms of &quot;getting&quot; them to do  <br/>
something we think is valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Give them opportunities to reach out and choose things that look  <br/>
interesting rather than find paths to destinations we think are good  <br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an important mental shift to turn away from destinations and  <br/>
turn fully towards our kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  wow! i need this to pop up in my e-mail on a daily basis :)<br/>
   <br/>
  My oldest went to check out an art class where the teacher does what she calls open studio. The kids come in and work on whatever they want using whatever media they choose. the teacher helps as needed and is happy to not help and let them do . <br/>
   <br/>
  My mom the ex teacher found all kids of flaws with this class and I spend a lot of time defending my daughter and her choice of class.<br/>
   <br/>
  Later courtney wanted to hang something from the ceiling. we have 9 foot ceiling and she decided to measure me and determine how high of a chair we needed. It was all her idea and she was enjoying ..I didnt utter a word out loud but i couldnt help thinking oh kewl she is doing some math today! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748030475">Here&#39;s an example of this idea that happened last evening: the kids and a friend had made little homes in our house and were &#39;mailing and delivering&#39; small items. After a while they asked for paper, which I gave them.  Then I offered some manilla envelopes which I had bought, saying &#39;I bought these for you to see if you wanted them.&#39;  Then they filled these up with letters regarding their imaginary world.
