<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076151671">~I think that for a<br/>
kid who is constantly hearing a yelling mom, the urgency in her voice<br/>
may be relegated to background noise, if you know what I mean.~<br/>
<br/>
Yes, definitely. My Mom yelled all the time, we totally tuned her out.<br/>
<br/>
I really feel like I didn&#39;t take the time with my post about saying<br/>
&quot;STOP&quot; though. Not enough info. I guess because my children and I have<br/>
built these relationships of trust, I CAN say &quot;stop now&quot; and they know<br/>
I have a good reason. But it certainly doesn&#39;t have to be in a loud<br/>
voice either.<br/>
<br/>
Like with the sleeping brother. I would have kept my voice soft and<br/>
said very clearly &quot;that is NOT ok, come over here with me please&quot; or<br/>
something that would get the child out of that area so you could give<br/>
hugs, or discuss or whatever needs to be done.<br/>
<br/>
For some children, a hug while saying &quot;stop that&quot; will work great. If<br/>
he was too angry to be touched yet, it might not work.  I might have<br/>
said &quot;I&#39;m going to bring this toy into the other room, because I can<br/>
see you really want to push the noisy button, but it is NOT ok to wake<br/>
your brother&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are SO many options, none of them include ignoring the fact that<br/>
he refused to let the room stay quiet for the person that is sleeping.<br/>
