<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;I&#39;m wondering, really I am, I&#39;m not being facetious or tricky, because I<br/>
  have absolutely zero personal experience of a child demanding structure, or<br/>
  any kind of timetable assistance from me. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I have had an email virus so am not sure where this idea started but my 14yo <br/>
  verbally asks for structure.  She needs help to remember and keep up with <br/>
  all the stuff she chooses to do.<br/>
<br/>
  She asks me to make her a list the night before to help her stay on task the <br/>
  next day.  For example, she might forget to medicate her bunny who is <br/>
  fighting ear mites and she would feel badly about that.<br/>
<br/>
  Of course, this is also the kid that has asked for a full curriculum after 6 <br/>
  years of radical unschooling and is having a ball with it.  Go figure.<br/>

  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;some children demand structure.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; People post this idea quite a lot. I have mentioned it myself.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; But what the heck does it look like? Seriously, how does a child &quot;demand<br/>
  &gt; structure&quot;? Or how do you know if they are doing so?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Touching on Ren&#39;s (I think) reply, how can the parent be sure that the<br/>
  &gt; demand, whatever it looks like, is not just a child resisting healing from<br/>
  &gt; school damage and the self-deprecation that school can cause?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; What might &quot;demanding structure&quot; look like for a child who had never been <br/>
  &gt; to<br/>
  &gt; school?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I&#39;m wondering, really I am, I&#39;m not being facetious or tricky, because I<br/>
  &gt; have absolutely zero personal experience of a child demanding structure, <br/>
  &gt; or<br/>
  &gt; any kind of timetable assistance from me.<br/>
