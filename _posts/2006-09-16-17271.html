<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826513793">&quot;I don&#39;t disagree with this but I think we all follow our own<br/>
interests at some point. We all decide, about *something*, when,<br/>

I don&#39;t believe that is what makes a person an unschooler or not. I<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
If everyone and anyone is an unschooler the instant they learn a thing<br/>
on their own, then we don&#39;t need email lists to help people understand<br/>
this thing, we don&#39;t need conferences and nobody really needs to leave<br/>
school. I don&#39;t believe that on any level. I think unschooling is <br/>
HUGE shift in thinking for most people and it&#39;s a lot deeper than<br/>
simply learning something naturally. FAR deeper.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think telling new folks that everyone is an unschooler at some<br/>
point in their lives, simply by learning a new thing naturally, will<br/>
help anyone understand this lifestyle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127609615">I was never saying that everyone is or does what most of the people <br/>
on this list see unschooling to be.  I was only saying that even if <br/>
people don&#39;t *get* unschooling, or even if they have never heard the <br/>
word unschooling, that at some point in their lives they will learn <br/>
something in a natural way.  I&#39;ll apologize if something I said was <br/>
taken in the wrong light.  It certainly wasn&#39;t my intention to <br/>
misinform someone about the entire unschooling lifestyle.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-21603022">That being said, if I may offer a little bit of advice.<br/>
When people come on here who are new to the idea of unschooling, and really <br/>
want to do it with their kids, it would probably really help them a lot if <br/>
the unschooling &quot;experts&quot; were more helpful instead of harsh.  I realize <br/>
that you say, &quot;Anything you say here can be discussed&quot;.  That&#39;s why I am <br/>
expressing my opinion.  A lot of people who really mean well do get jumped <br/>
down the throats a lot.<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what unschooling&#39;s about.  I think if you are going to <br/>
claim to be about all this freedom, then you should not be so uptight about <br/>
innocent and minor word choices.  People don&#39;t mean malicious intent the way <br/>
they are sometimes taken by unschoolers online...<br/>

I don&#39;t think she was bothered by *you* saying that. I think she was kind of agreeing with your point and taking it a step further. It was my impression that she was bothered by the very thing you were already commenting on, the fact that teachers and parents talked about preparing us all for the real world as if we weren&#39;t already in it.<br/>

<br/>
Some of us have been doing this a long time , with amazing results, and feel we have a good grasp on how unschooling works and how to explain it to others.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us started unschooling only recently but have seen such dramatic changes in our home lives and children that we become passionate about sharing what we&#39;ve seen and done and learned.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us are questioning and searching for the right path for our children.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us have experienced the very scenarios others are asking about and feel confident in the answers we are giving.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us are feeling anything but confident as we take an entirely new path with our families.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us feel damaged by the forced schooling  we experienced and want to share that perspective with others. <br/>
<br/>
Some of us are just very confident by nature and able to discuss unschooling and parenting questions without hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
*All* of us are talking here. <br/>
<br/>
Questions get asked, scenarios are presented, comments are made, ideas are discussed and yes, word choice is debated. It&#39;s a healthy examination of ideas and commonly held beliefs. We&#39;re taking the phrases and tapes that run in our head subconsciously and bringing them to the surface for a fresh look. <br/>

<br/>
Nobody took anything to be malicious, nor was anyone offended. You&#39;re<br/>
deciding that&#39;s how people feel without even asking.<br/>
<br/>
And now you&#39;re posting about the posts, which is a meta-discussion and<br/>
not in line with our guidelines. Please refrain from telling others<br/>
how to post and simply post what you think is helpful.<br/>

Thanks for making that point.<br/>
I don&#39;t like the idea of &quot;experts&quot;, nor would I hope ANYONE would<br/>
defer their own experience and learning to some other person&#39;s advice.<br/>
I DO hope people can use other experienced unschoolers advice as a<br/>
jumping off point to finding their own truth.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I think it will help people understand why the list is as it is  <br/>
if they *don&#39;t* see it as a resource of people waiting to help  <br/>
newbies and *do* see it as a place where people love to discuss  <br/>
unschooling and the philosophy of unschooling and gentle, mindful  <br/>
parenting in a way that newbies can understand. And readers get the  <br/>
benefit -- for free! -- of writers following their interests.<br/>
<br/>
I had an epiphany recently -- though it&#39;s really a Blinding Flash of  <br/>
the Obvious as I heard it referred to once ;-) -- a list *is* its  <br/>
writers. A list *isn&#39;t* a product or service created to meet the  <br/>
needs of its membership. A list is a forum for people to put their  <br/>
ideas into words -- just as you did! :-) Without writers, without  <br/>
people with a desire to put thoughts into words, a list is no more  <br/>
than a collection of email addresses in a membership list. People --  <br/>
writers :-) -- answer questions they do in the way they do because  <br/>
they have a burning passion to put an idea into words.<br/>
<br/>
So when readers say &quot;Post differently&quot; they&#39;re saying &quot;Stop writing  <br/>
the way you love to write and write the way I want to read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No one&#39;s paying me or anyone here to crank out a product to any  <br/>
particular specifications! We write because we want to write. We  <br/>
answer the questions that interest us and that fill some need in us.  <br/>
Only the owners get to decide what kind of voices they want to support.<br/>
<br/>
If someone can&#39;t find voices here that are saying what they&#39;re  <br/>
seeking in a way that&#39;s meaningful to them, they do themselves an  <br/>
enormous favor to shop around to other lists and other resources to  <br/>
find something that does work for them. Don&#39;t waste your time on  <br/>
something that isn&#39;t meeting your needs.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I first started approaching radical unschooling (rather than just<br/>
curriculum unschooling which we had been doing for some time) and<br/>
joined this list at the invitation of Ren 3 or 4 years ago, I was at<br/>
first defensive and offended by what I saw as harsh answers.  Many<br/>
people on this list answer questions with questions and sometimes, *at<br/>
first*, those questions seem irrelevant to the question asked.  When I<br/>
first came to this list I *knew* that if I let my kids have no<br/>
responsibilities or limitations that they would turn out to be &quot;lazy<br/>
fat slobs.&quot;  I was horrified for some time at some of the responses I<br/>
got.  I was actually told that my children didn&#39;t trust me!  The<br/>
nerve!! :-)  But those words I had read kept coming back to me as I<br/>
started to loosen the reigns and start trusting my children.  Now I<br/>
seem to be one of those &quot;crazy unschooling moms&quot; whose words seem to<br/>
offend when there wasn&#39;t any offense to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that the responses to questions and problems aren&#39;t<br/>
supposed to give you an answer, but to make you think and question for<br/>
yourself.  It&#39;s meant to make you ponder what will work for your<br/>
family and hopefully you will see from post after post affirming<br/>
positive, mindful, gentle parenting that these things might work in<br/>
your family as well.  No one is condemning anyone on this list.<br/>
However, we will define what is and isn&#39;t unschooling or how something<br/>
is in contradiction with unschooling.<br/>
