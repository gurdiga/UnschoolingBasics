<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071978817">I don&#39;t know if any of you read Leo Babauta&#39;s blog &quot;Zen Habits&quot;, today I was pleasantly suprised to find a Sandra Dodd quote starting it off.  It might be a good post to share w/ friends and family who question why you unschool or what unschooling is.  <br/>

It was a good read for me as I&#39;m dealing w/ three girls who are not going to school this week while all their friends are going to school.  <br/>
 <br/>
My almost 13 year old was give a lecture by her 12 year old BFF last night on the importance of school and how a &quot;Middle School Drop Out is worse than a High School Drop out!!  <br/>
 <br/>
My almost 10 year old states regularly that she wants to go to school, even though school has never been a good fit for her (when she saw the character Dolores Umbridge in one of the Harry Potter movies she immediately said, &quot;She&#39;s like Ms. Lang!!&quot;  and if you aren&#39;t familair w/ Dolores Umbridge she is a truly horrible woman who pretends to be sweet and nice, Ms. Lang was my daughter&#39;s 1st grade teacher.)  <br/>
 <br/>
My 8 1/2 year old is feeling sad that her regular playmate down the block is heading back to school w/out her, even though she knows school was really boring.  All normal transition stuff, and we&#39;ll get through it, but it helps to be reminded why we are unschooling through blogs and books and articles since I&#39;m feeling my own set of transition emotions.<br/>
 <br/>
People talk about deschooling, but I haven&#39;t heard much discussion on the mixed emotions kids have about leaving school.  When it&#39;s all you&#39;ve ever known, leaving it behind can be hard and this week could possibly be one of our hardest.  <br/>

My stepson hated school, was thrilled at the idea of not having to go any more, but the weekend before we pulled him out of school he panicked and suggested maybe he should just finish the rest of the school year - this was in Nov. We managed to talk him down, promised to find and make opportunities for him to hang out and connect with his school friends. By the end of the school year he&#39;d nearly forgotten most of them - his life had become so different from theirs that they had nothing left in common.<br/>
