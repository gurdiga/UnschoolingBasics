<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006708651">There&#39;s a whole book called The Gift of Dyslexia that shows how the usual<br/>
methods fail miserably.  The author is a dyslexic and a very interesting<br/>
person.  He has a program that he designed for helping with the process of<br/>
learning to read.  Basically it replaces the highly verbal and symbolic<br/>
instruction with tactile ideas using 3D things like working with clay.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s still way too schooly.  If you&#39;re looking to show that school<br/>
doesn&#39;t work though, it gives some good arguements for that.<br/>
