<div id="ygrps-yiv-540018938">Hi, <br/>
I want to take a minute to thank everyone who took the time to read and <br/>
reply to my post and apologies for it taking so long as I&#39;ve had some <br/>
computer problems making it difficult to get online. <br/>
<br/>
I was the one who wrote about the evening visit from the police and the <br/>
letters, phone calls etc from someone telling me my dh was cheating. I <br/>
was also concerned about how this may affect our unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I read and appreciated all the responses and it helped just to know <br/>
others were out there. The advice given to me I found very helpful. <br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you so very much for your time and help and I hope <br/>
everyone has a great day!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064335087">I haven&#39;t posted in a while but I wanted to thank this group for the support I was given when I decided to let my son unschool.  He left school due to possible allergic reaction to chemicals or mold and I could immediately see that independent study or traditional homeschooling was not very attractive.<br/>
<br/>
By reading here and educating myself I had the courage to allow him to take the proficience test this past October and he passed!  It&#39;s such a relief to not be tied down to public school.<br/>
<br/>
He spends most of his days sleeping late, on the computer and doing his music.  He plays drums and has been teaching himself guitar, bass, things he may not otherwise have had time for.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been nice to have the extra time with him.<br/>
