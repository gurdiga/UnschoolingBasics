<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712237709">I was telling my hubby about the unschooling guild ( he is die hard  horde <br/>
while i am die hard alliance) and he thinks it is just the neatest idea  ever <br/>
and would love to be a part of it.  I thought I saved the e-mail with  the guild <br/>
name and Realm and all that but I guess I didn&#39;t, so could someone  please <br/>
forward the e-mail with all that info on it to me?  Thanks so much  in advance.<br/>

&quot; Work like you don&#39;t need the money, love like you&#39;ve  never been hurt, and <br/>
dance like you do when nobody&#39;s watching.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All that  is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people  do<br/>
nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Knowledge is power but how you use that power defines  wether you are good <br/>
or evil.&quot;<br/>
