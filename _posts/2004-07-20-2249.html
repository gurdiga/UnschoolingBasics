<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320769394">Congrats on your 3 week old!  And, this being your<br/>
third child, you must have gone through something<br/>
similar, no?  My almost two year old went through the<br/>
same tv/video watching as yours starting in my late<br/>
pregnancy with my second child.  I believe this is a<br/>
common occurrance, and there is actually an article<br/>
written about it in a past Mothering issue. <br/>
Personally, videos can be quite helpful especially<br/>
when there is another child who *needs* your<br/>
attendance, and also to give mom some time to herself<br/>
(teeth brushing, eating, bathroom- wow!).  So, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t feel too bad about it.  As your newborn gets<br/>
older, you will figure out what works for your family<br/>
and what you all feel good about.  You can watch the<br/>
program with your child as you nurse your baby!  Often<br/>
now, my first born will ask to watch a video first<br/>
thing in the morning, and I usually try to encourage<br/>
playing first thing instead, or at least eating<br/>
breakfast before a video.  Playgroups are helpful too-<br/>
you can host one at your house and have extra help<br/>
watching/entertaining your older girls, or perhaps a<br/>
friend can take one/both of your girls to a playgroups<br/>
thus giving you a little alone time with your newborn.<br/>
 Trips to the library are also fun, and you can get<br/>
some new books/ reading done there, AND check out new<br/>
videos/DVDs.  It&#39;s also a fairly easy outing- if your<br/>
children are patient enough to stand in line while<br/>
items get checked out.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your newly expanded family!<br/>

Why? What is wrong with watching a video first or during breakfast? It<br/>
sounds like you still have residual anti-video feelings if these other<br/>
things have a higher priority.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn almost always wants one of her recorded tv shows first thing after<br/>
getting up. I think she uses the familiarity of it as a calm transition from<br/>
sleeping to waking. I bring her whatever breakfast she asks for, and after<br/>
more or less time, she is on to playing with her dolls or getting dressed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-473606964">All three of my girls liked to get up and watch tv right away in the <br/>
mornings -- they watched Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers a lot, first <br/>
thing in the morning, and Rosie watched Arthur at 8:30 am every weekday <br/>
for YEARS - and still does, at 13, several days per month.  She also <br/>
really likes to watch tv right before she goes to sleep - another <br/>
transition help. I remember getting up and watching tv in the early <br/>
mornings, too, when I was a kid. Captain Kangaroo was my favorite.<br/>
<br/>
They were not damaged by tv watching. They are voracious readers and <br/>
extremely literate - they read challenging material and love it.  This <br/>
week Roxana read &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and looked up stuff about it on the <br/>
internet and talked about it off and on throughout the last couple of <br/>
days. She has also been reading material by and about Maya Angelou. And <br/>
she&#39;s just started reading, &quot;Camille,&quot; and telling me about it. Roya is <br/>
off camping and took a pile of books with her. Rosie read the fourth <br/>
Harry Potter book for about the 10th time this week as well as checking <br/>
out all of Lois Lowry&#39;s books that she could find, from the library, <br/>
and reading and rereading those.<br/>

I didn&#39;t write this, but could have. Not to start another thread on<br/>
unlimited tv (I&#39;ve read and pondered most of them), but I do feel it<br/>
my spiritual parental responsibility to shield the girls from<br/>
violence, sexual content, and humor that is excessive/too adult.<br/>
But I am not sure why I feel the way I do about time spent on<br/>
even &quot;acceptable&quot; shows/videos. I was not limited as a child and no<br/>
one in my family limits. I guess it just seems too passive.  As in <br/>
why read if it can be paraded in front of you?  Something else to <br/>
ponder...</div>

 <br/>
 <br/>
Watching TV is passive while stringing beads on a wire? Watching TV  while <br/>
jumping on the mini-trampoline? while putting together a puzzle? while  braiding <br/>
your brother&#39;s hair? while knitting socks? while playing with magnets?  while <br/>
pulling rubber bands on a geo-board? while brushing the dog? while eating  <br/>
spaghetti?<br/>
 <br/>
All of these things are more passive than reading?<br/>
 <br/>
Ya think?<br/>
