<div id="ygrps-yiv-68483082">I came home from the conference with a copy of Rue&#39;s book (which I read on  <br/>
the airplane...it&#39;s wonderful!!)<br/>
 <br/>
My niece has an almost one year old son and she and her husband have  asked <br/>
me skeptically several times about unschooling.  He&#39;s a lawyer and  both had <br/>
what they consider to be excellent public school  educations.   About a month <br/>
ago, I took the book over saying...&quot;this  book was written by an unschooling mom <br/>
we know ...the kids are so great....you  might enjoy some of her ideas.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
We stopped by to visit a few days ago and within a few minutes she  <br/>
said...&quot;I&#39;ve been reading that book and I just love it.  I&#39;m not saying I  would ever <br/>
unschool but I have some questions...&lt;g&gt;.  She talked  about how she could see <br/>
the benefits to the gentle parenting but her concern and  her mother-in-laws <br/>
concern was....&quot;Doesn&#39;t unschooling produce children  that are selfish?&quot;  and <br/>
&quot;What becomes of these kids when they are  adults..can they get jobs...?&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
Brenna (my 16 year old daughter) answered her questions by talking about  <br/>
some of the kids she knows from the conferences and Not Back To School Camp and  <br/>
I promised to lend her Roya&#39;s CD from the conference.  We&#39;re in Albuquerque  <br/>
so I&#39;ll ask her to come to the conference next year and continue to answer her  <br/>
questions.  <br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t unschool when my kids were young (they are 16 and 12 now)  so when <br/>
she has asked questions before I could just respond with what I&#39;d  read.  With <br/>
Rue&#39;s Book I could say...&quot;We know this family and they are so  cool&quot;  She was <br/>
interested enough then to read it.  Even if she never  unschools, I see it <br/>
having a positive effect on her parenting and on her son&#39;s  life.<br/>
 <br/>
So......my plug for Rue&#39;s book.....buy one for you and a couple of extra to  <br/>
lend to family and friends...&lt;g&gt;.  Thanks for writing it, Rue.<br/>

 <br/>
Cameron&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s mother called him today to ask what was wrong with Carly: she seemed sad and surly.<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron tried to be tactful and not attack her mom, but he wanted to let her know that demanding that <br/>
Carly be home by 10:00 on her birthday Monday was kind of arbitrary.<br/>
 <br/>
I suggested that he give her a copy of Rue&#39;s book---and that *after* she read it, I would be willing to meet<br/>
her for lunch and discuss it---and our parenting. My relationship with Cameron and Duncan is more<br/>
important than anything else---it has priority over everything. This is the basis of Rue&#39;s book. Carly <br/>
read over my shoulder as I was editting and said, &quot;I wish Rue were MY mother!&quot; I don&#39;t think I need to tell <br/>
her mom THAT, exactly. &lt;g&gt; But I can show her how many of her arbitrary rules are damaging their <br/>
relationship.<br/>
 <br/>
She will NEVER unschool (and Carly&#39;s a senior this year anyway), but her relationship could be improved <br/>
dramatically if she followed some of Rue&#39;s suggestions.<br/>
 <br/>
so...Yes! Rue&#39;s book can allow some positive changes even for NONunschoolers. It&#39;s really about the <br/>
parenting (which is what we radical unschoolers think anyway! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>

is fighting over math with her son.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;There is NO academic subject that is important enough to risk  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>harming a parent-child relationship. NOTHING is more important than  <br/>
your relationship. There is no work - school work, housework, yard  <br/>
work, or anything else, that is more important than your  <br/>
relationship. ALWAYS put that first. What are you going to give  <br/>
thanks for on Thanksgiving Day? That your son mastered algebra or  <br/>
that you love each other and respect each other? Don&#39;t risk what is  <br/>
REALLY important, for what is less important.&lt;<br/>
