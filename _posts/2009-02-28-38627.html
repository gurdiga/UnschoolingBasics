<div id="ygrps-yiv-808289873">Hi all.<br/>
I&#39;m new to unschooling and these lists.  I&#39;d noticed there is a <br/>
lot of theory but not a lot about what unschooling is like in the <br/>
real world.<br/>
Where can i find some information and interact with those who are <br/>
sharing their every day lives, not just the theory side of <br/>
things?<br/>
Thanks much.<br/>
Steph</div>

those has links to their favorite blogs:<br/>

<br/>
There are probably blogs at Radical Unschoolers Network:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyrun.ning.com/profiles/blog/list">http://familyrun.ning.com/profiles/blog/list</a><br/>
<br/>
And most people have fancied up their profiles with information.<br/>
<br/>
The practical stuff is often shared when people bring up a specific  <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
Philosophy and practical work hand in hand. Philosophy is basically  <br/>
what you test action against to make sure you&#39;re keeping with what  <br/>
you value. The practical shows what the philosophy can look like when  <br/>
put into  action in a particular situation. They clarify each other.<br/>
