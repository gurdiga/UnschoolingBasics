<div id="ygrps-yiv-737040277">My 4 y/o son has a vision problem and needs corrective lenses to keep his eyes straight, so he can develop stereopsis (3-d vision) that he lacks right now. Same as his sister but her lenses also correct her vision. So she would always wear hers at this age, while he resists wearing his.<br/>
<br/>
I am at a loss as to what to do to remain relaxed and calm myself when he refuses to wear them. He doesn&#39;t see the benefit because his near and far vision is fine. Right now what I do is say &quot;no TV&quot; if he refuses to wear them. But he&#39;s often ok with that, so it doesn&#39;t &quot;work.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t stand myself for not coming up with something that isn&#39;t a punishment for not wearing them and not being able to just be OK with him not wearing them. He&#39;s just 4 and has no idea how not wearing them now will impact his day to day life in the future. I realize he can have a good life without 3-d vision, but with crossed eyes, that will impact him everyday, for his whole life, so that&#39;s weighing on my mind. Help?<br/>

many thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090632277">If it&#39;s any comfort, we are going through a similar thing with our 3-1/2 yo nephew. We encourage him to wear the glasses when reading, etc., but, short of duct-taping the glasses to his head, we really have no choice when he says: &quot;No way!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We are, otoh, happy he is saying anything as he hasn&#39;t really started talking yet.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s part of why we try not to be too tense about the glasses -- it is one of several problems he has. <br/>
<br/>
Do you find, as we do, that once the glasses are on, they are no longer an issue? Once our nephew puts his on, he will wear them for 15 minutes to 2 hours at a stretch without fussing with them at all. <br/>

<br/>
Yes, some times when they are on he just forgets about them. Not so much these days though. As you say there is really no choice when he says no, because he will start bending them, or throw them to the floor... <br/>

Just knowing my ds, unfortunately I don&#39;t think he would go for me sticking something in his eyes everyday....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735628014">Can you figure out what it is he dislikes about them? Is it just the hassle of wearing them? Is there something Else he&#39;d wear on his face that you could have corrective lenses installed in? Or some kind of glasses that are fun enough - or enough like something a favorite character would wear - that he&#39;d be into doing it for the fun? <br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t help but think that part of the reason they&#39;re starting this now is that most younger kids, punished or not, go through much the same thing - kids are kids! It might help to do some extra research on your own and find out how much he really &quot;needs&quot; to wear them - and then step back and see if he&#39;ll average out to the same amount of time in typical unschooling fashion (a whole day here and there instead of &quot;four hours a day five days a week&quot;). <br/>
<br/>
Its also worth researching any kinds of physical therapy - just glancing through links there seems to be some that can help and not just young children, so the matter may not be as time-sensitive as doctors are leading you to think. It may be something you can incorporate into your regular play, even!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998219807">Hi Natalie,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your story. The reason for glasses now is that his vision can most likely be corrected with just lenses, and possibly vision therapy in a year or two. And that it will stay corrected once it is. Whereas if he waits until he&#39;s an adult, he can attain 3-d (you probably could, too if you wanted to. Read &quot;Fixing My Gaze by Sue Barry. She is a patient of my son&#39;s eye dr.) but it will most likely not be permanent. <br/>
<br/>
He isn&#39;t wearing them right now, but has worn them some today. The main reason he gives  is that they don&#39;t help him see better. But that&#39;s not the point, they are meant to keep his right eye straight. Otherwise his vision is fine. <br/>
<br/>
So what I&#39;m doing is just offering them and surprisingly he took them and put them on himself this morning. But just refused to put them back on. He was wearing them all day for awhile, and I would prefer that, but will simply allow him his preferences and keep offering...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all:-)<br/>
