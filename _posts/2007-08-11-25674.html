<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882075493">Emily and I were just curious about what everyone else is doing. Our  <br/>
house is still rousing at 11pm...<br/>
Josh is giving dad and Sam hints for Mario Kart on the Game cube<br/>
Breanna is playing Super Monkey ball on the Wii<br/>
Emily is letting her stripes dry while making smart alecky comments  <br/>
about scooby doo<br/>
Dan is watching scooby doo 2, and fading fast<br/>
Avari and Rachel are sleeping, Ava in her bed, and Rachel on the couch.<br/>
I&#39;m dyeing people&#39;s hair as they come up to me, while snuggling Dan  <br/>
and watch movies in between.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow the kids are going to assorted friends houses while dh and I  <br/>
attend my 15th reunion. I&#39;m glad to be going, but sad that my hands  <br/>
are dyed purple and green, and I&#39;m about three months behind on a  <br/>
haircut....so tomorrow I&#39;m breaking out the lava rock and getting a  <br/>
hair cut lol! Wish me luck (nothing can get rid of the excess baby  <br/>
weight lol!) I&#39;m okay with that tho<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-265392128">Hi, <br/>
my 3 y.o. just went to sleep around 11 pm while having<br/>
me read Big Bear Ball and some German books. Lucian <br/>
(5) is drawing a book called the Race for the missing<br/>
piece of the lost hammer. He must have started around<br/>
10:30 and now at 1 pm he is still at it. Every 5<br/>
minutes he calles me in to dictate me the captions to<br/>
his pictures. I wish he would go to sleep but I am<br/>
also very much enjoying to see where the story is<br/>
going. In between writing captions I read my emails<br/>
and try to figure out that damn letter to the<br/>
superintendent trying to come up with an unschooling<br/>
curriculum - two words that really don&#39;t go together.<br/>
My husband Dan is probably still painting and the<br/>
teenagers are still awake too and until recently were<br/>
doing some music.<br/>
Tomorrow we are cleaning the yard and getting party<br/>
supplies for a party on sunday.<br/>
Good weekend to you all!<br/>
Mara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-267196085">Last night at 11pm we were all asleep as far as I know... At least I<br/>
was. It&#39;s the MORNING PEOPLE  [:D]<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though. Since the heat in the middle of the day has been just<br/>
unbearable this past week we have started getting up around 5 to work in<br/>
the early cool of the morning. Yesterday about the time it got<br/>
unbearable we all got in the river and went for a wade. Ended up walking<br/>
about two miles upstream looking for wood to carve and other fun things<br/>
like frogs and snakes. The boys found a ring-necked snake, some turkey<br/>
feathers, and a baby squirrel that had fallen from a nest. They are<br/>
taking turns nursing that squirrel so I guess some one was up tending<br/>
the poor thing. I&#39;m hoping it will live but doubtful. His little eyes<br/>
are not open yet so they are bottle feeding him.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has become Saturday morning unschooling here. I did not read the <br/>
post last night...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lets see I am making sweet pickles that are sugar free. I am very <br/>
excited. Ashton 11 has been helping me and in just a little bit we <br/>
will be off to see Hairspray.  <br/>
<br/>
DH has helped me round up jars and get going. He also accidentally <br/>
brought a mouse in the house, which caused quite a stir and then <br/>
released it to the woodpile.<br/>
<br/>
We have had a boy staying with us the last three nights and Tycen 9, <br/>
Levi 13 have been playing Twilight Princess, Diablo, and Halo with <br/>
him. They also took metal this morning to the recycling center, <br/>
which they are hoping will give them enough cash to buy a new game. <br/>
<br/>
Olivia, 7 had been feeding the chickens and other critters this <br/>
morning with help from her dad and I. She has watched several sponge <br/>
bob shows and taken a long luxurious shower. She just left with her <br/>
dad to buy him a sundae at Mcdonalds. She also had a round at Diablo.<br/>
<br/>
Robby 14 and Jessy 16 spent the night in at friends last night and <br/>
are on their way home now. This afternoon they will be helping DH <br/>
install Robs bedroom door. That will mean all the bedrooms in our <br/>
house now have doors!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Megan 17 went with her friend to a three day concert, featuring <br/>
Kansas, Molly Hatchett and ELO... Or what is left of them. She has <br/>
phoned everyday to tell me what fun she is having.<br/>
<br/>
I think that is it on the journey from us.. Oh there was also some <br/>
kids heelying on the hardwood floors earlier this morning, but that <br/>
sums it up.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing everyone on the list a great day!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-54660050">Friday night when you posted this, I was too tired to write! We were<br/>
getting up early to head over to Hickory NC for a homeschooling<br/>
conference Saturday morning. So I&#39;ll just post some random stuff<br/>
that&#39;s been going on over here lately.<br/>
<br/>
The conference was a lot of fun and we met some new folks from the<br/>
lists. The NC crew did a great job organizing that event, I imagine<br/>
the attendance will be even higher next year. I got to hang out with<br/>
Kelly too...that&#39;s always great!<br/>
<br/>
My kids had a ball playing and reconnecting with some of their<br/>
friends. We hung out at the Asheville mall on the way home. We left<br/>
Trevor there, with Moira&#39;s family (his gf) and we won&#39;t see him for a<br/>
week. It&#39;s weird having him gone more lately.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of us picked up some Cinnabons which are making the house<br/>
smell lovely this morning. Ciara and Jalen have been building box<br/>
&quot;houses&quot; for the baby kitties and re-arranging their area over and<br/>
over. Jalen gets this veeerrrry high-pitched squeaky voice when he<br/>
talks to the kittens. It cracks us up.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re getting ready to celebrate Jared&#39;s birthday tomorrow, with a<br/>
friend that has a birthday close to him. We&#39;ll have an airsoft battle<br/>
in the backyard. I&#39;m trying to have a quiet, calm morning after a<br/>
hectic week so I can re-charge before we run around for party supplies.<br/>
<br/>
There is an Imagination Tribe trade to work on, a floor to mop and<br/>
snacks to buy. Ciara and I will do our soapy-water--all-over-the-floor<br/>
mopping. Lotsa fun.:) We get lots of soapy water and splash it<br/>
everywhere then zoom around with rags on our feet. After that, we get<br/>
towels and throw them down to soak it all up. Voila! Clean floors.<br/>
<br/>
The exciting news this week was Jalen losing another tooth (his<br/>
second) which he has proudly showed anyone who stands still long<br/>
enough, Ciara writing her first chapter for a book, Jared reaching<br/>
level 60 on World of Warcraft and Trevor going off to NC to help his<br/>
gf move into her college dorm.<br/>
<br/>
OH, and Jalen&#39;s watermelons he is growing are getting BIG. Very<br/>
exciting!:)<br/>
