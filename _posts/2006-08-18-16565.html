I have the benefit of also having a 12 y.o. that just learned to read<br/>
this last year, so I KNOW it will happen in it&#39;s own time and way. No<br/>
worries.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just the other day my hubby said that he feels that my son needs to learn how to do what is usually thought of as the foundational subjects and skills NOW.  He said that what he has read is that if a child falls behind now that he will be behind forever.  I found his statement to be so startling that I just moved on.  So when I read Ren&#39;s reply today it really struck me.  Is there a difference between a child who starts reading earlier and one who does not?  One of my cousins could not read until she was 16 and she was in school.  She had lots of issues that prevented her from being able to focus on what was going on in school but she has gone on to college and received different medical certifications.  I don&#39;t read her writing often but I have to believe what I always read here, people get it when they get it.<br/>
<br/>
My hubby is not an unschooler.  I don&#39;t talk about the radical unschooling lifestyle much with him, I just live it and accommodate him on the points that he gets most intense about.  So I do just a little work on letters with my near 6 yr old to accommodate his wishes for &quot;educational&quot; activities to occur.  I have no desire to push my son before he is ready to read.  I trust in this process.  I guess I am trying to figure out how I can provide info to my husband that will help him to understand that there are so many paths to learning that land us all in a place where we are actually functional people who can  achieve whatever it is that we desire to achieve.<br/>
<br/>
My hubby and I are corporate america meets tree hugger. What an interesting freakin&#39; combination. :) Thank Goddess the tree hugger is running the home.  LOL  But seriously, I would appreciate any info and comments.  Thank you in advance.<br/>

Namaste<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s exactly right...if you&#39;re talking about school. And 180 degrees <br/>
from unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Consider: <br/>
<br/>
in school, kids above K age (whatever that is where you are) are <br/>
expected to read and write their worksheets silently at their seat. <br/>
Homework is all &#39;bookwork&#39; - reading and writing again, even for <br/>
arithmetic (gotta read the instructions, write the answers, etc). As <br/>
the grades go up, there&#39;s more reading, more writing, involved. So, <br/>
if one isn&#39;t reading up to speed by 7 or 8 yrs old, they will indeed <br/>
bog down very quickly and start losing ground or need to work very, <br/>
very hard to keep up.<br/>
<br/>
At home, however, there is no &quot;behind&quot; - who can your son be behind <br/>
except himself? (I&#39;ve heard of people being beside themselves but <br/>
never behind themselves lol). And, too, he is not expected to sit <br/>
and do worksheets and such on his own with little or no input from <br/>
you. Learning happens in the way and time that works best for him, <br/>
not what works &#39;on average&#39; for the &#39;average&#39; 6 yr old (that non-<br/>
existant average kid). <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m new to unschooling, but I&#39;ve taught school for years.  I can tell you this is very true IF your child is attending school.  There&#39;s no magic age, it is just that they will get sooooo far behind in the classroom that they&#39;ll never be able to get caught up.  Each year they just grow farther behind.  It is quite sad.  I&#39;ve seen kids who got behind in kindergarten and have just spun their wheels since.  <br/>
<br/>
Your son has nothing to fall behind in though, so you have nothing to be concerned about.  You&#39;re not going to move on anyways, you&#39;ll just do it when he&#39;s ready and teach him what he needs to know when he is there.  He won&#39;t be ready to learn that letters have sounds and have you trying to teach him how to dissect a fascinating piece of literature (most likely dissecting until it has been so beat into the ground that those who can read it will wish they couldn&#39;t anyways).  When what they learn is tailored to their needs, there is no right time and there is nothing to fall behind on. <br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>
