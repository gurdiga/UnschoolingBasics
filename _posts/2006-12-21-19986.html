<div id="ygrps-yiv-43589764">I was reading a book about homeschooling an autistic child, and the author made a point that struck me profoundly. I had been noticing how much more relaxed my child is now that he is homeschooled/unschooled. His speech and behavior have improved tremendously. Yet when I needed to stop by the local school for a few minutes, he flew into a panic. He told me emphatically that he did not want to go to school, he is all done with school. And while we were in the building, he regressed into autistic behavior... speech, actions, and everything went right out the window.<br/>
   <br/>
  What the book I was reading pointed out was Maslow&#39;s Hierachy of needs. Basically, need #1 was physiological: food, water, air. Need #2 was safety: security, stability, freedom from fear, anxiety and chaos. #3 was belongingness and love: giving/receiving love, finding a place to belong. #4 esteem: achievement, adequacy, self-esteem. The author said that a teacher controls her classroom by fear and intimidation. If learning doesn&#39;t occur until level 4, then how can a child be expected to learn unhindered when need #2 is being circumvented? Not to mention that autistic child (or substitute special needs, or even a child who simply doesn&#39;t always fit in) tends to be ignored, left alone, and treated as &quot;different&quot;, it erodes need #3.<br/>
   <br/>
  No wonder my child doesn&#39;t even want to set foot inside his old school!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017654367">My daughter 6 has Asperger&#39;s as one of her many issues, and she definately had problems in a school setting.   But it was my 8 year old daughter that felt like she was suffocating.  She never felt safe there because she was bullied and teased so badly because of her small size.  Then add that she always felt stressed there, and she did feel like it was chaotic.  So she shut down, and no learning was occurring for her.  I am so thankfully I listened to her.  She came home everyday for a month and told me that she was done with the place, and wanted to be homeschooled.  She is happy and thriving now!  And I&#39;m so glad for your son he is not in that environment anymore.  Interesting book, something I should consider getting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256887684">I&#39;m responding to this post as a way to introduce myself.  Hope that is ok.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Nova Scotia, Canada, Married, and we unschool our 4 children<br/>
who live at home.  (we have some history with the 2 oldest having been<br/>
in school - nightmare - need I say more?).  We&#39;ve been unschooling for<br/>
the past 4 years.  (Started off as &quot;homeschooling&quot; the reawakening of a<br/>
dormant, lifelong dream, actually, then relaxed and unschooled the rest<br/>
of the time)<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is PDD (kind of a &quot;lump&quot; diagnosis on the autism spectrum),<br/>
and people who knew us when she was in school vs now are amazed when<br/>
they see her.<br/>
<br/>
Her most pressing &quot;special need&quot; was freedom to be authentically<br/>
herself, and to be accepted, in a safe and facilitating environment.<br/>
Whoda thunk?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll post more as time allows and as relevant subject matter comes up.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-20089486">The book is called, &quot;Homeschooling the Child with<br/>
Asperger Syndrome&quot; by Lise Pyles. It was the only<br/>
homeschooling book that I could find locally that was<br/>
actually geared towards autism/asperger&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
The part that talks about Maslow is only 2 pages of<br/>
the whole book... but with everything that I had been<br/>
observing lately, it really clicked with me. I hope<br/>
you find it equally helpful.<br/>
<br/>
(Incidentally, the author does discuss unschooling,<br/>
and uses it in a blend of methods to work with her child.)<br/>
