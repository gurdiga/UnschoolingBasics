Then play. With them. Have fun. See where you are in a year. <br/>

Jordan sounds like a wonderful kid who shouldn&#39;t have to put up with the dreck in a typical curriculum. (Should anyone?)<br/>
<br/>
Be brave, Mom! :)<br/>

Hi Every one I need help please, My son Jordan is 6 and I started &quot; Homeschooling &quot; him last year in kindergarten with arizona virtual academy an online charter school and im telling you it has really burned us both out , its so much stuff and he is creative and artistic and loves to do that stuff and I have been really researching and wanting to find a better way to teach my son school and i have a 4 year old too who I have been stressed about teaching him too. I really lvoe my kids and love having them home with me and believe in being their teacher very much and I have been reading so much about unschooling and it seems like a very good idea but I seem to have all the fears that i read about and I dont know where to start because Jordan is so turned off by school right now because of the online academy and both of us feeling pressured that I am afraid he will not WANT to learn on his own and he has a grasp on reading but is not perfect at it yet and he knows how to add<br/>
and subtract . he doesnt know nouns and verbs etc, I just couldnt get him to understand that concept yet and I get worried he wont be smart as an adult but yet he is very smart and a wonderful artist , he loves to paint and draw pictures, he draws like 30 pictures a day because he loves it and he talks like an intelectual and he ahs this great personality , He also loves the cooking channel very much. so I was just really wanting some good advice from you all and hekp me know where to start and what to do. I know the arizona laws are pretty simple when it comes to home schooling , all i have to do is send an letter of intent to homeschool, which the virtual academy is not technicly homeschooling but all i knew to do as of last year, well thankyou I would love to hear feed back .<br/>
thanks candy<br/>

Oh my....there is no six year old on earth that needs to know any of<br/>
the above. I think 6 year olds might need to know how to dig in the<br/>
dirt, or blow bubbles, or play a made-up game or climb a tree (or<br/>
maybe not, depending on the 6 year old)! But nouns and verbs? WHY??<br/>
Why does anyone really need to know that until they WANT to know it?<br/>
Reading perfectly at 6 is NOT &quot;normal&quot; or desirable. That&#39;s the school<br/>
system convincing you it is, but that&#39;s not true.<br/>
<br/>
My 13 year old learned to read fluently at age 12.5. He reads better<br/>
than my dd who learned to read around the &quot;typical&quot; age of 6. Reading<br/>
happens naturally if you trust that humans want to learn what they are<br/>
surrounded by. Same with math. Same with growing a garden or painting<br/>
a picture or any other activity a child might choose. People learn<br/>
what they are INTERESTED in.<br/>
<br/>
If he never wants to learn what a noun or verb are, I don&#39;t believe<br/>
that will hinder his success in life whatsover. Losing his passion and<br/>
zeal for life and learning will definitely impact his life in a big way.<br/>
