<div id="ygrps-yiv-992622495">I know I&#39;ve seen a couple of other people post about kids wanting to learn<br/>
ASL to communicate with the deaf, so I wanted to direct you all to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.deafcoffee.us/index.html">http://www.deafcoffee.us/index.html</a><br/>
There are deaf clubs in every state that meet up just for the enjoyment of<br/>
signing.  They encourage new learners from ASL classes, etc. to come and<br/>
jump in with the learning.  The one I attended this month there were<br/>
actually some kids at.  So pass this on to yours if they&#39;re interested.<br/>
It&#39;s a great way to learn the language.<br/>
