<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077964772">I also like PET and the Adele Faber/ Elaine Mazlish books (they also wrote Liberated Parents, Liberated Children), and I believe someone mentioned Dr Sears&#39;s The Discipline Book, which is very helpful, especially regarding younger children.  I also have some other recommendations:<br/>
<br/>
Between Parent and Child by Dr. Haim Ginott...this is the guy that inspired Faber and Mazlish and I think he does a better job than they do of explaining the types of praise.<br/>
<br/>
How to Really Love Your Child by Dr. Ross Campbell...explains the importance of eye contact, physical affection, and focused attention<br/>
<br/>
The Positive Discipline series by Jane Nelson<br/>
<br/>
Loving Your Child is Not Enough: positive discipline that works by Nancy Samalin<br/>
<br/>
kindof in a different vein, but I also recommend:<br/>
<br/>
The Feeling Child by Arthur Janov, Phd (this is the author of The Primal Scream)<br/>
<br/>
The Hurried Child: Growing up too fast too soon by David Elkind<br/>
<br/>
and, tho not sure how appropriate it is to mention on an unschooling list, but I got a lot out of  The Absorbant Mind (and everything else) by Maria Montessori.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents<br/>
<br/>
