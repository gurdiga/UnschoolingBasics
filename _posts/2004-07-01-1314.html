<div id="ygrps-yiv-394522469">&quot;:)  Anyway,<br/>
advice on how to go about unschooling and deschooling (ourselves and<br/>
mainly, our parents) is helpful.  And info on unschoolers getting into<br/>
universities - how do they do it, what about diplomoas, etc. - would<br/>
help our case with our parents.  With luck, in time, they will grow to<br/>
respect our decision about how we want to raise our family.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well....my advice is to not talk about unschooling or schooling or anything with them yet. You&#39;ve got years before he&#39;s even school age, and truthfully, it&#39;s none of their business.:)<br/>
Wait, and if it&#39;s still an issue when he IS school age, give them some books and magazines on unschooling and tell them you&#39;d be happy to discuss it further AFTER they&#39;ve done some research and reading.<br/>
You could spend a lot of time and energy trying to convince family, when your energy would be better spent just happily learning with your child.<br/>
It&#39;s too soon to waste energy that way anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
As to the college/university thing, there are many, many stories of successful unschoolers navigating college. There are many, many stories of unschoolers happily doing things other than college too.<br/>
I think if you stick around, keep on reading, you&#39;ll begin to hear real life stories and slowly pick up more and more confidence.<br/>
You&#39;ve got time...relax, enjoy the stories and joyfully explore life with your child.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*****I agree with Ren (as usual). Just before Laurie graduated from <br/>
college, the local paper interviewed us (it&#39;s on my website) and Mom <br/>
& Dad&#39;s friends made a fuss over the interview and what I had done. <br/>
They started asking Mom lots of questions about unschooling and she <br/>
said, &quot;I have no idea what unschooling is.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I was never totally open with them about what I was doing because I <br/>
didn&#39;t want them to turn us in to the school board or deal with <br/>
their criticism. I knew what I was doing was the right thing for <br/>
Laurie so it didn&#39;t matter what others thought. <br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>
