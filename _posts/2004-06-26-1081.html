<div id="ygrps-yiv-737752151">This is my first post here but I guess I&#39;ll just jump right in.  The area of<br/>
bedtimes was one of the easier ones for me.  We&#39;ve all got our places where<br/>
it was hard to let go.  My son is 4 1/2.  When he was a baby, as most of us<br/>
probably did, he followed his need for sleep.  When he was almost 2, there<br/>
was a strange cultural phenomenon that seemed to occur: a strong bias for<br/>
starting schedules for children.  Everywhere I seemed to look people were<br/>
saying how important it was for your child to have them asleep by a certain<br/>
time.  They said they didn&#39;t get the right kind of sleep unless they went to<br/>
bed by a certain hour.  We co slept and he woke many times and I was<br/>
exhausted.  The names Weissbluth and Ferber were dangled in front of me.  I<br/>
knew I wouldn&#39;t do that &#39;crying it out&#39; thing but I was desperate for sleep.<br/>
I also knew I wanted to follow his lead in what he needed.  I would go to<br/>
the grocery store w/ my son at night and vague acquaintances would actually<br/>
come up to me and talk to me about how I needed to get him into a routine.<br/>
I suppose I looked like shit and so it wasn&#39;t hard for people to figure they<br/>
were doing me a favor.  I think I was at my nadir of my life as a mother at<br/>
that point.<br/>
<br/>
I went to our pediatricians wondering if he had some advice.  He said, &#39; I&#39;<br/>
look at you and see a tired mother.  If I saw a psychotically exhausted<br/>
mother I might suggest some sleep training.  But I look at your son and see<br/>
such a happy boy.  I say continue what you&#39;re doing.  He&#39;ll get all the<br/>
sleep he needs unless of course you&#39;re having  wild parties every night.&quot;  I<br/>
assured him we weren&#39;t,  That was just the support I needed to continue<br/>
following his lead and I was very thankful for it.<br/>
<br/>
Now he goes to bed around midnight.  I often get into bed before him while<br/>
he plays or watches some TV but bc he wants to go to sleep with us and have<br/>
some pillow talk, he comes in and we go to sleep together.  If he didn&#39;t<br/>
want to go to sleep w/ us I&#39;m not sure what I would do.  It&#39;s easy for me to<br/>
say he follows his own cycles but really only up until they collide with dh<br/>
and mine.  After about 12:30, I&#39;ve just got to go to sleep.  We let him know<br/>
what we need to which I do think helps in the equation.  He sleeps until<br/>
about 9: 30.  This works for me since I&#39;m not a morning person and god love<br/>
him, he still often naps in the afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve thought is for some reason many people extend trust to their<br/>
babies but some cultural pressure comes in for some reason around 2.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know why.  I guess time to put childish things away or something.<br/>
<br/>
My problem now is my own sleep problems.  For  years I&#39;ve gotten up for 2<br/>
hrs every night.  Ds is an active sleeper so that&#39;s part of it bc I&#39;ve<br/>
always been a light sleeper but the other is I just wake up.  Bing.  Awake.<br/>
Not anxious.  I get up and read.  I&#39;ve tried so many herbal, homeopathic<br/>
remedies.  Have occasionally resorted to drugs.  I take natural progesterone<br/>
and estrogen and thyroid.  Nothing seems to touch it.  I do believe I would<br/>
be a much happier person if I could get more than 6 1/2 hrs consistently.<br/>
When I go back to bed, sleep is often then in patches of a few hrs  and then<br/>
another few hrs.  I&#39;m not a deep sleeper so things wake me.  I control the<br/>
environment as best I ca to induce sleep (dark, quiet). I need about 8 on a<br/>
regular basis and haven&#39;t had that for about 6 years.  I could be exercising<br/>
more.  That&#39;s the one thing I don&#39;t do except maybe walk quickly around the<br/>
circumference  at the park if Ds is involved in something.  Any thoughts on<br/>
this would would very appreciated?  My fear is that I&#39;ve tried it all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s what we do.  My DS is now 5 and for about the last year he&#39;s <br/>
really been into watching TV/movies before bed.  Our bedrooms are <br/>
upstairs with just a dinky square-shaped hallway in between.  We have a <br/>
TV, VCR, and DVD and a futon in the small bedroom straight across the <br/>
hall from the one we sleep in.  Little by little he was staying up <br/>
later than I possibly could and I&#39;d doze off for a few minutes in my <br/>
bed while he watched TV.  I&#39;m a very light sleeper also so if he was <br/>
having any difficulty I&#39;d hear him and wake right up.  He often doesn&#39;t <br/>
stay up for long after I&#39;ve gotten in bed and will shut off the TV and <br/>
the light before climbing into his bed.  I didn&#39;t &quot;plan&quot; to do <br/>
this....it just sort of evolved after a while.  Maybe you could try <br/>
something similar?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Alison, when this started happening to me it was during pregnancy and <br/>
my midwife suggested that I eat some protein and then go back to bed.  <br/>
A protein bar, a peanut butter sandwich, a Tofurky (or turkey) <br/>
sandwich, etc.  I was skeptical at best, but the next time I popped <br/>
awake for no &quot;apparent&quot; reason I tried the protein thing and it worked! <br/>
  You don&#39;t have to be pregnant for this to work, of course.  ;)  Since <br/>
you have 4 kids that are close together in age I&#39;m going to guess that <br/>
you&#39;ve been pregnant and/or nursing for the past 6 years and that can <br/>
take a lot out of our bodies.  Try eating some protein before bed or if <br/>
you wake up in the night and see if that makes a difference for you.  <br/>
It couldn&#39;t hurt!  :)<br/>

<br/>
Yes, exercise! It might make a big difference and even if it doesn&#39;t, <br/>
it&#39;s still a good thing. <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be anything particular. I&#39;m a big fan of just <br/>
doing a day&#39;s work energetically--jump down to the floor to pick up a <br/>
toy, do a sit up and jump to your feet, run across the room to pick <br/>
it up. Dance around instead of walking...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found a great exercise class for me with good babysitting and I <br/>
feel much better than when I wasn&#39;t working out. Lots of gyms have <br/>
classes and what I do is Jazzercise. If money is an issue, you can <br/>
offer to be a babysitter for some of the classes in exchange for free <br/>
classes!<br/>

have to be grueling, but it has to be mildly strenuous. I go to Curves <br/>
- that does it - I sleep great.  This works even if I go to Curves at 7 <br/>
am  - it still drastically changes how I sleep that night - much deeper <br/>
and more restful sleep.<br/>

Because, by then, most are in daycare. That means they have to be up,  <br/>
dressed, fed and &quot;dropped off&quot; by 7:00----so that mom can be at work by 8:00.  There<br/>
&#39;s also a need to start scheduling sleep and bedtimes for that first day  of <br/>
school that&#39;s just around the corner. If they&#39;re not in bed by 8:00,  they&#39;ll <br/>
NEVER get their 10 hours of sleep so that they&#39;ll be rested and alert  for the <br/>
teacher the next day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220574309">I have basically lived your same story by following my 3 y/o&#39;s <br/>
natural sleep patterns. Not as long as you mind you. Several things <br/>
have helped me to get back to sleep. There is a natural homeopathic <br/>
essential oil called Peace & Calming. Young Living is the brand. My <br/>
friend orders it for me. I am not sure of the manufacturer. It is <br/>
pure essential oils (used topically) that &quot;miraculously&quot; (wish I <br/>
understood this stuff) help you to not start ruminating yourself <br/>
awake during these wakeful periods. I have found that if I awaken and <br/>
start THINKING, I am awake for a couple of hours.<br/>
<br/>
The peace and calming helps-somehow, I just relax back to sleep. <br/>
Basically 80-90% of the time it works. If something really needs to <br/>
be decided, I have found that the undisturbed time to think is most <br/>
valuable. Undisturbed time to think does NOT occur in our house at <br/>
this time while ds is awake! So changing my opinion of the <br/>
wakefulness has also helped. My friend likes to get up and organize <br/>
closets, read etc. when she awakens. I NEED to sleep, though.<br/>
<br/>
We have a HEPA air cleaner in our sleeping room and the white noise <br/>
helps too.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207615473">Alison,<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever tried self hypnosis tapes or brain sync tapes that will place<br/>
you in a deeper sleep. I know I too have the same problem you describe and<br/>
added to that is the a fact that it can take up to an hour or more to<br/>
actually relax enough to fall asleep, so alot of times I feel sleep deprived<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, my answer that helped was listening to self hypnosis and brain sync<br/>
tapes that helps to calm my mind and place me into sleep and into a deeper<br/>
sleep than that of a light sleep that I was so used to having.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that is helps! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816990555">Hi Alison,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have no advice about the sleeping issue. to be honest the thought my dd<br/>
being up with my until 12 or 1230 almost causes a cold sweat for me. I need<br/>
that time for me and she is so rangy in the evening that she does not leave<br/>
me alone at all. So it doesn&#39;t work for me and if is perceived as<br/>
disrespectful to put my need for some time alone top of my list so I am a<br/>
happy mama that doesn&#39;t snap and bitch at my kid all day. well I am learning<br/>
to be ok with that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say that my dh sleeps just like you. At about 4 hour<br/>
stretches at time max, although he is going through a very good faze right<br/>
now through the help of getting his adrenals in line, using chiropractic and<br/>
EFT to resolve some old issues and he is sleeping better. He does prefer<br/>
BLACK dark, like he likes it if he can&#39;t tell if his eyes are open or not<br/>
except for what he knows. and quiet. Both of which he can&#39;t get with my and<br/>
dd as I have serious fear of the dark issues I am working on with EFT also.<br/>
It was reassuring to me to hear you also slept in a similar way since I had<br/>
never met anyone else like him before and thought it was just him. I hope<br/>
you find some way to get more sleep if you need it nothing worse than being<br/>
tired in my books,<br/>

This is my first post here but I guess I&#39;ll just jump right in.  The area of<br/>
bedtimes was one of the easier ones for me.  We&#39;ve all got our places where<br/>
it was hard to let go.  My son is 4 1/2.  When he was a baby, as most of us<br/>
probably did, he followed his need for sleep.  When he was almost 2, there<br/>
was a strange cultural phenomenon that seemed to occur: a strong bias for<br/>
starting schedules for children.  Everywhere I seemed to look people were<br/>
saying how important it was for your child to have them asleep by a certain<br/>
time.  They said they didn&#39;t get the right kind of sleep unless they went to<br/>
bed by a certain hour.  We co slept and he woke many times and I was<br/>
exhausted.  The names Weissbluth and Ferber were dangled in front of me.  I<br/>
knew I wouldn&#39;t do that &#39;crying it out&#39; thing but I was desperate for sleep.<br/>
I also knew I wanted to follow his lead in what he needed.  I would go to<br/>
the grocery store w/ my son at night and vague acquaintances would actually<br/>
come up to me and talk to me about how I needed to get him into a routine.<br/>
I suppose I looked like shit and so it wasn&#39;t hard for people to figure they<br/>
were doing me a favor.  I think I was at my nadir of my life as a mother at<br/>
that point.<br/>
<br/>
I went to our pediatricians wondering if he had some advice.  He said, &#39; I&#39;<br/>
look at you and see a tired mother.  If I saw a psychotically exhausted<br/>
mother I might suggest some sleep training.  But I look at your son and see<br/>
such a happy boy.  I say continue what you&#39;re doing.  He&#39;ll get all the<br/>
sleep he needs unless of course you&#39;re having  wild parties every night.&quot;  I<br/>
assured him we weren&#39;t,  That was just the support I needed to continue<br/>
following his lead and I was very thankful for it.<br/>
<br/>
Now he goes to bed around midnight.  I often get into bed before him while<br/>
he plays or watches some TV but bc he wants to go to sleep with us and have<br/>
some pillow talk, he comes in and we go to sleep together.  If he didn&#39;t<br/>
want to go to sleep w/ us I&#39;m not sure what I would do.  It&#39;s easy for me to<br/>
say he follows his own cycles but really only up until they collide with dh<br/>
and mine.  After about 12:30, I&#39;ve just got to go to sleep.  We let him know<br/>
what we need to which I do think helps in the equation.  He sleeps until<br/>
about 9: 30.  This works for me since I&#39;m not a morning person and god love<br/>
him, he still often naps in the afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve thought is for some reason many people extend trust to their<br/>
babies but some cultural pressure comes in for some reason around 2.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know why.  I guess time to put childish things away or something.<br/>
<br/>
My problem now is my own sleep problems.  For  years I&#39;ve gotten up for 2<br/>
hrs every night.  Ds is an active sleeper so that&#39;s part of it bc I&#39;ve<br/>
always been a light sleeper but the other is I just wake up.  Bing.  Awake.<br/>
Not anxious.  I get up and read.  I&#39;ve tried so many herbal, homeopathic<br/>
remedies.  Have occasionally resorted to drugs.  I take natural progesterone<br/>
and estrogen and thyroid.  Nothing seems to touch it.  I do believe I would<br/>
be a much happier person if I could get more than 6 1/2 hrs consistently.<br/>
When I go back to bed, sleep is often then in patches of a few hrs  and then<br/>
another few hrs.  I&#39;m not a deep sleeper so things wake me.  I control the<br/>
environment as best I ca to induce sleep (dark, quiet). I need about 8 on a<br/>
regular basis and haven&#39;t had that for about 6 years.  I could be exercising<br/>
more.  That&#39;s the one thing I don&#39;t do except maybe walk quickly around the<br/>
circumference  at the park if Ds is involved in something.  Any thoughts on<br/>
this would would very appreciated?  My fear is that I&#39;ve tried it all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663228739">I know I&#39;m way behind here and want to apologize for not getting back<br/>
sooner.  My Mom was in the hospital and it&#39;s been a hellish time. Just<br/>
waiting to find out.<br/>
<br/>
Those were some great ideas for helping me sleep.  Some I do like making<br/>
sure I eat protein before bed.  But others I hadn&#39;t tried so I ordered the<br/>
Young Living oil.  If the person who mentioned this would email me privately<br/>
I&#39;d appreciate it.  And the Mind Sync tape I&#39;m going to order.  We&#39;ll see.<br/>
I always have high hopes.  So thank you.  And yes you have gotten me to go<br/>
up and down the stairs if I haven&#39;t had a real output of work out type<br/>
energy that day.  If I missed anyone, I&quot;m sorry.  I really appreciated all<br/>
the suggestions.<br/>
