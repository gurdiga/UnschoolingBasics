<div id="ygrps-yiv-304235926">Hi, everyone!  I&#39;m Michelle, mom to a 15yodd and 11yods.  I am a full-time college student pursuing a double major in History and Humanities.  I should be done by the end of this year.  We are a military family (Navy) stationed in Naples, Italy.  I&#39;ve been homeschooling for 8 years and have just recently (like in the last week or two) started unschooling.  I&#39;ve been reading tons and trying to find out as much as I can but some things just still seem unclear to me.  I do have to say, though, that as soon as we started doing this, I felt a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.  No more spending hours scheduling, no more &quot;you have to get your schoolwork done before you can play that new educational game we got for you&quot;, no more &quot;are we doing enough?  Are they being challenged enough?  Are they being too challenged?&quot;, etc.<br/>
<br/>
First off, let me say that I have amazing, wonderful kids.  We are very close.  I brought my daughter home after 1st grade and my son has never gone to &quot;regular&quot; school.  We have amazing opportunities here in Italy.  We&#39;ve been here just over a year and have just under 2 years left.  We&#39;ve been to Rome a couple of times, Vatican City, Pompeii, and have had the best pizza, wine, cheese, and bread on the whole planet.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, onto my questions.  I&#39;ve read a few times about &quot;arbitrary&quot; bed times, time on video games and/or other things and I&#39;m wondering what that means.  Do you mean just throwing a time out there with no thoughts?  My son has a bedtime of 10:00 and my daughter of 10:30.  On weekends they have an extra 1/2 an hour.  Granted, this is a hold-over from the schooling days, so it could possibly be changed.  We sometimes let our kids have what we call &quot;movie nights&quot; or we let them stay up as late as they want.  I don&#39;t understand what can be done at 3 a.m. that can&#39;t be done a 10 a.m., but I digress.  My son is always asking &quot;can we stay up late tonight?&quot; and I honestly get tired of that question.  Kids need their rest, so I don&#39;t want to let them stay up all night - where&#39;s the balance?<br/>
<br/>
Video games.  I&#39;ve been reading the WoW thread with interest.  I do have to say that my viewpoint on video games has changed just since being on this list for a few days.  I was one of those moms that hated video games.  We have a 360, Wii, 2 DSs and 2 PSPs.  My kids were allowed to play only on the weekends and only if they got their schoolwork and chores done during the week.  However, after reading quite a few of these posts, I&#39;ve done a complete 180.  My son wants to be a video game designer and it&#39;s like a lightbulb went off when I read something about pursuing what they&#39;re passionate in and helping them develop the skills that they want to pursue.  I was almost like &quot;Duh!&quot; if he wants to do that for a living he needs to see how the various engines work, etc.  So now, hubby and I are trying to decide, again, where the balance is.  On the weekends, he literally plays from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed (unless we&#39;d like to watch something on tv - the tv in the living room is the only one with the game systems on it).  They also have iPods that they download various television shows on (Mythbusters, Mystery Diagnosis).  I&#39;m guessing that he probably plays so much on the weekends because that is the only time he gets to.  He has actually said that he wants to get in as much time as he can on the weekends because its (to him) such a short time.  So, we&#39;d like to give him more access, but how much?<br/>
<br/>
Chores.  I&#39;ve only been on here a few days so I&#39;ve not read anything about chores.  I have some medical issues and some days I just can not do a lot.  Right now we have a chore list but after a while of doing the same chores they get bored.  I can understand.  They&#39;ve also come to realize that there are some things that they just don&#39;t like doing as far as chores go.  How do you handle chores?  A list?  Let them do what they want?  My dd - I hate to say it - but she is quite lazy and will walk over a pile of dirty clothes rather than put it in the hamper or, God forbid, throw it in the washing machine.  We told her a year or so back that we would not tell her how to keep her room.  If she chose to clean it, fine, if not, fine.  The only stipulation we put on that is she couldn&#39;t leave food/dishes (bugs) in the room and we&#39;d like her to pick up her laundry and put it in the laundry room because after a while it starts to smell.  Other than that we&#39;ve got various chores from folding a load of laundry to emptying the dishwasher, etc.  How do you handle chores?<br/>
<br/>
I am asking these questions seriously as I would like to know how to &quot;do this right&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually it&#39;s an important question. And the reason you aren&#39;t seeing  <br/>
the answer is that you know what the answer is for you and can&#39;t  <br/>
understand why or how it could be any different for anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are night owls. If you read here long enough, you&#39;ll hear  <br/>
stories of adults who were sent to bed at bed time and tried each  <br/>
night to sleep but just couldn&#39;t. They&#39;d lie there *every night*  <br/>
until 1 or 2 when *their* bodies wanted to sleep. As much as their  <br/>
parents tried to make them be the way the parents thought was right,  <br/>
it just didn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s body is naturally on a different schedule, 10 AM to them  <br/>
is like 2 AM to you. Their energy and mental gears are going on a  <br/>
different schedule. You might be zippiest at 11 AM and winding down  <br/>
at 8 PM. What if your body felt differently. What if you were  <br/>
naturally zippy at 8 PM and draggy at 11 AM and your husband dragged  <br/>
you around at 11AM to get things done when you were drained and sat  <br/>
down for a relaxing evening at 8 PM for reading or TV and you were  <br/>
ready to dance?<br/>
<br/>
If you read here long enough, you&#39;ll see that body clocks are what  <br/>
they are and no amount of external force can change them. People can  <br/>
*choose* to adapt *themselves*. If they really want a job that starts  <br/>
at 8AM, they can find ways to function. Or they can find a night job.  <br/>
But it&#39;s not something someone can impose on them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kids need their rest, so I don&#39;t want to let them stay up all night  <br/>
&gt; - where&#39;s the balance?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What would happen if they stayed up all night?<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;d sleep later.<br/>
<br/>
If people need something, they find a way to get it.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re looking too short term. While sleep is a good thing, that  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean rigidly in bed at 10 PM for 8 hours each night gives  <br/>
someone a ticket to health. Kids *will* push their boundaries to find  <br/>
out their limits. They will push their boundaries when something even  <br/>
better is making it worth putting up with some negatives. For  <br/>
instance, staying up all night to play a new video game will be  <br/>
*well* worth giving up sleep for. But this isn&#39;t going to damage  <br/>
their health. Eventually what the game returns won&#39;t be fascinating  <br/>
enough to overcome the tiredness. This shouldn&#39;t be seen as a lesson  <br/>
learned so won&#39;t ever happen again. The goal isn&#39;t to teach them  <br/>
sleep is important. The goal is to remove the obstacles that get in  <br/>
the way of sleep. But sometimes they *will* choose to give up sleep  <br/>
when there&#39;s something more important going on. The trick is not to  <br/>
create things that seem more important by making staying up late be  <br/>
something desired.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t helping them get enough sleep. You&#39;ve changed  <br/>
the problem into getting them to sleep at the time you&#39;ve chosen. And  <br/>
you&#39;re treating the two problems (enough sleep, sleeping at 10 PM) as  <br/>
though they were the same.<br/>
<br/>
Where things go wrong for new unschoolers is that they hear &quot;let them  <br/>
sleep when they&#39;re tired&quot; and they let go of bedtimes. What happens  <br/>
is: 1) the kids are so jazzed at not having to sleep that they push  <br/>
themselves to exhaustion and have a hard time falling asleep and 2)  <br/>
the kids are up at 2 AM while the parents sleep and the mom is  <br/>
uncomfortable with that (or the kids get loud at night and wake  <br/>
everyone) and she doesn&#39;t know what to do.<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to help them figure out what sleepy feels like and help  <br/>
them fall asleep when they choose to. To do that you remove the  <br/>
obstacles and artificial reasons that are driving them to want to  <br/>
fight sleep. That doesn&#39;t mean that they will always choose to sleep  <br/>
when sleepy. It means that they will be able to recognize when  <br/>
they&#39;re tired and then be able to decide for this moment whether  <br/>
staying up is more important than sleep. Right now they aren&#39;t  <br/>
learning how to choose. They&#39;re learning that the clock (and parents)  <br/>
dictate when sleep happens.<br/>
<br/>
*One* way is to wind down the house starting at 8. Lower lights. Do  <br/>
quieter things. Get a routine in. Bath. Reading. But don&#39;t make sleep  <br/>
mandatory. The goal is to wind the house down so others can sleep if  <br/>
they want to.<br/>
<br/>
That is *not* a formula for success. ;-) It works well in some homes,  <br/>
and fails in others. It depends on your kids. *Some* families find a  <br/>
mintramp set up in front of the TV or wherever the family is gathered  <br/>
helps the kids get the zings out of their system. Obviously the total  <br/>
opposite of the above ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There are *lots* of techniques that families try out for size. If you  <br/>
type bedtime into the archive search of the list, you&#39;ll find lots.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; where&#39;s the balance?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where&#39;s the balance? Inside of them trying to find its own way.<br/>
<br/>
Think of the balance of riding a bike. You can ride with them as  <br/>
littles on the back of your bike but you can&#39;t give them your  <br/>
balance. The only way they can find their own is to do it on their  <br/>
own and try a lot of different things until they find what&#39;s right  <br/>
*for them*. And then, and only then, do they ride.<br/>
<br/>
Sleep balance, and lots of other balances like food and video game  <br/>
playing, are a bit different. There isn&#39;t just one way of doing it  <br/>
and sometimes the balance will only be seen in the long term, not the  <br/>
short term. I think the more useful question in terms of creating an  <br/>
environment where they can explore freely without balance chaining  <br/>
them to a single answer is &quot;How can we balance family life with free  <br/>
exploration?&quot; In terms of mindful parenting and unschooling, your  <br/>
goal isn&#39;t to find their balance for them, but to make the  <br/>
environment safe for them to explore in, and help them find options  <br/>
that don&#39;t trample on the toes of others. Give them the freedom to  <br/>
find their own balance.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My son is always asking &quot;can we stay up late tonight?&quot; and I  <br/>
&gt; honestly get tired of that question.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is where you&#39;re setting yourself up for greater difficulties if  <br/>
you want to shift your goal to helping them sleep when they&#39;re tired  <br/>
instead of making them sleep on the schedule  you think is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re creating staying up as a really cool desirable thing. If you  <br/>
were to let them stay up they&#39;d want to stay up later and later and  <br/>
all night even because it&#39;s this wonderful thing you&#39;re handing out  <br/>
in rare bits like diamonds.<br/>
<br/>
When kids know they can choose to stay up late any night they want,  <br/>
it loses its luster. So if the reason they want to stay up is because  <br/>
you&#39;re making it into a treat, when they know they can stay up any  <br/>
night they want, it&#39;s not a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
But *don&#39;t* just remove bedtimes for a free for all! It&#39;s a recipe  <br/>
for disaster. Read in the archives for other ideas.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well you can&#39;t decide what&#39;s balance for him. You can though make the  <br/>
environment pleasant for him (and the rest of the family!) for him to  <br/>
explore freely. In the process he will find a balance. The balance  <br/>
will change over time. Right now, the balance is to suck in as much  <br/>
as he can. That *will* level off, though not on your schedule. Let go  <br/>
of expecting him to play only to the point where you think he&#39;s had  <br/>
enough. His balance may always be off of what you expect. But he  <br/>
won&#39;t be playing 12 hours a day for the rest of his life. He *will*  <br/>
find a balance if you&#39;re not pushing and pulling at him to impose  <br/>
your idea of balance on him.<br/>
<br/>
And, again, this is where we&#39;re miscommunicating. Creating an  <br/>
environment for him to freely explore in doesn&#39;t mean releasing him  <br/>
to the TV and waiting for him to resurface. Stay connected to him.  <br/>
Play with him for a while. (It doesn&#39;t mean as long as he does! Play  <br/>
for enjoyment and play to help you understand what fascinates him so  <br/>
much). Talk about the games. Buy gaming guides. Help him find  <br/>
walkthroughs. Bring him food.<br/>
<br/>
Involve him in family plans. Treat the gaming seriously as though he  <br/>
were working on Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem. When he feels that you&#39;re  <br/>
helping him do what involves him he won&#39;t need to fight to get the  <br/>
time to do it. When he feels you&#39;re helping him, he&#39;ll have the  <br/>
ability to help you by making some accommodations for the rest of the  <br/>
family. (This might take longer than you&#39;d think. If he&#39;s had to  <br/>
struggle to get what he wants, if you now start helping him and  <br/>
treating his interests seriously, he&#39;s not going to *feel* the trust  <br/>
for a good long while. You have to rebuild it. And rebuilding trust  <br/>
requires being trustworthy for a good long while.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway what I was going to say is involve him in making family plans.  <br/>
If there&#39;s a dentist appointment at 10, approach it with &quot;Let&#39;s see  <br/>
how we can make this work so both can fit in,&quot; rather than the  <br/>
standard parenting practice of making the kid stop the trivial  <br/>
playing for the important adult imposed things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On the weekends, he literally plays from the moment he wakes up  <br/>
&gt; until he goes to bed (unless we&#39;d like to watch something on tv -  <br/>

&gt;  room is the only one with the game systems on it).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d seriously consider getting another TV for the games if it&#39;s a  <br/>
problem. Kids can&#39;t choose to watch TV with the family if the choice  <br/>
is made for them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m guessing that he probably plays so much on the weekends because  <br/>
&gt; that is the only time he gets to.  He has actually said that he  <br/>

&gt; (to him) such a short time.  So, we&#39;d like to give him more access,  <br/>
&gt; but how much?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, you&#39;re creating a rare commodity for him. If kids are given an  <br/>
hour of TV each day, very likely they will watch for that hour  <br/>
whether they love the program or not and try to squeeze out even more  <br/>
because that time is so rare and precious. When kids are given the  <br/>
freedom to turn on the TV, they can choose not to watch because there  <br/>
isn&#39;t anything they want to watch. TV is just another choice in their  <br/>
life like books and crafting and skateboarding.<br/>

Pam Sorooshian wrote a really good post on this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.html">http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.html</a><br/>
<br/>
There are certain ages, usually transition ages when kids brains are  <br/>
shifting and seeing the world in a new way, when they can watch a lot  <br/>
of TV (and play a lot of video games). Preteenish is the biggest. The  <br/>
&quot;middle school&quot; years. (Interestingly, teachers see this as sort of a  <br/>
holding pen time. The kids are transitioning and there isn&#39;t one  <br/>
right thing to do with them. So they kind of just hold on and go  <br/>
through the motions until the kids are released into high school ;-)  <br/>
My daughter watched a *lot* of TV then and played a lot of games. She  <br/>
was between kid interests and more grown up interests and feeling out  <br/>
the new possibilities. Which *looked* like doing nothing but it was  <br/>
all internal rearrangement work. It *is* a hard period for parents!<br/>
<br/>
But they do come out of it. At 17 she doesn&#39;t have enough time in her  <br/>
busy schedule to keep the DVR free ;-)<br/>
<br/>
What helped was getting a DVR so that she could set it to record the  <br/>
programs she wanted. That way she didn&#39;t feel chained to the TV by  <br/>
the station&#39;s schedule.<br/>

<br/>
down the right side is stuff on chores. I&#39;ve gathered a lot of the  <br/>
most common questions and answers to them. You may still have  <br/>
questions after but I won&#39;t have to recreate the entire foundation ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Also:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/chores">http://www.sandradodd.com/chores</a><br/>
<br/>
If you have medical issues I think the greatest gift you can give the  <br/>
family is finding ways to simplify the tasks so there&#39;s less work.  <br/>
This gets easier as you get going because you start breaking down  <br/>
&quot;rules of how things must be&quot; that you didn&#39;t even know were there! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
As an example of out of the box thinking, one family stored their  <br/>
clothes where the washer is.<br/>
<br/>
Another out of the box idea is that one family only kept in daily  <br/>
circulation enough dishes for one meal. That way the dishes to be  <br/>
washed couldn&#39;t pile up.<br/>
<br/>
Another is large bins where kids play so that toys can be tossed in  <br/>
very easily.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t a simple solution to chores. It&#39;s a lot of shifting of  <br/>
mental attitude, looking at things in new ways, seeing that  <br/>
conventional ways often solve the immediate problem (a temporarily  <br/>
clean room) but create larger problems in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My dd - I hate to say it - but she is quite lazy and will walk over  <br/>
&gt; a pile of dirty clothes rather than put it in the hamper or, God  <br/>
&gt; forbid, throw it in the washing machine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It *really* helps to view this in a different way. It tears down  <br/>
relationships to see a child or a spouse in negative light when  <br/>
they&#39;re just different.<br/>
<br/>
The real definition of lazy is someone who isn&#39;t meeting someone  <br/>
else&#39;s standards or expectations.<br/>
<br/>
*I* step over stuff. Not because I&#39;m lazy but because I have more  <br/>
important things to do or because I&#39;m so focused on something else  <br/>
that I don&#39;t see it.<br/>
<br/>
Treat her as though she really can&#39;t see the clothes. At this moment  <br/>
they&#39;re beneath her radar. You can&#39;t change her radar. Age will do  <br/>
that. In the meantime you can just add unpleasantness to her life in  <br/>
the quest to change her.<br/>
<br/>
If you see her setting a glass down on the counter, just say  <br/>
&quot;Dishwasher.&quot; If you see her drop her pants, just say &quot;Hamper.&quot; Trust  <br/>
that she isn&#39;t trying to make your life more difficult. She&#39;s just  <br/>
not able to see what you do because she&#39;s not an adult. She&#39;s focused  <br/>
with kid vision and only age will change that.<br/>

And Scott Noelle&#39;s Daily Groove. This is by email. It&#39;s *short*. Each  <br/>
takes less than a minute a day to read. But he&#39;s really good at  <br/>
getting some profound changes in perspective across in a few words.<br/>
<br/>
www.enjoyparenting.com/dailygroove<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We told her a year or so back that we would not tell her how to  <br/>
&gt; keep her room.  If she chose to clean it, fine, if not, fine.  The  <br/>
&gt; only stipulation we put on that is she couldn&#39;t leave food/dishes  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s helpful for a relationship for kids rooms to belong to  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s also helpful to offer to clean it up for them  <br/>
occasionally when the muse strikes you. Kids can easily create a mess  <br/>
that&#39;s overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
I could literally see the change in the way my daughter viewed  <br/>
turning chaos into order as she moved into her preteen years. I would  <br/>
sometimes ask if she&#39;d match socks or fold kitchen towels and it was  <br/>
like I asked her to run a marathon. But we let it go. What looked to  <br/>
us like a small task was to her large. We just asked and as she got  <br/>
older I could see that her brain was making new connections and it  <br/>
became easy for her.<br/>
<br/>
A few times the house has gotten to the point where I don&#39;t know what  <br/>
to do first and it seems like an impossible task. I kept that feeling  <br/>
in mind whenever I asked her to do something that *to me* looked  <br/>
simple, I accepted that to her it looked like a whole house disaster.  <br/>
But at 17 she&#39;s perfectly capable of tackling a room and sending  <br/>
things off to their proper places or finding new ways of storing  <br/>
them. Not because I trained her for 17 years but because I let her  <br/>
mature enough to be able to do it and treated her time with respect  <br/>
and didn&#39;t make her.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s much easier to maintain ownership of retrieving plates. *Do*  <br/>
ask if she could make a sweep, but make it your thing that you ask  <br/>
her help with. She really, literally, can&#39;t care about bugs the way  <br/>
you can. It can&#39;t be as important to her because she still thinks in  <br/>
kid ways. Another way is to make this an if/then deal. She can eat in  <br/>
her room if she brings the plates out. If she can&#39;t remember, she  <br/>
needs to eat in the kitchen. That&#39;s a hard concept to explain because  <br/>
it sounds like conventional parenting. It&#39;s *not* a rule. Eating only  <br/>
in the kitchen is *not* a punishment. It&#39;s just the deal. It&#39;s a  <br/>
&quot;Yes, you can if ...&quot; Let her test her ability periodically. She will  <br/>
get older and better able to remember.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-801818537">Joyce, I find your answers are to these questions very enlightening.  Can<br/>
you recommend any reading material on the topic of radical unschooling?  My<br/>
son is 6 and we are homeschooling.  I consider that we give him a lot of<br/>
room to be, but I know we hold on to a fair number of prescribed ways of<br/>
being that we find difficult to shake.  Thanks again for your thoughtful and<br/>
insightful responses.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Okay, onto my questions. I&#39;ve read a few times about &quot;arbitrary&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; bed times, time on video games and/or other things and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; wondering what that means. Do you mean just throwing a time out<br/>
&gt; &gt; there with no thoughts? My son has a bedtime of 10:00 and my<br/>
&gt; &gt; daughter of 10:30. On weekends they have an extra 1/2 an hour.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Granted, this is a hold-over from the schooling days, so it could<br/>
&gt; &gt; possibly be changed. We sometimes let our kids have what we call<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;movie nights&quot; or we let them stay up as late as they want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t understand what can be done at 3 a.m. that can&#39;t be done a<br/>
&gt; &gt; 10 a.m., but I digress.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually it&#39;s an important question. And the reason you aren&#39;t seeing<br/>
&gt; the answer is that you know what the answer is for you and can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; understand why or how it could be any different for anyone else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people are night owls. If you read here long enough, you&#39;ll hear<br/>
&gt; stories of adults who were sent to bed at bed time and tried each<br/>
&gt; night to sleep but just couldn&#39;t. They&#39;d lie there *every night*<br/>
&gt; until 1 or 2 when *their* bodies wanted to sleep. As much as their<br/>
&gt; parents tried to make them be the way the parents thought was right,<br/>
&gt; it just didn&#39;t work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If someone&#39;s body is naturally on a different schedule, 10 AM to them<br/>
&gt; is like 2 AM to you. Their energy and mental gears are going on a<br/>
&gt; different schedule. You might be zippiest at 11 AM and winding down<br/>
&gt; at 8 PM. What if your body felt differently. What if you were<br/>
&gt; naturally zippy at 8 PM and draggy at 11 AM and your husband dragged<br/>
&gt; you around at 11AM to get things done when you were drained and sat<br/>
&gt; down for a relaxing evening at 8 PM for reading or TV and you were<br/>
&gt; ready to dance?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you read here long enough, you&#39;ll see that body clocks are what<br/>
&gt; they are and no amount of external force can change them. People can<br/>
&gt; *choose* to adapt *themselves*. If they really want a job that starts<br/>
&gt; at 8AM, they can find ways to function. Or they can find a night job.<br/>
&gt; But it&#39;s not something someone can impose on them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kids need their rest, so I don&#39;t want to let them stay up all night<br/>
&gt; &gt; - where&#39;s the balance?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What would happen if they stayed up all night?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They&#39;d sleep later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If people need something, they find a way to get it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You&#39;re looking too short term. While sleep is a good thing, that<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t mean rigidly in bed at 10 PM for 8 hours each night gives<br/>
&gt; someone a ticket to health. Kids *will* push their boundaries to find<br/>
&gt; out their limits. They will push their boundaries when something even<br/>
&gt; better is making it worth putting up with some negatives. For<br/>
&gt; instance, staying up all night to play a new video game will be<br/>
&gt; *well* worth giving up sleep for. But this isn&#39;t going to damage<br/>
&gt; their health. Eventually what the game returns won&#39;t be fascinating<br/>
&gt; enough to overcome the tiredness. This shouldn&#39;t be seen as a lesson<br/>
&gt; learned so won&#39;t ever happen again. The goal isn&#39;t to teach them<br/>
&gt; sleep is important. The goal is to remove the obstacles that get in<br/>
&gt; the way of sleep. But sometimes they *will* choose to give up sleep<br/>
&gt; when there&#39;s something more important going on. The trick is not to<br/>
&gt; create things that seem more important by making staying up late be<br/>
&gt; something desired.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t helping them get enough sleep. You&#39;ve changed<br/>
&gt; the problem into getting them to sleep at the time you&#39;ve chosen. And<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re treating the two problems (enough sleep, sleeping at 10 PM) as<br/>
&gt; though they were the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where things go wrong for new unschoolers is that they hear &quot;let them<br/>
&gt; sleep when they&#39;re tired&quot; and they let go of bedtimes. What happens<br/>
&gt; is: 1) the kids are so jazzed at not having to sleep that they push<br/>
&gt; themselves to exhaustion and have a hard time falling asleep and 2)<br/>
&gt; the kids are up at 2 AM while the parents sleep and the mom is<br/>
&gt; uncomfortable with that (or the kids get loud at night and wake<br/>
&gt; everyone) and she doesn&#39;t know what to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The goal is to help them figure out what sleepy feels like and help<br/>
&gt; them fall asleep when they choose to. To do that you remove the<br/>
&gt; obstacles and artificial reasons that are driving them to want to<br/>
&gt; fight sleep. That doesn&#39;t mean that they will always choose to sleep<br/>
&gt; when sleepy. It means that they will be able to recognize when<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re tired and then be able to decide for this moment whether<br/>
&gt; staying up is more important than sleep. Right now they aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; learning how to choose. They&#39;re learning that the clock (and parents)<br/>
&gt; dictate when sleep happens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *One* way is to wind down the house starting at 8. Lower lights. Do<br/>
&gt; quieter things. Get a routine in. Bath. Reading. But don&#39;t make sleep<br/>
&gt; mandatory. The goal is to wind the house down so others can sleep if<br/>
&gt; they want to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That is *not* a formula for success. ;-) It works well in some homes,<br/>
&gt; and fails in others. It depends on your kids. *Some* families find a<br/>
&gt; mintramp set up in front of the TV or wherever the family is gathered<br/>
&gt; helps the kids get the zings out of their system. Obviously the total<br/>
&gt; opposite of the above ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are *lots* of techniques that families try out for size. If you<br/>
&gt; type bedtime into the archive search of the list, you&#39;ll find lots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; where&#39;s the balance?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where&#39;s the balance? Inside of them trying to find its own way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Think of the balance of riding a bike. You can ride with them as<br/>
&gt; littles on the back of your bike but you can&#39;t give them your<br/>
&gt; balance. The only way they can find their own is to do it on their<br/>
&gt; own and try a lot of different things until they find what&#39;s right<br/>
&gt; *for them*. And then, and only then, do they ride.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sleep balance, and lots of other balances like food and video game<br/>
&gt; playing, are a bit different. There isn&#39;t just one way of doing it<br/>
&gt; and sometimes the balance will only be seen in the long term, not the<br/>
&gt; short term. I think the more useful question in terms of creating an<br/>
&gt; environment where they can explore freely without balance chaining<br/>
&gt; them to a single answer is &quot;How can we balance family life with free<br/>
&gt; exploration?&quot; In terms of mindful parenting and unschooling, your<br/>
&gt; goal isn&#39;t to find their balance for them, but to make the<br/>
&gt; environment safe for them to explore in, and help them find options<br/>
&gt; that don&#39;t trample on the toes of others. Give them the freedom to<br/>
&gt; find their own balance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My son is always asking &quot;can we stay up late tonight?&quot; and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; honestly get tired of that question.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is where you&#39;re setting yourself up for greater difficulties if<br/>
&gt; you want to shift your goal to helping them sleep when they&#39;re tired<br/>
&gt; instead of making them sleep on the schedule you think is necessary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You&#39;re creating staying up as a really cool desirable thing. If you<br/>
&gt; were to let them stay up they&#39;d want to stay up later and later and<br/>
&gt; all night even because it&#39;s this wonderful thing you&#39;re handing out<br/>
&gt; in rare bits like diamonds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When kids know they can choose to stay up late any night they want,<br/>
&gt; it loses its luster. So if the reason they want to stay up is because<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re making it into a treat, when they know they can stay up any<br/>
&gt; night they want, it&#39;s not a big deal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But *don&#39;t* just remove bedtimes for a free for all! It&#39;s a recipe<br/>
&gt; for disaster. Read in the archives for other ideas.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s meant to be done in the way you might remind your husband with  <br/>
whom you do want to maintain a good relationship.<br/>
<br/>
I shouldn&#39;t have said &quot;just&quot;. It&#39;s one suggestion. There are other  <br/>
techniques in:<br/>

How to Talk to Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/2zx2mf">http://tinyurl.com/2zx2mf</a><br/>
<br/>
But the goal shouldn&#39;t be to change the kids or turn them into  <br/>
extensions of the parent to do what the parent wants. The goal is to  <br/>
create a pleasant environment where they want to help. If someone  <br/>
finds something harsh or the kids find something harsh, then don&#39;t do  <br/>
it! It won&#39;t be a pleasant environment.<br/>
<br/>
Trust that kids don&#39;t want to make our lives more difficult. They  <br/>
aren&#39;t dropping clothes all over the place because they don&#39;t care  <br/>
about us. They just aren&#39;t aware yet or so focused on other things  <br/>
that they can&#39;t see what&#39;s going on.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good distinction.<br/>
<br/>
And the if/then deals should be reserved for important things to  <br/>
prevent damage or rudeness. If you live in a 4000 sq ft house packed  <br/>
to the gills where plates will disappear into a black hole or in the  <br/>
south where bugs are waiting for a dropped crumb missing plates will  <br/>
be big deal.<br/>
<br/>
If if/thens are over used they&#39;ll just be control. You want to be  <br/>
able to use them when the kids want to stay up late without the  <br/>
parents. &quot;You can stay up *if* you don&#39;t wake us.&quot; That&#39;s courtesy.  <br/>
But daily &quot;You can play video games if you clean up the room after,&quot;  <br/>
is just trying to control the kids into keeping the house to mom&#39;s  <br/>
standards.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-275205806">I have been thinking about this- what might look like  a bribe from the <br/>
outside seems to me like offering options for happiness for everyone. I <br/>
will often offer a shopping trips to my daughter when my son has an <br/>
activity in town so that she also has something to look forward to - <br/>
even if it is just $2 to spend at the craft store.  Hey, I will do that <br/>
for myself- if I am not so excited about a trip to town I will get a cup <br/>
of coffee or a new book at the library to make it more fun for myself- <br/>

Yup, especially maybe, when it looks a lot like &#39;school&#39; - some kids<br/>
(I&#39;m one of them) really LIKE workbooks, the print, the empty spaces to<br/>
fill in, etc. Even now that I&#39;m well past &quot;school age&quot; (my 30th high<br/>
school reunion is this year!), I was at a training session for something<br/>
a couple weeks ago and I made sure to fill in all the spaces in the<br/>
workbook with the proper answer (plus my own notes on the<br/>
question/related information as well). DS sitting at the table with a<br/>
penmanship workbook at age 7 would have &quot;looked&quot; like he was doing<br/>
school work. Reality was that HE requested that material because he<br/>
wanted to be able to write his name in cursive the way he had seen me do<br/>
it when signing checks. It lasted just exactly as long as he was<br/>
interested (about half an hour maybe) and it&#39;s been tucked on a shelf<br/>
since, in case he ever wants it again.<br/>

Joyce, I find your answers are to these questions very enlightening.  Can<br/>
you recommend any reading material on the topic of radical unschooling?  My<br/>
son is 6 and we are homeschooling.  I consider that we give him a lot of<br/>
room to be, but I know we hold on to a fair number of prescribed ways of<br/>
being that we find difficult to shake.  Thanks again for your thoughtful and<br/>

Joyce, I find your answers are to these questions very enlightening.  Can<br/>
you recommend any reading material on the topic of radical unschooling?  My<br/>
son is 6 and we are homeschooling.  I consider that we give him a lot of<br/>
room to be, but I know we hold on to a fair number of prescribed ways of<br/>
being that we find difficult to shake.  Thanks again for your thoughtful and<br/>
insightful responses.<br/>

From: Michelle Cloud &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cloudfamily4@...">cloudfamily4@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, onto my questions.  I&#39;ve read a few times about &quot;arbitrary&quot; bed times, <br/>
time on video games and/or other things and I&#39;m wondering what that means.  Do <br/>
you mean just throwing a time out there with no thoughts?  My son has a bedtime <br/>
of 10:00 and my daughter of 10:30.  On weekends they have an extra 1/2 an hour.  <br/>
Granted, this is a hold-over from the schooling days, so it could possibly be <br/>
changed.  We sometimes let our kids have what we call &quot;movie nights&quot; or we let <br/>
them stay up as late as they want.  I don&#39;t understand what can be done at 3 <br/>
a.m. that can&#39;t be done a 10 a.m., but I digress.  My son is always asking &quot;can <br/>
we stay up late tonight?&quot; and I honestly get tired of that question.  Kids need <br/>
their rest, so I don&#39;t want to let them stay up all night - where&#39;s the balance?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An &quot;arbitrary bedtime&quot; is when the parent decides that the child must be in bed at a certain time. It doesn&#39;t take into consideration when the child is tired---it just *is*.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have arbitrary bedtimes. The time the children are expected to be in bed is under *your* control.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that children need their rest. So do adults! But it works better for *each* body to learn to detect *when* its tired and in need of sleep. When someone else makes those decisions *for* us, we eventually can&#39;t *feel* when we&#39;re tired.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your  &quot;I don&#39;t understand what can be do<br/>
ne at 3 a.m. that can&#39;t be done a 10 a.m.&quot;  sounds as if it&#39;s right out of your parent&#39;s mouth. &lt;g&gt; Are you just regurgitating, or have you actually *thought* about it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m up now, at 5:00 am. I went to bed at 9:00 because I was tired. I have a house full of company, but I was too tired to stay up any later. Unfortunately, I awoke at 1:30, watched TV until 4:00, went back to bed and tried to go back to sleep until 4:30---and now I&#39;m UP and writing to you. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I believe that a big part of my sleep issues are because of my VERY strict bedtimes as a child. I feel that I&#39;m getting over them (that&#39;s why I *chose* to  go to bed at 9:00), but I still struggle with being IN bed and not sleeping. My parents also believed that children need rest and that parents need &quot;adult time&quot;---so I was sent to bed at 7:00 as a toddler, 7:30 as a first grader, 8:00 as a fourth grader, and 9:00 as a sixth grader. If I took an our nap in the afternoon, I was allowed to stay up one half hour later at night. Two hour nap? An hour later. By the time I was 13 or so, they couldn&#39;t control that, and I would stay up until 2:00,3:00, even 5:00 reading, but I was deliriously tired the whole next day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To me, bed is STILL a place to stare at the ceiling until exhausted. I just can&#39;t DO that any more, so I just get up and do *something* until I&#39;m exhausted enough to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, it&#39;s just not healthy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My younger chil<br/>
d (almost 13) doesn&#39;t have that hanging over his head. (Cameron (21 toDAY!) does: unthinkingly,we imposed the same bedtime schedule on him that *I* had as a child! Ugh!) Duncan truly sleeps when tired, awakes when refreshed. He doesn&#39;t struggle with sleep at ALL. He KNOWS his body&#39;s cues. Very, very cool. NOT that he doesn&#39;t push it---sometimes he&#39;s having just too much fun to go to sleep, but he knows to alter a few things to &quot;realign&quot; himself after the excitement&#39;s over.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many schooled children have to get up as early as 6:00am, so I get why &quot;earlier to bed&quot; would be helpful---they DO need rest, and they aren&#39;t allowed to sleep in or to nap when tired. But my unschooled children can sleep as long as they need to in the morning, so they get PLENTY of rest. Plus, mine can nap at any time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tweens/teens often go through a biological switch, when their bodies refuse to sleep when it&#39;s dark. They just *can&#39;t* get to sleep until daylight. I wonder whether that&#39;s a survival thang left over from cave times: they were the night guards. &lt;g&gt; And I believe that&#39;s why schooled teens get *such* a bad rap: they are truly EXHAUSTED because school interferes with their natural sleep schedule, so they are terribly sleep-deprived. If *we* kept their schedule, we&#39;d be grumpy too!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So much better to let them discover their bodies&#39; natural rhythms! Not only will they be happier children, they&#39;ll be happier adults! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll address the other concerns in different emails.<br/>

<br/>
Video games.  I&#39;ve been reading the WoW thread with interest.  I do have to say <br/>
that my viewpoint on video games has changed just since being on this list for a <br/>
few days.  I was one of those moms that hated video games.  We have a 360, Wii, <br/>
2 DSs and 2 PSPs.  My kids were allowed to play only on the weekends and only if <br/>
they got their schoolwork and chores done during the week.  However, after <br/>
reading quite a few of these posts, I&#39;ve done a complete 180.  My son wants to <br/>
be a video game designer and it&#39;s like a lightbulb went off when I read <br/>
something about pursuing what they&#39;re passionate in and helping them develop the <br/>
skills that they want to pursue.  I was almost like &quot;Duh!&quot; if he wants to do <br/>
that for a living he needs to see how the various engines work, etc.  So now, <br/>
hubby and I are trying to decide, again, where the balance is.  On the weekends, <br/>
he literally plays from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed (unless we&#39;d <br/>
like to watch something on tv - the tv in the living room is the only one with <br/>
the game systems on it).  They also have iPods that they download various <br/>
television shows on (Mythbusters, Mystery Diagnosis).  I&#39;m guessing that he <br/>
probably plays so much on the weekends because that is the only time he gets to.  <br/>
He has actually said that he wants to get in as much time as he can on the <br/>
weekends because its (t<br/>
o him) such a short time.  So, we&#39;d like to give him more <br/>
access, but how much?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It IS A short time!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your passion?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If your husband limited *you* the way your children are limited, how would you feel? Wouldn&#39;t you *live* for the weekends? Wouldn&#39;t you plan your week so that on Saturdays you would do *only* that from sun-up to sun-down? Would you want to quit your passion to go to something with your husband? Or would you choose to ignore him (and whatever cool outing he had planned) because your time was soooo limited that you had to FILL Saturday with your passion because you wouldn&#39;t get that chance for a whole WEEK?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How much access would be enough?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What would you do if your time were ...again...ARBITRARILY limited? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are *natural* limits: I&#39;m a freakishly passionate gardener. Winter is down-time, of course, but I&#39;m still planning, reading seed catalogues, building new beds, dreaming. &lt;g&gt; But I&#39;m not actually *out* there, planting or picking. The *natural* limit is that it&#39;s too cold right now. I&#39;m also naturally limited in gardening, even in the summer, by darkness and trips out of town and playing with my children and painting the deck and.... Other things may stop me from gardening, but there&#39;s no one lording over me, saying that I&#39;ve had enough.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Duncan has NO Limits with gaming. There are days when he&#39;s playing from dawn &#39;til dusk. But just this week he got a new deck of Magic, <br/>
the Gathering cards, and didn&#39;t play a game all day. He was busy learning the rules and comparing cards and looking up info on the computer. We&#39;ve had friends in from Rhode Island this week: they&#39;ve been playing and going for walks, and listening to music. We&#39;re at the water park next week: he&#39;ll have his gaming computer with him, but he&#39;ll be running around the water park with friends all week---and probably too busy to play much.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The deal is: he can CHOOSE whether to play or not because he *can*. If I limited his playing to weekends, I could guarantee that, on weekends, that&#39;s ALL he&#39;d do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Parents are convinced that their children are addicted to gaming because they allow the children to game only on the weekends, and---surprise!---the children play non-stop on weekends---to the exclusion of all else. DUH! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If allowed free rein, they *will* choose to do other things. But if controlled, they NEED to get in every single *second* allowed them---and sneak in more when they can. So it *looks* like an &quot;addiction.&quot; But, really, the parents have just set up this situation by limiting them too harshly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve seen the benefits of letting him have more time for his passions. I&#39;ll warn you: if you decide to allow more time, he&#39;ll take every single MINUTE! It will probably look like he&#39;s &quot;addicted.&quot; Because he&#39;s been limited, he&#39;ll probably not quite trust that you&#39;re serious, so he&#39;ll be *hoarding* his gaming time, thinking you&#39;ll take it away again. But if20you&#39;re patient, he&#39;ll level back out and want to do other things too. Even on Saturdays. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh---I&#39;d also consider a second TV. It&#39;ll make life easier! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Chores.  I&#39;ve only been on here a few days so I&#39;ve not read anything about <br/>
chores.  I have some medical issues and some days I just can not do a lot.  <br/>
Right now we have a chore list but after a while of doing the same chores they <br/>
get bored.  I can understand.  They&#39;ve also come to realize that there are some <br/>
things that they just don&#39;t like doing as far as chores go.  How do you handle <br/>
chores?  A list?  Let them do what they want?  My dd - I hate to say it - but <br/>
she is quite lazy and will walk over a pile of dirty clothes rather than put it <br/>
in the hamper or, God forbid, throw it in the washing machine.  We told her a <br/>
year or so back that we would not tell her how to keep her room.  If she chose <br/>
to clean it, fine, if not, fine.  The only stipulation we put on that is she <br/>
couldn&#39;t leave food/dishes (bugs) in the room and we&#39;d like her to pick up her <br/>
laundry and put it in the laundry room because after a while it starts to smell.  <br/>
Other than that we&#39;ve got various chores from folding a load of laundry to <br/>
emptying the dishwasher, etc.  How do you handle chores?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****************************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you do a site search for &quot;chores,&quot; you&#39;ll have pages and pages to read. It&#39;s a VERY common question here. You can also look on Joyce&#39;s and Sandra&#39;s sites for even more on chores. www.sandradodd.com and www.joyfullyrejoycing.com<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The first thi<br/>
ng I&#39;d suggest is to not call your daughter &quot;lazy&quot;---here or anywhere else. She&#39;s only 11. She doesn&#39;t have the same need for neatness that you do. It&#39;ll come...when she&#39;s ready----and usually as *soon* as you quit worrying about it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have chores. If something needs to be done, someone does it. More than likely, it falls on me, my husband, or my older son. I really don&#39;t expect much in the way of housekeeping from my 12 year old. But if I ask him to do something, he usually does it. But it&#39;s a *question*---and he doesn&#39;t have to say yes. But I rarely hear &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If something bothers one of us, *that* person cleans it up. It&#39;s never someone else&#39;s responsibility. I feel we model responsibility by being responsible. *I* am responsible for my house, my children, my pets, my car, my garden. The more *I* care for those things, the more my children see how important it is to care for the things you love. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Too many people won&#39;t even clean up their own trash because they figure someone else will do it. &quot;It&#39;s not their job.&quot; The idea that children must clean up their own messes is what I believe causes that. I think we should clean up because we *care*---not because it&#39;s someone else&#39;s mess. So I lovingly clean up. A lot. &lt;g&gt; The outcome of that is that my boys *ALSO* lovingly clean up. A lot. Not because we have a chore list or because I make them, but because they want to care for our environment, they like clean clothes, they love our pets<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for who does what around here: we all have things we prefer to do and things we&#39;re not wild about. I like loading the dishwasher, but I hate to unload and put away. Cam loves to put away, but would rather wash by hand than load the washer. &lt;g&gt; We team up. &lt;g&gt; Cameron&#39;s my recycle nut: he chooses to take the trash out because he knows he&#39;ll do a better job of sorting recyclables than Ben or I will. Everyone likes to cook. Nobody does windows. &lt;BWG&gt; I pay someone now (ever other week) to scrub bathrooms, clean the kitchen, dust, vacuum, and mop. I LOVE not having to worry about that any more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve cleaned the boys&#39; rooms for years. Now I never clean Cam&#39;s room---and it&#39;s always spotless. I still clean Dunc&#39;s room for him. He LOVES when it&#39;s neat and organized. He&#39;s VERY grateful when he comes home to a clean room---it&#39;s so much more peaceful, he says. Whenever the den or kitchen is overwhelming, someone starts picking up and wiping down; others join in. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I get the health issues. But what would you do if you had no children? You&#39;d still have laundry to do, toilets to scrub, and supper to prepare. Dishes don&#39;t clean themselves. Carpets still need vacuuming. Having children doesn&#39;t man getting slave labor. &lt;G&gt; Who would be cleaning your house if you had no children? OR---what if your children were disabled in some way and couldn&#39;t do the work for you? Who would be caring for the house AND them then?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We do what needs to be done. We=2<br/>
0can choose to whine about how hard it is or about how it&#39;s always messy, but what&#39;s that modeling? I want my boys to see me lovingly and joyfully caring for them. I hope they&#39;ll do the same for their kids. They&#39;re *already* doing the same for me!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly. My all-night-owl 13-year-old started working on her sleeping  <br/>
and waking times more than a week ahead of Christmas, so she could go  <br/>
to sleep before midnight and wake up early for presents. She always  <br/>
realigns for what she wants to do or is scheduled to do (riding,  <br/>
traveling, etc.).<br/>

the night shift (unless they want to, of course &lt;g&gt;). Things change  <br/>
and it&#39;s how *we* handle it that can make the difference for our kids.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>** Hey, I have a question about this.  Do you think it&#39;s possible for<br/>
someone&#39;s body clock to change?  For instance, I have this habit of<br/>
staying up until about 2am, catching up on all my unschooling emails<br/>
etc. I can usually sleep in the next morning because my kids are older<br/>
now (6, 8, 12 & 15), although i do sometimes get caught out with<br/>
visitors when I&#39;m still in bed or just up and still in my jammies! <br/>
Now, I didn&#39;t USED to stay up until 2am.  It&#39;s a habit that&#39;s<br/>
developed over time because I enjoy the late night quiet hours for my<br/>
reading. <br/>
<br/>
The same with my children.  They&#39;ve gradually become habitually later<br/>
and later to bed, but it&#39;s been a slow change (the two I&#39;m mostly<br/>
talking about are 6 & 8), so it&#39;s something that I feel could possibly<br/>
be helped to change back.<br/>
<br/>
I also wonder how much our apparent &quot;body clocks&quot; are influenced by<br/>
the exciting technological possibilities, that can tend to<br/>
artificially stimulate our senses.  I know for me, that if I wasn&#39;t<br/>
sitting here on the computer, I&#39;d probably be in bed reading a book,<br/>
and I usually find I&#39;m more in touch with my tiredness when I do that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m asking these questions to help me get my head around the whole<br/>
sleep thing, because I want to respect my children in this, and I need<br/>
to understand it better.  I also need to be able to help my husband<br/>
understand it better, because he&#39;s much more inclined to &quot;put the<br/>
children to bed&quot; at a time that he thinks is appropriate, because<br/>
children &quot;should be in bed&quot; by a particular time.  It&#39;s not<br/>
necessarily to do with the time on the clock, but he will definitely<br/>
make comments such as &quot;It&#39;s not normal&quot; for children to be up this<br/>
late, or &quot;It&#39;s healthier to be asleep by about 10pm so you can sleep<br/>
longer in the dark hours & wake up in the sunlight hours&quot; (based on<br/>
some reading on health & wellness he&#39;s done).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; What would happen if they stayed up all night?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They&#39;d sleep later.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>*** My 6 year old daughter, in particular, doesn&#39;t seem to sleep<br/>
later, even when she has had a really late night.  Actually, she<br/>
habitually stays up pretty late & gets up before others in the family,<br/>
and often seems cranky and tired.  Any ideas of how to deal with this<br/>
issue?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; The goal is to help them figure out what sleepy feels like and help  <br/>
&gt; them fall asleep when they choose to. To do that you remove the  <br/>
&gt; obstacles and artificial reasons that are driving them to want to  <br/>
&gt; fight sleep. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*** This is what I was referring to above.  Do you think that TVs<br/>
computers, etc could be considered &quot;artificial reasons&quot; to drive our<br/>
children to want to fight sleep.  My children are free to play<br/>
computer games etc, whenever they choose, yet they still find it hard<br/>
to turn them off even if it&#39;s quite late at night.  I try telling them<br/>
that they&#39;re welcome to play in the morning, but the lure of the game<br/>
or whatever just seems too strong.  I offer stories & cuddles etc, but<br/>
it just doesn&#39;t always work.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; *One* way is to wind down the house starting at 8. Lower lights. Do  <br/>
&gt; quieter things. Get a routine in. Bath. Reading. But don&#39;t make sleep  <br/>
&gt; mandatory. The goal is to wind the house down so others can sleep if  <br/>
&gt; they want to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>*** I love this idea, and yet the problem I have is when my DH or<br/>
older kids are doing &quot;exciting thing&quot; that the younger ones want to<br/>
join in on, eg. watching a TV show or playing the Xbox or a computer<br/>
game.  I do ask them to keep the noise down so I can create an<br/>
environment more conducive to sleep, but the younger ones still KNOW<br/>
what the older ones are doing and usually want to do it with them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have any relevant experience with larger, mixed age<br/>
families sharing one living room area, where there aren&#39;t options for<br/>
the older kids to be off in a rec room somewhere, or something like<br/>
that.  When the living space with computers & TV etc are very close to<br/>
bedrooms, etc.  I&#39;d love to hear some success stories & strategies<br/>
that I can try.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think the more useful question in terms of creating an  <br/>
&gt; environment where they can explore freely without balance chaining  <br/>
&gt; them to a single answer is &quot;How can we balance family life with free  <br/>
&gt; exploration?&quot; In terms of mindful parenting and unschooling, your  <br/>
&gt; goal isn&#39;t to find their balance for them, but to make the  <br/>
&gt; environment safe for them to explore in, and help them find options  <br/>
&gt; that don&#39;t trample on the toes of others. Give them the freedom to  <br/>
&gt; find their own balance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*** Yeah, this is one of the issues I think it&#39;s important to be<br/>
mindful of. No one lives in a vacuum, hey, and it&#39;s important that we<br/>
all respect each other!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in anticipation of many words of wisdom! : )<br/>

<br/>
When I started work, over a year ago, I had to shift my sleep <br/>
schedule to accomodate that. Since I was getting up before dawn, I <br/>
found I needed an extra hour of sleep not to be groggy the next day. <br/>
Now that I&#39;m laid off I&#39;m getting to sleep until dawn again, which <br/>
means I actually need less sleep overall. Its weird.<br/>

on the &quot;tired&quot; aspect - what can you do to make things a little <br/>
easier on her when she&#39;s tired? Can you help her find calmer <br/>
activities during the day? Work more &quot;down time&quot; into her day <br/>
somehow? Tv? Baths? Some other calming activity? If nothing else, be <br/>
aware of her tiredness as something to adjust for Not something to be <br/>

be annoyed at her tiredness. Helping her find ways to rest during the <br/>
day, and ways to *allow* for her tiredness in the day&#39;s activities <br/>
sets her up to be less cranky and, ultimately have more problem <br/>
solving skills for when she *is* cranky. <br/>

fighting sleep. I&#39;ve lived in a commune, in the middle of the woods, <br/>
with no tv period and limited computer access. The adults still found <br/>

with legos. Sometimes she&#39;ll stay up late reading to her stuffed <br/>

talking more than once. Those are our passions. Sometimes passions <br/>
keep you up late at night. That&#39;s a Good Thing.  <br/>

and have fun with the family  Hooray! That&#39;s not &quot;normal&quot; in modern, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844799480">Thanks for your reply Meredith.  I still have more questions though :)<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the idea of being able to alter apparent &quot;body clocks&quot;, the<br/>
thing I&#39;ve noticed is that their preference for going to bed has got<br/>
later and later and later (probably coinciding with being &quot;allowed&quot; to<br/>
stay up later and later and later lol).  And yet at some point we<br/>
still ask them to start getting ready for bed and so basically their<br/>
freedom does eventually come to an end.  Perhaps that is why they keep<br/>
pushing the boundary???  I&#39;d love to have the courage to &quot;let them&quot;<br/>
stay up without my husband or I actually initiating bedtime, so that<br/>
they can experience total exhaustion myself.  I wonder if we did that<br/>
for a while, whether they&#39;d be more in tune with their own tiredness<br/>
and start resisting bed less, but the fear is that they&#39;ll just get<br/>
used to going to bed later and later, and the cycle will continue?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, whilst they can and do sleep in a bit sometimes (e.g. last night<br/>
they slept from about 11.30/12.00 til almost 9 this morning) it still<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re getting enough sleep by the indicators the<br/>
next day.  It also doesn&#39;t always work for them to sleep in for ages,<br/>
because we sometimes get visitors about 9am (friends who might drop in<br/>
after delivering their kids to school).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and of course there&#39;s always the issue that my husband just isn&#39;t<br/>
open to the idea of totally free bedtimes.  He works shiftwork and I<br/>
always emphasise the importance of being quiet in the house when<br/>
anyone is asleep, but when he gets home from an evening shift, he<br/>
really appreciates a quiet peaceful (kids in bed) house when he gets<br/>
home about 11pm, so he can relax.  And when he&#39;s on an early shift the<br/>
next day, he appreciates a bit of peace and quiet before turning in<br/>
himself, and he just can&#39;t stay up late if he&#39;s leaving at 6am.  For<br/>
him, that peace and quiet definitely equals kids tucked up safely in bed.<br/>
<br/>
I find it hard to know how everyone&#39;s needs can be met.<br/>
<br/>
As for the &quot;artificial&quot; stimulus of things like electronic media<br/>
keeping us awake later at night, I&#39;m aware of what you talk about, how<br/>
anything really can draw us to stay up later than our bodyclocks would<br/>
indicate is good for us - been there done that lol!!  I&#39;m a shocker at<br/>
it myself.  <br/>
<br/>
But your comment that they&#39;re perhaps wanting to stay up late to be<br/>
part of what is going on, to socialise with the family etc, is only<br/>
occasionally true.  Sometimes, for my younger two (8 & 6) they resent<br/>
being asked to go to bed when the older boys (15 & 12) are still up<br/>
doing things like xbox or computer.  They definitely resent the<br/>
seeming &quot;injustice&quot; of it, yet the older boys are very quick to tell<br/>
them (not so nicely) that &quot;younger kids need more sleep&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s not<br/>
&#39;normal&#39; for younger kids to stay up this late; ALL your friends have<br/>
been in bed for hours!!&quot;.  Any suggestions for how to provide &quot;big boy<br/>
time&quot; for the older kids (and sometimes we like to connect with them<br/>
in this way, watching a movie that isn&#39;t really appropriate for the<br/>
younger ones) but the younger two resent missing out?  I want to<br/>
respect the big boys wanting a &quot;break&quot; from the younger two, so they<br/>
can play xbox games that are much more violent, or watch scarier<br/>
movies, etc.  But I also want to respect the way that can make the<br/>
younger ones feel.  Sometimes my solution is to just focus on settling<br/>
the younger two down with long stories etc, in their room, while the<br/>
older boys do their stuff in the lounge room (sometimes with my<br/>
husband), but this doesn&#39;t always work.  Sometimes we just all stay up<br/>
watching a movie late together.  (But of course, at the end of that,<br/>
we always initiate moving the younger two towards bed.  They don&#39;t<br/>
always resist that, mind you, because there&#39;s a natural transition to<br/>
bed after a movie, I find.)  To be honest, I&#39;m delighted when it IS a<br/>
case of them all wanting to hang out together.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s<br/>
just not often that reality.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, it&#39;s become quite common for the big boys to put themselves<br/>
to bed much earlier than the younger two.  (I know, I know, it&#39;s<br/>
interesting to see that the ones with the freedom to stay up or go to<br/>
bed, often choose to go to bed quite early, wheras the younger two who<br/>
are still &#39;asked to go to bed&#39; want to stay up as late as possible.) <br/>
In those cases, when the big boys are in bed, it&#39;s literally just a<br/>
case of the younger two wanting to play the computer or something and<br/>
not stop.  They have total freedom to do that during the day, so I&#39;m<br/>
not sure why they find it so hard to stop, when it&#39;s late at night???<br/>
 Do you think it&#39;s because they&#39;re being &quot;told&quot; to go to bed and<br/>
they&#39;re just resisting that?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long.  I&#39;m really keen to work this situation out in<br/>
a way that respects everybody&#39;s needs and desires, helps us fit into a<br/>
society that sometimes includes phone calls and visits as early as<br/>
8.30 or 9am, and so that there can be less tension and stress<br/>
surrounding the issue of sleep and bedtimes.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your advice already!<br/>

Where sleep is concerned, that means the whole idea of &quot;having&quot; to go <br/>
to bed can get in the way of a good night&#39;s sleep. The younger kids <br/>
don&#39;t see any logical reason why they should &quot;have&quot; to go to bed <br/>

resist. Its a vicious cycle. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My experience, similar to many other longtime unschoolers, is that, <br/>
given the freedom to stay up as late as they want, whenever they <br/>
want, kids really do figure out what &quot;tired&quot; feels like and what to <br/>
do about it. It helps if they can have someone stay up with them to <br/>
help out - help them get snacks and drinks when they get too tired to <br/>
do that without making a mess, remind them to be quiet, help problem <br/>
solve, that sort of thing.<br/>

courteous of others&#39; sleep: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, the kids are still asleep and <br/>
I don&#39;t want to disturb them.&quot; If you start staying up late with the <br/>
kids, call your friends and let them know that 9am is too early to <br/>
visit. I know two families of homeschoolers (not even unschoolers) <br/>
that I&#39;d never dream of calling before 10am, so 9 sounds awfully <br/>
early, unless the kids are really little. <br/>

can do that any time, not just late at night, too. It really helps to <br/>
think all &#39;round the clock, not just &quot;night is for adults&quot;. Watch a <br/>
scary movie in the afternoon while the younger kids play outside. <br/>
Hang out with the older guys in the morning, while the younger are <br/>
still sleeping! Plan some nice breakfasts with foods the little ones <br/>

doesn&#39;t get left out. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>For<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; him, that peace and quiet definitely equals kids tucked up safely <br/>

<br/>
This is trickier. Its reasonable to say: you can stay up *if* you&#39;re <br/>
quiet so dad can sleep. That&#39;s something that takes practice, and you <br/>
being up with the kids to help them remember, but its doable - its <br/>
harder if the kids are feeling pressured to go to bed at <br/>
some &quot;reasonable time&quot; though ;) <br/>
<br/>
Dad wanting quiet time is the part that gets tricky. Can he get that <br/>
in the bedroom with the door shut? Can you sit with him and chat for <br/>
a few minutes, if part of what he wants is some connection with you? <br/>
Are there other times and ways he can get his needs met? Can you and <br/>
he go for a walk together when he gets home? I know its challenging <br/>
to shift gears from work to home. Its challenging for the kids, too - <br/>
dad&#39;s home, why can&#39;t we play with him? We&#39;ve waited All Day! Maybe <br/>
you can act as a buffer between kids and dad for a little while when <br/>
he gets in, so he has time to unwind. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I find it hard to know how everyone&#39;s needs can be met.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Everyone&#39;s needs can be met if some expectations can be let go. <br/>
That&#39;s the hard part. The expectations are standing in the way of <br/>
problem solving and reducing the matter to &quot;when do they go to bed.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
One option - something to suggest, maybe, as an experiment - is to <br/>
somehow pick a &quot;bed time&quot; and then also work out a schedule for <br/>
extending it. So, for example, maybe you&#39;d start with 11:30 and every <br/>
week add another half hour - or hour, if you like. Maybe it would be <br/>
a &quot;solid&quot; bedtime, or maybe just a guide for when mom and dad get to <br/>
start turning the lights down - that&#39;s something to think about, too. <br/>
Either way, you&#39;d just about guarantee they&#39;d stay up good and late <br/>
every night for awhile - but on the other hand, you&#39;d Know it and <br/>
could plan around it. Work it into dad&#39;s shift schedule in some more <br/>
convenient way. Warn off the morning visitors in advance so you can <br/>
sleep late, too. <br/>
<br/>
The catch to all of this is that you need to be simultaneously <br/>
looking for other ways/times to connect with the older kids and for <br/>
dad to have down time. I&#39;d talk about it with everyone in the family <br/>
individulally First, get input, get ideas - for all the issues <br/>
involved. Don&#39;t expect it to all come together overnight (as it <br/>
were). Maybe come up with a variety of plans to try - do some <br/>
experimenting. Its really Okay to experiment! It can be pretty <br/>
validating to kids, actually, to have parents say &quot;I&#39;m not sure if <br/>
this is a good idea, but can we try it as an experiment?&quot; It can help <br/>
build a sense of partnership by breaking down the idea that adults <br/>
are always supposed to know what to do.<br/>
