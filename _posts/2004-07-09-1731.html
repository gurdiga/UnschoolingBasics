<div id="ygrps-yiv-74757227">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a newbie to this list but not to the idea of unschooling. I&#39;ve thought<br/>
of myself as an unschooler since my daughter was about 4. The kids are now<br/>
ages 8 and 4. My daughter went to preschool until she was 4 and then no<br/>
longer wanted to attend cause she didn&#39;t like her new teacher. My son tried<br/>
preschool this past fall. He was so eager to try and after two weeks<br/>
adamantly wanted out and has sworn off school since. I thought that going to<br/>
school might help him make more friends in our town--he thought it would be<br/>
like Barney :-/ Boy, were we both wrong!<br/>
<br/>
The idea of deschooling has so many layers I think. On Sandra Dodd&#39;s<br/>
website, she recommends some movies to watch while deschooling. Its hard for<br/>
me to not think of this as an assignment, an ingredient in learning<br/>
necessary for me to really deschool. Does anyone kwim? Or reading Holt. If I<br/>
only read enough, I will &quot;get it&quot;. If I only read enough emails on this<br/>
list, I will &quot;get it&quot;. Its schooling that encourages this sort of thinking<br/>
of knowledge coming from authorities from without--its hard to just think<br/>
about ideas as simply ideas--to be mulled over, shelved or acted on.<br/>
<br/>
We went out to eat at to a hibachi steakhouse for my daughter&#39;s birthday .<br/>
We were sitting with some strangers (if you&#39;ve never been to such a place,<br/>
everyone sits around the grill and watches the chef throw utensils, stir fry<br/>
food, make an onion volcano, and make fire. The people we were sitting with<br/>
were from our town. Of course, the conversation turned immediately to<br/>
school. These people were chatty question askers. Does anyone else not want<br/>
to talk about unschooling with schooling people? We managed to not share<br/>
that we were homeschooling by saying we lived by such and such school. I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to talk about homeschooling with them. I didn&#39;t want to defend<br/>
what we are doing or try to explain it. I wanted to watch the fire making<br/>
chef and have fun with the kids. I like when summer comes cause no well<br/>
meaning stranger is asking me why my kids aren&#39;t in school during the<br/>
day......<br/>
<br/>
I live right next to an elementary school, the &quot;best&quot; in my town according<br/>
to local parents. From my back porch a stone&#39;s throw would break a few car<br/>
windows in the parking lot, and from the end of my yard, I could do some<br/>
damage to the large plate glass windows of the library. That&#39;s how close I<br/>
am. (Many moons ago, we thought that having the school so close would be<br/>
great for our theoretical kids) The sounds of the bus, bell ringing and<br/>
announcements over the loud speaker are all a part of our day. So its<br/>
difficult to forget about school.<br/>
<br/>
I want to get a t-shirt that says something like &quot;growing without schooling&quot;<br/>
(don&#39;t ask me--www.unschooling.com--for more info) :-)<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

 <br/>
And yet here you are reading some more! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
If we all just &quot;got it&quot; by mulling it over, we wouldn&#39;t need lists or  books <br/>
or movies.<br/>
 <br/>
Different things work for different people.<br/>
 <br/>
The movies Sandra lists are &quot;unschooly&quot; movies---like _Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day  <br/>
Off_ where lots happens OUTside school. It&#39;s not an assignment unless you view <br/>
 it as such. It could be be seen as a great way to spend a week----watching  <br/>
movies in your pj&#39;s!<br/>
 <br/>
John Holt&#39;s writings (especially in order) are eye-opening. He was writing  <br/>
all this when I was in high school. *My* high school  teachers certainly never <br/>
read him!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Its schooling that encourages this sort of thinking<br/>

about  ideas as simply ideas--to be mulled over, shelved or acted on&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Most of us have come from a schooled background, so assignments are a quick  <br/>
way to get to the goal! &lt;g&gt; Kind of ironic----but whatever works!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
We &quot;old farts&quot; here don&#39;t consider ourselves &quot;authorities&quot;. We&#39;re  still on <br/>
our own journeys. We&#39;re just further along, maybe, and are so happy  with what <br/>
we&#39;ve found that we&#39;re willing to help others get to unschooling as  quickly <br/>
as possible. No one has to follow our lead, but we&#39;re happy to prod you  on if <br/>
you feel you need it.<br/>
 <br/>
If you think you&#39;ve &quot;got it&quot; already, then you don&#39;t need us. Others do, so  <br/>
we&#39;ll stay and help. When we&#39;re no longer needed, we&#39;ll just fade into  <br/>
unschooling bliss. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289573557">I&#39;m not Anastasia and I&#39;ve never done any deschooling.<br/>
My kids are young and have never been to school. <br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a whole world between watch TV/ play<br/>
video games and &quot;put learning ideas into their heads&quot;<br/>
as you put it. I think that unschooling means that you<br/>
lead full, rich, interesting lives and learning<br/>
happens. So if you want your kids to watch less TV,<br/>
think of what fun things you could do together.<br/>
What would you do if you had guests visiting from out<br/>
of town? Would you go to museums, picnics, movies?<br/>
What do you do on vacations? Try not to think in terms<br/>
of learning. Think instead in terms of what you and<br/>
the kids would enjoy doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-12024545">Hi Lesa,<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest substituting the word &quot;fun&quot; for &quot;learning&quot;.  Your kids ARE learning everyday, all the time.  They are problem-solving, figuring out social ammenities, making plans, figuring out how to carry those out.  They are learning about right and wrong, thinking about what God/Goddess might looks like (if they are inclined that way).  A few lessons that you DON&#39;T want them to learn is that learning is boring, somebody else is in control of it and that it only happens at certain times, doing certain things.<br/>
<br/>
So have fun.  Suggest cool things to do.  Go for a hike, make baklava, read African legends, watch lots of tv in your pajamas while eating ice cream.  Talk about things you/they notice...like the bird you saw looked like a wren but with different coloring, that saying &quot;baklava&quot; sounds like you are coughing, etc..  Think of the things you/they notice as little dots of illumination into the world.  Keep having fun, keep laughing and eventually those little dots start to make connections to each other.  It doesn&#39;t happen so much in a few months but in the course of years as your children grow and start to see the world at different levels of understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, enjoy, drink eggnogg.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074661051">I was just where you are about three weeks ago, so I&#39;m probably not the best person to ask about how to unschool.  We&#39;re still deschooling, and I&#39;m thinking unschooling won&#39;t be much different in our home.  I was just this morning telling a newbie school-at-home mom heading for burnout what we do, so I&#39;ll post what I told her, because it shows how we&#39;re starting to let go.  Maybe it&#39;ll help, maybe not.  We do a lot of day-to-day things, like errands and such.  We&#39;re down to one car that dh uses to get to work right now, so we don&#39;t go to museums or parks (it&#39;s too cold to walk anywhere here!) or much other &quot;interesting&quot; stuff.  It&#39;s ok for us, because there&#39;s plenty of time for that.  I stick to the practical due to necessity.  But the kids have learned about reduce/reuse/recycle when it comes to Christmas presents this year!  They&#39;ve amazed me with what they&#39;ve come up with for gifts.  They come up with the idea and carry it through to the end all on their own, without any money<br/>
 at all.  But here&#39;s what I had to say to the other mom about our deschooling experience so far.<br/>
   <br/>
  We&#39;re deschooling right now and loving it!  It&#39;s so much less taxing on everyone than when we started out in Sept. as gung-ho homeschoolers.  I got burnt out within a month and wondered what I was doing wrong.  The kids rebelled even though I gave them choices.  Then I just sat back and let the kids lead, and there&#39;s so much of a difference in their behavior and attitude and creativity that I am astounded.  For example - They played CSI last week (must be my CSI/Law & Order habit is rubbing off on them,) and they interviewed me last week CSI-style and collected evidence (including my hair) and viewed it under a microscope and found a murder weapon and figured out my motive.  It was just too cool!  They were typing away on the play laptop entering notes and looking up pretend info on the case.  They took my fingerprints, though I only let them have one because I didn&#39;t want inky fingers all day.  They have never done anything like this play before, and I wouldn&#39;t have considered it<br/>
 learning before now, either.  It took me a lot of courage to start unschooling, and the worst part is explaining it to others (which I avoid-ignorance is bliss.)  But if you find you&#39;re fighting or burnt out, it&#39;s worth a try.  The kids still learn, but it&#39;s on their terms and their timing and their way.  Trust is the key.<br/>

with an eclectic curriculum and it started breaking down very early on.  I&#39;m<br/>
just not built to nag all day long to get her to finish her work.  So I<br/>
quickly ended up here  :)<br/>
<br/>
I had heard about unschooling but never really knew exactly what it was.  I<br/>
m reading The Unschooling Handbook right now and my library has copies of<br/>
some of the other books mentioned recently. <br/>
<br/>
Luckily, I live in IL.  So I&#39;m not required to submit records.  Does anyone<br/>
recommend keeping some sort of records anyway?  And how you go about keeping<br/>
records.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it&#39;s early and I just got home from work.  Need to get to bed so I can<br/>
be up around noon.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad this group is so patient and helpful.  :)<br/>

Hi Lesa,<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest substituting the word &quot;fun&quot; for &quot;learning&quot;.  Your kids ARE<br/>
learning everyday, all the time.  They are problem-solving, figuring out<br/>
social ammenities, making plans, figuring out how to carry those out.  They<br/>
are learning about right and wrong, thinking about what God/Goddess might<br/>
looks like (if they are inclined that way).  A few lessons that you DON&#39;T<br/>
want them to learn is that learning is boring, somebody else is in control<br/>
of it and that it only happens at certain times, doing certain things.<br/>
<br/>
So have fun.  Suggest cool things to do.  Go for a hike, make baklava, read<br/>
African legends, watch lots of tv in your pajamas while eating ice cream. <br/>
Talk about things you/they notice...like the bird you saw looked like a wren<br/>
but with different coloring, that saying &quot;baklava&quot; sounds like you are<br/>
coughing, etc..  Think of the things you/they notice as little dots of<br/>
illumination into the world.  Keep having fun, keep laughing and eventually<br/>
those little dots start to make connections to each other.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
happen so much in a few months but in the course of years as your children<br/>
grow and start to see the world at different levels of understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, enjoy, drink eggnogg.<br/>

I&#39;m in Illinois as well.  You are right about not submitting records, but<br/>
Illinois law does state that you are required to keep them.  I think the<br/>
minimum you need to keep is a calendar with some sort of notation showing<br/>
when you *Did* homeschooling.  A dated journal stating what you did might be<br/>
nice to keep for your personal records.<br/>

I don&#39;t do anything for the smaller kids.  My oldest is 15 and looking at colleges.  She is keeping track of things in case she needs a portfolio or whatever.  Luckily, she is big into 4-H and doing her record book (kind of a scrap book for the year)keep track of stuff for her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-320825133">&quot;Luckily, I live in IL.  So I&#39;m not required to submit records.  <br/>
Does anyone<br/>
recommend keeping some sort of records anyway?  And how you go about <br/>
keeping<br/>
records.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nah, don&#39;t keep &quot;records&quot;...how about keep memories instead?:)<br/>
I think one of the best things we&#39;ve done, is take lots of photos, <br/>
write journal entries etc...about our LIVES.<br/>
I was amazed this week, as we read some old journals, about all the <br/>
cute things the kids had done that I&#39;d forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
Write down the funny things they say, write down the &quot;aha&quot; moments, <br/>
the connections between family members, the tough days...write it <br/>
all down, even briefly and you&#39;ll be amazed at the lovely stories <br/>
you collect.<br/>
The kids love looking through our old photo albums. Sometimes we get <br/>
inspired all over again! They were looking at the butterfly release <br/>
they&#39;d done and asked if we could raise more butterflies. I <br/>
mentioned incubating eggs again and Jared said &quot;It was such a PAIN <br/>
though!&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
So keeping track of your bubbly, interesting life is well worth the <br/>
time, and will usually suffice if any official needs some kind <br/>
of &quot;proof&quot; (which I doubt  you&#39;ll ever have to deal with).<br/>

I&#39;m in Illinois as well.  You are right about not submitting records, but<br/>
Illinois law does state that you are required to keep them.  I think the<br/>
minimum you need to keep is a calendar with some sort of notation showing<br/>
when you *Did* homeschooling.  A dated journal stating what you did might be<br/>
nice to keep for your personal records.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424271949">I looked as well (I try to keep track of what&#39;s up in different <br/>
states) and from what I can see (I&#39;m not in IL), if you are <br/>
contacted about a truancy situation, you can send a notice of <br/>
assurance that you are in compliance (that is you are homeschooling -<br/>
 not just keeping your kids out of school where they are enrolled). <br/>
It would be possible, if it came down to court, that you might need <br/>
to have evidence of covering the requisite subjects. But there is no <br/>
requirement I could see of attendance records, test records, <br/>
portfolio records, etc. being kept at all, much less submitted. The <br/>
law even indicates that the number of days doesn&#39;t apply to <br/>
homeschoolers because they are private schools and private schools <br/>
can set their own attendance requirements.<br/>
<br/>
This might better be addressed in an IL specific list too where <br/>
there are more folks in IL, instead of in this global group where <br/>
you&#39;ll get a smaller sampling of folks who&#39;ve BTDT in IL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-163833049">I don&#39;t know about Illinois, but in Indiana we have to keep attendance records, we just don&#39;t have to submit them unless the Superintendent of Schools asks to see them, so I&#39;ve been using a homeschool recordkeeping program called Homeschool Tracker.  The basic version is available to download free at www.tghomesoft.com .  It includes a lot of stuff an unschooler doesn&#39;t need, but the Daily Journal feature is nice (I tend to use it weekly unless we have a really special day).  If you need to keep attendance, or a log, or even just a list of &quot;subjects&quot; and materials used, it gives you a nice, professional-looking printout to show anyone you might need to (and you can&#39;t beat the price).<br/>

&gt; My daughter is 9 now and it&#39;s our first year homeschooling... we started<br/>

&gt; just not built to nag all day long to get her to finish her work.  So I<br/>
&gt; quickly ended up here  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had heard about unschooling but never really knew exactly what it<br/>
&gt; was.  I<br/>
&gt; m reading The Unschooling Handbook right now and my library has copies of<br/>

&gt; Hi Lesa,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would suggest substituting the word &quot;fun&quot; for &quot;learning&quot;.  Your kids ARE<br/>
&gt; learning everyday, all the time.  They are problem-solving, figuring out<br/>
&gt; social ammenities, making plans, figuring out how to carry those<br/>
&gt; out.  They<br/>
&gt; are learning about right and wrong, thinking about what God/Goddess might<br/>
&gt; looks like (if they are inclined that way).  A few lessons that you DON&#39;T<br/>
&gt; want them to learn is that learning is boring, somebody else is in control<br/>
&gt; of it and that it only happens at certain times, doing certain things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So have fun.  Suggest cool things to do.  Go for a hike, make baklava,<br/>
&gt; read<br/>
&gt; African legends, watch lots of tv in your pajamas while eating ice cream.<br/>
&gt; Talk about things you/they notice...like the bird you saw looked like a<br/>
&gt; wren<br/>
&gt; but with different coloring, that saying &quot;baklava&quot; sounds like you are<br/>
&gt; coughing, etc..  Think of the things you/they notice as little dots of<br/>
&gt; illumination into the world.  Keep having fun, keep laughing and<br/>
&gt; eventually<br/>
&gt; those little dots start to make connections to each other.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; happen so much in a few months but in the course of years as your children<br/>
&gt; grow and start to see the world at different levels of understanding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Relax, enjoy, drink eggnogg.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; How is the deschooling going?  I feel like we should be doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; something...do the kids eventually stop wanting to watch TV and<br/>
&gt; &gt; play video games all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; time?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; At what point do you help put learning ideas into their heads or<br/>
&gt; &gt; does that<br/>
&gt; &gt; even matter?  I&#39;m very new at homeschooling and very very new at<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling  It was tough enough to explain homeschooling to<br/>
&gt; &gt; family and friends, I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; t wait to figure out how to explain unschooling.  I may just keep<br/>

&gt; &gt; now,first year home together, having fun and witnessing changes in<br/>
&gt; &gt; our lives and<br/>
&gt; &gt; relationships.  I just got done reading John Holt&#39;s, &quot;Teach Your<br/>

&gt; &gt; was as good as the other two of his books you mentioned, and got<br/>
&gt; &gt; down to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; business of unschooling as a concrete day-to-day thing, not just a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bunch of<br/>
&gt; &gt; ideas.  How was the Thomas Armstrong book?  I don&#39;t think I have<br/>

their Birth certificates and their social security cards. And, <br/>
medical records UNLESS you choose not to (there is info in that <br/>
section on opting out/waiving/whatever they call it). Nothing <br/>
whatsoever mentioned about &#39;educational&#39; records (unless you <br/>
withdrew your kids and have their school records as well, then stash <br/>
those someplace safe as well). Although, if you are taken to court, <br/>
you might need evidence of providing the requisite subject areas in <br/>

didn&#39;t panic over record keeping. Most folks keep a copy of their <br/>
child&#39;s birth certificate and SS card (along with car titles, house <br/>
deeds/mortgage papers, marriage certificates if any, divorce decrees <br/>
if any, dog license, etc) so saying you &quot;have to keep these records <br/>
to homeschool&quot; is really kind of moot as far as I&#39;m concerned. Yeah, <br/>
some folks don&#39;t have SS cards or birth certificates but the odds <br/>
are pretty long that anyone will notice until they try to get a job.<br/>

are we there yet? are we there yet?&quot; and missing all of what is <br/>
going by right now. A journey is not the end. Or, as a wise guy said <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-890041681">Watch the videos and programs with them. Discuss the programs.  Make some popcorn or brownies or whatever to eat during the programs.  Set out some fun toys for them to mess around with while they watch.  Also lots of comfy blankets, pillows etc...   Don&#39;t plan trips unless you first check to see if they want to go.  I wouldn&#39;t want to go to a movie premier party with people I barely know either.  With rare exception, I would almost always rather wait for the dvd to come out.<br/>
  I would be checking into a memebership to blockbuster or netflix or something and would be ordering movies, lots of them, all kinds, some of my favorites that I liked as a kid, old classics, new releases.  Embrace their interest, maybe see about a digital video camera.  Maybe they would like to make a movie themselves?????   Sometimes after my kids have seen the movie, they enjoy hearing the book, sometimes not.  Some movies/tv series have games to go along with them.  There is nothing to wait for, life is what is happening right now.<br/>

<br/>
Can you sit down with them and fold laundry or crochet or something while<br/>
they watch?  Then you&#39;re there, interacting with them, hearing about what<br/>
they think the good bits are but you have something to do too.  <br/>
<br/>
***I know there are other things out there they would enjoy if they just<br/>
tried.  I KNOW it.<br/>
They are just timid.***<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re young.  There&#39;s lots of time for them to discover the world.  If<br/>
this is what they really like right now it&#39;s ok. <br/>
It&#39;s really very cool that you have a house they like to be in.  Some<br/>
kids can&#39;t wait to get out.  <br/>
Keep offering things you think they would enjoy but don&#39;t attach yourself<br/>
to their response.  Let it be ok to accept or decline.   <br/>
<br/>
***It is wonderful that your family is so active.  That is my whole<br/>
point.<br/>
Ours is not.  How can I relax?***<br/>
<br/>
Some people are naturally more adventurous than others.  Are there other<br/>
people in your family who are content to stay home?  Maybe your kids have<br/>
a genetic component of homebodieness. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But what your kids are doing today is not &quot;who&quot; they are.  They are<br/>
complex people who will grow and change.  Some interests last forever but<br/>
people seldom have only one interest their whole lives long.  You&#39;re kids<br/>
will try new things when they&#39;re ready. <br/>
<br/>
***If I was any more relaxed I would be<br/>
dead.***<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t hear from you in awhile we&#39;ll send someone over to check your<br/>
pulse. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll be ok.  Really.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-588192598">I&#39;m fairly new at this but this is one area I had a hard time with to begin <br/>
with.  My boys love racing games... cars, motorcycles, trucks you name it - <br/>
they race it.  I can&#39;t keep that dang vehicle on the track for nothing !! <br/>
But I did try. The boys found a game where the purpose was TO crash !!  Yee <br/>
ha, my kind of game.  I&#39;m not always interested in every game they play but <br/>
when they want me to watch for a minute, I do.  I also put alot of the other <br/>
activities we do during the day in the same room. That way while they are <br/>
gaming, I can be on the laptop, knitting, making jewelry or whatever but I <br/>
can still be close to them.<br/>
<br/>
Fake it? I know my kids know in a minute if someone is being &quot;fake&quot; about <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
I too would love it if they were ready to expand onto other things, and <br/>
someday maybe they will.  And then again maybe they won&#39;t, they might grow <br/>
up to be video game testers or computer programmers.  Who knows?<br/>
<br/>
Our family isn&#39;t an overly active family. We live way out in the country so <br/>
it takes a bit to get somewhere else.  So we just try and make sure everyone <br/>
has something they like to do around here.<br/>
<br/>
Relax? Well I&#39;m still working on that :)   I read this list everyday & a few <br/>
others. Just knowing there are people out here who understand what we are <br/>
going thru is a big help.  There are some people here who I want to grow up <br/>
to be just like  ;)<br/>

And that&#39;s my two cents for tonight ~~~~~~~~~<br/>

 My boys love racing games... cars, motorcycles, trucks you name it - <br/>
&gt; they race it.  I can&#39;t keep that dang vehicle on the track for <br/>
nothing !! <br/>
&gt; But I did try. The boys found a game where the purpose was TO <br/>
crash !!  Yee <br/>
&gt; ha, my kind of game.  I&#39;m not always interested in every game they <br/>
play but <br/>
&gt; when they want me to watch for a minute, I do.  I also put alot of <br/>
the other <br/>
&gt; activities we do during the day in the same room. That way while <br/>
they are <br/>
&gt; gaming, I can be on the laptop, knitting, making jewelry or whatever <br/>
but I <br/>
&gt; can still be close to them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit, I LOVE video games where the point is to crash the <br/>
car.  :)  We have one where the car actually bursts into flames then <br/>
burns up if you run it into buildings or other vehicles enough times.  <br/>
I find it very satisfying.  lol. <br/>
<br/>
We actually haven&#39;t played any video games in a while.  The kids seem <br/>
to go in spells.  A solid week of video games from dawn to dusk, then <br/>
a week of legos, then a week of paper mache and paint.  Hammers, <br/>
nails, hot glue... *things*. <br/>
<br/>
My son will build something big enough to live in out of cardboard <br/>
while my daughter is sewing curtains, modifying her clothes, or <br/>
rehairing My Little Ponies for example. There are odd smaller things <br/>
thrown in, and we always make park days, but there is usually <br/>
something where the primary focus is for days on end.  We have a lot <br/>
of overlap where we enter and exit each others&#39; projects, and do a lot <br/>
of things together... and do spend time in the same room doing <br/>
different things.<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried blasting music and jumping up and down together?  <br/>
That&#39;s a fun family activity.  Leads to lots of giggles and silliness <br/>
together. lol.  You can&#39;t help but be in a good mood after that!  (In <br/>
fact, it&#39;s gotten to the point here that if I&#39;m getting a little <br/>
grumpy, one of the kids will put on a &quot;jumping around&quot; song knowing it <br/>
will work some magic and make our day go better.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Develop an interest. If that means fake it a bit then, yes, I think  <br/>
you should.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes you are. Your focus is on expanding their experiences by doing  <br/>
&quot;other&quot; things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am trying to expand their world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right. But you&#39;re doing it by trying to entice them to do OTHER  <br/>
things. I&#39;m saying do it by starting with what they are into right  <br/>
now. Start with that and you&#39;ll find that their interests will  <br/>
naturally expand.<br/>

reality that they don&#39;t want to do these other things you&#39;re offering.<br/>
