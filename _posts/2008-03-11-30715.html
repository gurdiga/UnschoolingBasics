<div id="ygrps-yiv-491413239">We started unschooling in December and since then I&#39;ve been trying to  <br/>
be more peaceful/calm with my kids. I bought Connection Parenting and  <br/>
loaded it on my dh&#39;s ipod. I don&#39;t even think he listened to the whole  <br/>
thing. Anyway, last night Romeo (age 9) was in his room crying. So I  <br/>
went in to see what was wrong. He was upset because his lego house had  <br/>
came apart. Dh heard him and came in Romeo&#39;s room too. Dh wanted to  <br/>
know what was wrong. So Romeo explained that he was upset that his  <br/>
lego house had came apart and that now he&#39;d have to put it back  <br/>
together again. Dh said something like oh it&#39;ll be ok and don&#39;t cry  <br/>
about it! So then Dh left the room and he heard Romeo crying again  <br/>
about it. So he went back in Romeo&#39;s room and this time yelled at him  <br/>
and said, &quot; Why are you crying? and he repeated it like 4 times. Romeo  <br/>
was just sobbing then and so he grabbed him by the ear and yanked him  <br/>
off the bed. Then said,&quot; I said stop crying! Pick up all your legos  <br/>
now&quot;.  I was in the living room with the little ones but he was loud  <br/>
enough and so I could hear the whole convo. So I went in and Romeo was  <br/>
crying hard this time and his ear was bright red. And so I asked Dh  <br/>
what was wrong. I then tried to help Romeo pick up his legos so Dh  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be mad anymore. Then when we were done picking up legos I  <br/>
followed Dh into the living room. I said,&quot; What&#39;s the big deal?&quot; I  <br/>
mean if he wants to cry in his room why don&#39;t you let him?&quot; He&#39;s not  <br/>
bothering anyone. &quot; He&#39;s upset about his legos.&quot;  And dh says &quot; he is  <br/>
crying and he is bothering someone&quot;. Then Romeo who followed us into  <br/>
the living room says something. I can&#39;t remember but then Dh says stop  <br/>
yelling at me and repeated that like 3 times. I didn&#39;t think he was  <br/>
yelling he just talks a little bit louder than most people. It really  <br/>
bugs dh though.  Then Romeo raised his hand or touched his head or  <br/>
something and Dh says don&#39;t  think you&#39;re going to hit me cause it  <br/>
will never happen! I mean he overreacts and is so hard on Romeo. Then  <br/>
Dh goes to our room and we don&#39;t talk to each other. I know he was mad  <br/>
because I said something to him and especially in front of the kids.   <br/>
He doesn&#39;t like me telling him not to do this or that with Romeo and I  <br/>
don&#39;t know what else to do or how to handle this. I thought by putting  <br/>
that Connection Parenting on his ipod that he&#39;d understand. But he  <br/>
just doesn&#39;t agree with kids being our equals.  Please help me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-528620187">I  think alot of husbands don&#39;t like to be given homework <br/>
assginments, and that may be why he didn&#39;t listen to it.  <br/>
<br/>
I also think it is a good idea to let everyone cool off and wait for <br/>
the right moment to talk about differences in parenting styles, esp <br/>
when you are going to tell someone you don&#39;t agree with what they are <br/>
doing.  He is probably feeling defensive, and he is reaction was <br/>
based on the way he was treated when he was a child.<br/>
<br/>
By DH and I have some big parenting differences.  Occasionally he <br/>
over reacts and I pick up the pieces. <br/>
<br/>
The most effective thing I have found to change my DH mind, is to <br/>
practice peaceful parenting.  When he sees things working for me, he <br/>
tries them.  When I see him doing something that works, I comment on <br/>
how well it worked.  For instance, Logan (4) has had a terrible time <br/>
adjusting to the Sunday School class I teach.  DH is helping me with <br/>
the class.  DH has tried getting angry, time-outs, etc to get Logan <br/>
to join in the class.  Still, Sunday after Sunday, Logan refused to <br/>
participate for the most part. Then one Sunday, DH spent a little <br/>
time play wrestling Logan, when he started his normal refusal.  Next <br/>
thing you know Logan was happily participating in class.  I commented <br/>
how amazing that Logan participated after DH got done play <br/>
wrestling.  Since then, DH uses that tactic and Sunday School is <br/>
smoother for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
So it is kinda like I unschool my DH, giving him room to find what <br/>
works for him.  I&#39;m the primary caregiver, so I think the occasional <br/>
overreaction my DH isn&#39;t going to be harmful long term.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301186828">I hate answering these, but no one else has bitten. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was in your same spot. And looking back, I would handle it <br/>
differently than I did---which was to stop Ben&#39;s arm mid-whack and <br/>
say---YELL---that if he did that again it would be the *last* time <br/>
&#39;cause I&#39;d take the kids and move somewhere he&#39;d never find us and he&#39;d <br/>
never get to even *touch* the boys again.<br/>
<br/>
It took us all a while to heal. But I didn&#39;t let him alone with the <br/>
boys and always intervened before things escalated. Eventually he got <br/>
it. Now he&#39;s damned good at it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I&#39;d recommend. Tell him that you feel it&#39;s your job to <br/>
protect each and every member of your family and that he may NOT hurt <br/>
anyone you love on purpose again. That you wouldn&#39;t let anyone hurt <br/>
*him* either and that home needs to be SAFE for *everyone*.<br/>
<br/>
What he&#39;s doing us probably EXACTLY what was done to him---probably <br/>
word-for-word and blow-for-blow. He truly knows no better. Keep in mind <br/>
that he was a hurt and sensitive little boy---just like Romeo. If you <br/>
can get him alone and ask how he felt when his father did that to him, <br/>
maybe he&#39;ll open up and remember how small and powerless he felt. He <br/>
needs to remember how it felt when he was scared of someone he loves. <br/>
That may take some time though.<br/>
<br/>
But while the two of you work through that, I would NOT let him go <br/>
check on things without me *right there* to intervene. EVER!<br/>
<br/>
Romeo needs to know he can count on you to protect him more than your <br/>
husband needs to be all-powerful. And both need to know that you will <br/>
be that protector. If not *you*, WHO?<br/>
<br/>
Oh---how&#39;s your husband&#39;s relationship with *his* father? Is that what <br/>
he wants for him and Romeo?<br/>

Thank you for taking up the answering. You expressed what I felt when I read the original post. On the one hand that is how I have done it, too. Namely protecting the little one.But there is more to it in the setup of the family as you said, too. Healing the hurt little boy in the big man. <br/>
OK, I have a similar situation at present with the grandchildren. Ariëlla, 14 months, is getting massive NO&#39;s at present. And all of them are just handed down from previous lives. This has to stop here and now!  Charlotte and the girls are coming again on Sunday for the week and I&#39;ll have &#39;the talk&#39; with my husband before that. Thank you Kelly for reminding me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-124940691">I started this yesterday before the other replies. It repeats quite a  <br/>
bit of what was already said but I&#39;ll send it anyway :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how can I get dh on board with peaceful parenting?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think, first off, by not trying to change him.<br/>
<br/>
What if he wanted you to be more authoritarian? Would reprimanding  <br/>
you in front of the kids help you feel like adopting his ways? Would  <br/>
loading a book about it on your iPod help? Would jumping in when you  <br/>
were parenting how you thought best help?<br/>
<br/>
How could he get you to change to his way?<br/>
<br/>
I think talking about what you&#39;d like to accomplish with the kids  <br/>
while not in the midst of a crisis will help. That you want to be  <br/>
someone your kids trust to come to with a problem not someone they&#39;re  <br/>
afraid of. Make it *your* deal not something you want to impose on  <br/>
him. But as others suggested home should be a place where *everyone*  <br/>
feels safe and if anyone&#39;s pulling anyone else&#39;s ears it needs to stop.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So he went back in Romeo&#39;s room and this time yelled at him<br/>
&gt; and said, &quot; Why are you crying? and he repeated it like 4 times.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s quite possible that this is the way his parents reacted to him.  <br/>
When he hears Romeo crying he feels a huge shame building up in him  <br/>
at how wrong it is -- the shame that his parents instilled in him for  <br/>
crying -- and he needs to stop it.<br/>
<br/>
You might suggest during your talk away from the crisis that if he&#39;s  <br/>
trying to figure out what to about Romeo that, as was suggested on  <br/>
another list, he be the parent he wished he&#39;d had. Do what he wished  <br/>
his parents would have done for him rather than what they did do.<br/>
<br/>
It may come up that he needs Romeo quiet or to behave or whatever.  <br/>
But Romeo needs to feel safe to be sad or angry. Talk about what he  <br/>
can do instead of trying to make Romeo be quiet. He&#39;s a hurt boy too  <br/>
and he needs some help too.<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s REALLY, REALLY helpful!<br/>
<br/>
So he never really had a strong mom who was *his* protector and <br/>
nurturer. AND he doesn&#39;t have a gentle dad-role model.<br/>
<br/>
Ok---put yourself there. You&#39;re five. Your real mom&#39;s dead. Your <br/>
step-mom has four older kids or four tiny ones (can&#39;t tell by the <br/>
description)---either way, doesn&#39;t have time for *you*. You&#39;re raised <br/>
by older siblings (children who probably don&#39;t have a lot of skills in <br/>
handling smaller children---probably weren&#39;t a lot modeled for *them* <br/>
either!). ANd your father&#39;s MO was to use the belt and yell.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t that SUCK??!!<br/>
<br/>
Find a quiet time and talk a LOT about this. Find out what he would <br/>
have liked to have had done when he was little. Suggest that maybe <br/>
Romeo could have a better relationship with him as a father IF he <br/>
wanted to. The only person that can change him is His-Own-Self---but <br/>
that YOU are there to help him.<br/>
<br/>
If he does want to change, maybe come up with a secret &quot;cue&quot; word that <br/>
either of you can use with the other: something you can say to him if <br/>
you think he&#39;s getting out of control and something he can say to you <br/>
when he&#39;s feeling about to burst.<br/>
<br/>
***IMPORTANT*** When either of you uses the word, the the behavior MUST <br/>
STOP NOW!<br/>
<br/>
If you say it, he needs to back off and let you handle it.<br/>
<br/>
If he says it, you must be willing to stop whatever you are doing to <br/>
help him out.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important for him to know that you aren&#39;t saying he&#39;s a bad dad. <br/>
It&#39;s just that you know he needs help in this &quot;low skills&quot; area of his <br/>
and that you won&#39;t criticize him for his bad decisions. He needs to put <br/>
more tools in his tool box. Right now, all he has is 1) yelling and 2) <br/>
ear-pinching (Does he need his own ear pinched to remember how that <br/>
feels?) He may feel that he&#39;s doing better than his own dad because <br/>
he&#39;s NOT using the belt. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s *good* to ear pinch? <br/>
No, but for *him* it might be a step in the right direction. He just <br/>
needs a LOT more tools.<br/>
<br/>
He needs to feel supported---AND *NOT* out of control.<br/>
<br/>
YOU need to know that your children are as safe and and happy as you <br/>
wish he had been when he was little. Tell him if *YOU* had been his <br/>
mom, you wold NEVER have allowed him to be treated like that.<br/>
<br/>
But you aren&#39;t his mom, you&#39;re *Romeo&#39;s* mom.<br/>
<br/>
Commiserate with him if he will allow himself to mourn for that little <br/>
boy that he was. And ask whether he&#39;s willing to work WITH you to keep <br/>
Romeo and the other children safe and comforted.<br/>

That&#39;s all fine and dandy, but your child also needs protection in the<br/>
heat of the moment. I would have NO problem letting my partner know<br/>
this is not acceptable and I will not stand by while the child is<br/>
being harmed. <br/>
