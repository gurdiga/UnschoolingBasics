<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558887171">Greetings to all from the snowy Upper Midwest!<br/>
<br/>
I am thrilled to report that The Unschooling Conference is getting off the ground.  We would appreciate any list/group/website postings or links that you think would be appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
Our conference will be one day only, Saturday, Feb 10, 2007, in Madison, WI.  Our focus is on the joys and successes of unschooling and deschooling.  Our keynote speaker will be Matt Hern .  <br/>
<br/>
For more about our conference, including registration information, please visit our website, www.unschoolingconference.com<br/>
<br/>
We are so excited about finally bringing an unschooling conference to Wisconsin and hope to meet many of you who are interested in alternative learning styles and lifestyles.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email with any questions or comments.<br/>
Tanya Cunningham<br/>

<br/>
The Unschooling Conference 2008  12 January 8am-5pm<br/>
www.unschoolingconference.com    <br/>
<br/>
H.O.M.E., a Madison-based homeschooling support group since 1986, will be hosting the second Unschooling Conference on January 12 from 8am-5pm at the Lussier Family Heritage Center, 3101 Lake Farm Road, Madison (in Lake Farm Park).  The Unschooling Conference is Wisconsins first and only conference devoted to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a variant of homeschooling which is learner-led, and not curriculum based.  The term unschooling was coined by John Holt, author of numerous books on education and educational alternatives.  Unschooling is an educational option that is available to all Wisconsin families.  Whether you consider yourself an unschooler already and are looking for community and inspiration, or youre curious about educational alternatives for your family, The Unschooling Conference welcomes you!<br/>
<br/>
Especially exciting for the conference this year is keynote speaker Manish Jain, of Shikshantar: The Peoples Institute for Rethinking Development and Education, located in Udaipur, India.  Find out more about Manish and the Institute at www.swaraj.org/shikshantar/<br/>
<br/>
It will be a day of inspiration and connection in a beautiful setting.  Find out more about the conference and find registration materials at  www.unschoolingconference.com <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-904276008">Yep. They did not have a &quot;place&quot; for them. Its only a one day Conference.<br/>
I was hoping they would work it out and find a place where they could have kids.<br/>
Since my mom is in Brazil I don&#39;t really have anyone I could take to another Sate with me to baby sit. My 23 month old <br/>
has never been away from me other thatn when she goes out shopping with daddy.  I call like every 10 minutes then and she is just peachy).<br/>
I was hopping to connect with area unschoolers but.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-318857497">From the conference organizer&#39;s blog, a discussion of why this nine hour, one <br/>
day, speakers only, vendor free conference does not include children-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So, now we wait (a little nervously) to see if there&#39;s anyone out there who <br/>
REALLY wants to come to Madison in the winter for this shindig!  We THINK you <br/>
do and HOPE you do, but in the end, it&#39;s a matter of trust....So, the party&#39;s <br/>
planned--Are you coming?<br/>
We periodically get questions that we chew on and make decisions about and <br/>
worry over....One recurring one is related to why we are not including our kids <br/>
at the conference.<br/>
This is a tough one, since it seems counter-intuitive that as unschoolers we <br/>
would leave our kids at home.  It&#39;s interesting to note, also that most of our <br/>
attendees last year said that they prefered to have the conference not <br/>
include children; that they liked to have a day to consider the issues the <br/>
conference presents in depth and without distractions.<br/>
It was initially our plan to evolve into an event that included kids.  <br/>
However, after a lot of consideration and searching for an appropriate venue, we <br/>
just couldn&#39;t find a place where we could reasonably and comfortably accomodate <br/>
large groups of kids. <br/>
<br/>
This is dictated a lot by our tiny resources, but also by the fact that with <br/>
the burgeoning number of conferences which have sprung up--we don&#39;t want to <br/>
make ourselves redundant by doing the same things that other groups are doing <br/>
better than we could.  After all, if we are going to go to the trouble, we want <br/>
to provide something unique that people actually want to come to.  If you want <br/>
an event that&#39;s really centered around children, try the InHome Conference in <br/>
Illinois <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeeducatorsconference.org/.%c2%a0">http://www.homeeducatorsconference.org/.%c2%a0</a> While this event is not <br/>
strictly unschooling in nature, that group does a FANTASTIC job of providing <br/>
interesting and fun kid activities.<br/>
The other thing is that dealing with the kids of highly-involved parents is <br/>
tricky and something that should only be undertaken (we think) where there is a <br/>
mutual understanding of parental expectations.  We hope you understand this <br/>
decision and that those of you who want this kind of experience for your kids <br/>
can find what you desire.<br/>
In the meantime, we&#39;re looking forward to seeing old friends and new at our <br/>
event!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626453829">But what happens is that not allowing children makes it impossible for someone like me ( coming 4 hours from Minnesota) to do come to the Conference.<br/>
I am lookomng for connecting with unschoolers. I am not looking into going to something like the homeschooling Conference in ILL. I connect with lots of homeschoolers here. After going to L and L I just NEED more unschoolers around me.<br/>
I cannot stand to talk about curriculums, how to make your kid do stuff, kids &quot;learning disabilities, and all that other stuff.<br/>
I hope next year you guys can find a way to allow kids or have a kids area.<br/>
I trully do not want to be away from my kids that long. Even my 5 yo ds needs me often.<br/>
