didn&#39;t connect for him until recently.  He is only reading very simple <br/>
words but the dots are starting to connect for him.  Ren&#39;s son was <br/>
over 12 when he started to read, he will be 13 this summer and you <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to tell that he just recently started reading because <br/>
he now reads well.<br/>

I think we push our kids to learn things that they are not ready for; <br/>
they will learn what they need, when they need <br/>
it...............................GUARANTEED!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170946673">My oldest wasn&#39;t ready to read until around eleven. It was as if a<br/>
light switch just turned on. Suddenly it wasn&#39;t difficult for her<br/>
anymore. My middle child is ten and I can see the same thing happening<br/>
with her now! <br/>
