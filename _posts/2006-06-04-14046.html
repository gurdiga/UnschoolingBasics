<div id="ygrps-yiv-183462114">&quot;In the second that rough paper doesn&#39;t absorb well, so you&#39;re saying<br/>
&quot;You might assume because that paper is rough that it wouldn&#39;t grab<br/>
color well BUT this particular paper does.&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I disagree. It was simply explaining two properities of the paper. I<br/>
suppose you wouldn&#39;t have to use &quot;but&quot;. In the Green example, it was<br/>
showing a way to tone down a green, not negating the fact that it was<br/>
green.<br/>
<br/>
I think the word &quot;but&quot; CAN negate the first half of a sentence, I<br/>
don&#39;t believe it ALWAYS does.<br/>
