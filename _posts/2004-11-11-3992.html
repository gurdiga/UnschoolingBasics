<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098426150">Thanks everyone....I am trying to go with the movie watching.  I <br/>
watched it, too, and thinks it&#39;s good, but am in my own tv-resistant <br/>
phase, so I am sure that has something to do with my attitude. <br/>
<br/>
Your responses have been very helpful.  I feel strongly that this <br/>
will be so wonderful once we get into the rhythm of freedom.  Dd goes <br/>
to sleep late, after getting very overtired/weepy/cranky, but most <br/>
days can sleep late and I am sure that the emotion will even out once <br/>
it becomes a routine. <br/>
<br/>
I will ahve to pass on your watching records to the Blockbuster guy!  <br/>
He told me three viewings was a local record.  I guess those other <br/>
kids were wasting their time in school LOL.<br/>
