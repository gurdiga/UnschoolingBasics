<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033872723">Hello there,<br/>
<br/>
my son, 15 months old, isn&#39;t eating anything else but Nutella  <br/>
(chocolate-nut-cream for bred), Jam, and chocolate, everything has to  <br/>
be sweetened and he&#39;s not eating anything &quot;healthy&quot; anymore like..  <br/>
just normal food for dinner or anything. We, trying to let him the  <br/>
freedom to choose, have been watching this development, allowing it  <br/>
(saying nothing and not restricting) since it started, like 2-3 weeks  <br/>
ago.<br/>
<br/>
Could you calm me down, please, and tell me, that he WILL eat  <br/>
something else later? Did your kids eat like that sometime and then  <br/>
started to eat normal again? I also fear allergies and fat :-) I jsut  <br/>
fear, he will &quot;never&quot; eat normal again, he&#39;s SO focused on Nutella  <br/>
and Jam! He&#39;s eating it with a SPOON, he doesn&#39;t even eat the bred  <br/>
under it anymore and yells for us to hand him the jam jar! Ah, yes,  <br/>
yesterday we had fish sticks with rice and he threw all the rice down  <br/>
on the floor, ate the fish but only screaming all the time for more  <br/>
and more ketchup until it was more like a ketchup-soup with little  <br/>
pieces of fish, which he kind of left over, since he only spooned the  <br/>
ketchup...<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052085688">Well, Nutella is more hazelnuts then chocolate, I wouldn&#39;t be that worried. <br/>
I&#39;d just make sure that there are lots of other things on offer. Maybe if <br/>
you offered him other nutella things. Here is a recipe site for nutella <br/>
based recipes: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.recipezaar.com/recipes.php?q=nutella">http://www.recipezaar.com/recipes.php?q=nutella</a> . Maybe you <br/>
could try dipping other things in the nutella, try apple slices or bananas <br/>
or strawberries. Or here&#39;s a recipe for homemade nutella: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.recipezaar.com/155936">http://www.recipezaar.com/155936</a> so you and your son could make it together.<br/>
<br/>
Make your own jam. Jam is good. Or buy homemade style jam. And in the spring <br/>
find a pick your own place (do they do pick your own&#39;s in Germany? It seems <br/>
like it, like the UK, would be a good place to find Pick Your Own farms.) <br/>
And go pick fruit in the field and bring them home and dip some in nutella <br/>
and make some into jam. Maybe if you see the process of making it you won&#39;t <br/>
be so worried about a diet based on nutella and jam. And, if you try and <br/>
incorporate other things into this diet maybe it will expand out into a diet <br/>
that is more flavored with nutella and jam than one that is based on nutella <br/>
and jam.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve eaten nutella with a spoon. Pre-menstrually I used to crave nutella, <br/>
there was no point sullying it with bread. And Linnaea has eaten a few jars <br/>
of David&#39;s homemade jam with a spoon. But it isn&#39;t all that she eats. Nor is <br/>
nutella all that I eat. Pat said, regarding the idea of avoiding foods with <br/>
additives: &quot;We found that ADDING<br/>
alternatives that were equal and preferable allowed foods with additives to <br/>
become obsolete.&quot; Maybe you need to see ways of taking what he loves and <br/>
adding other optionals to it.<br/>
<br/>
Its only been 2-3 weeks. I assume that before you were controlling his food. <br/>
It&#39;ll pass. I wrote once about Simon only eating donuts one day and how I <br/>
was disturbed by it. David (dh) told me not to worry, he wouldn&#39;t eat only <br/>
donuts forever. And he didn&#39;t. The next day he had other things. As long as <br/>
you have other things around. And offer them forward. I really like the idea <br/>
of trying dipping things in nutella. I can picture you and your son <br/>
wandering through the kitchen looking for different things to dip in <br/>
nutella. A bit of coconut or trying what an orange and nutella is like or <br/>
tofu or mango or carrots or cucumber r hard boiled eggs or melon. And <br/>
laughing at the stuff that doesn&#39;t work and loving the stuff that does.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030054380">Did he just recently have a growth spurt? Morgan&#39;s appetite goes <br/>
waaaay up right before a growth spurt but then evaporates after one. <br/>
Then if she eats anything its candy or cookies. She also tends to eat <br/>
sweets predominently if she&#39;s having a particular kind of stress, like <br/>
having or being a houseguest.<br/>
<br/>
I also notice that if she&#39;s *very* hungry she will eat sweets - he <br/>
body seems to want the instant gratification. So I do try to be <br/>
concious of how long it&#39;s been since she&#39;s eaten and offer her food <br/>
*before* she gets to that point.<br/>

There. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 Did your kids eat like that sometime and then<br/>

<br/>
Have you ever worked in a bakery? Or a sweets shop? Or ice cream? Have <br/>
you ever gotten so sick of something you never wanted to eat another <br/>
one---ever? (not physically sick---just sick & tired of it)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going through that now with chocolate (I know, I know! But it&#39;s <br/>
TRUE! &lt;g&gt;) I have two huge bowls of candy---one of M&Ms and one of <br/>
Hershey&#39;s kisses. I won&#39;t touch either of them. Chocolate is NOT <br/>
something I generally turn my nose up at. But I&#39;ve really just had <br/>
enough. I was up at Ren&#39;s last month. She&#39;d brought home a dozen <br/>
beautiful little chocolate truffles. I couldn&#39;t MAKE myself eat one. <br/>
Ask her---I didn&#39;t! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just received the most beautiful Holiday package from friends---FULL <br/>
of chocolates---Walker&#39;s and Godiva and Ghirradelli. I haven&#39;t touched <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Let him DIVE into Nutella ( I remember the first time *I* tried <br/>
it---WOW! I was hooked! Nutella on EVERYTHING!!! Oh---and especially on <br/>
a thick slice of Bauernbrot!!). He will really be OK. And he will start <br/>
eating other things again. Just keep new stuff around. Quit <br/>
forcing---but MUCH more important---QUIT WORRYING!!!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a possibility that the nutella and jam and catsup have <br/>
something in it he needs.<br/>
<br/>
Let him have the nutella jar. But leave some steamed, cooled green <br/>
beans or broccoli where he can reach it. Let him have all the jam he <br/>
wants, but leave some cheese and crackers where he can reach it. Give <br/>
him a bowl full of catsup, but set some scrambled or boiled eggs next <br/>
to it.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not going to die from Nutella poisoning! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

hoot. She wanted sandwiches, so we hunted for ways to make everything <br/>
into a chocolate sandwich. Tofu was the favorite.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-928590071">Hello Johanna,<br/>
<br/>
In your shoes, I honestly wouldn&#39;t sweat it another instant.  When I<br/>
was a child, I would generally eat the same thing for up to a year at<br/>
a time.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, a year.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it was a joyous cholesterol &quot;reducing&quot; food such as eggs,<br/>
and other times it was a diabetes &quot;preventing&quot; meal such as french<br/>
toast drenched in syrup and then covered with so much powdered sugar<br/>
that it looked like Mount Everest.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I turned out fine.  Many people go through phases of what<br/>
prefer to eat.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I would encourage, if you aren&#39;t already doing this, is to<br/>
make sure he&#39;s taking some sort of multi-vitamin.  Maybe a mixture<br/>
into his favorite drink, or some tasty chewables.<br/>
<br/>
That said, even if he&#39;s not having any multi-vitamins, he&#39;ll turn out<br/>
just fine.  This is a phase he needs to go through at this point in<br/>
time, and when he&#39;s ready he&#39;ll start looking to other foods.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070960063">Thank you all :-) that&#39;s what I needed. You&#39;ve given me some really  <br/>
good ideas and relieved my worries.<br/>
<br/>
Just to clarify though, I hadn&#39;t been restricting or controlling food  <br/>
before. He just ate other things before and started just now with jam  <br/>
and nutella and catsup. Funny, I did restrict foods for my daughter  <br/>
(7) before, though. And stopped restricting it a few months ago. It&#39;s  <br/>
so interesting to see how she&#39;s understanding now, that if you eat 16  <br/>
bars of a special kind of chocolate in one day and then continue  <br/>
eating this the next days, you just can&#39;t eat any of them anymore.  <br/>
She told me: &quot;Mama, please, could you remove the package, cause I  <br/>
can&#39;t even SEE it, I feel sick from just seeing it!&quot; Now she&#39;s done  <br/>
that with two or three different types of sweets and just now she&#39;s  <br/>
suspecting that this will always happen if she doesn&#39;t control it.  <br/>
Also, she noticed that chocolate is actually &quot;too sweet&quot; for her...  <br/>
Incredible, I learned that as an adult, happy to be able to eat what  <br/>
I wanted – she&#39;s learning that right now.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought that a 15 months old might not feel the same and only  <br/>
want sugar for the next years... just different kinds of sugar and  <br/>
sweets and maybe, I until he &quot;notices&quot;, he&#39;s already grown fat! But I  <br/>
guess I&#39;m worrying too much. Yesterday he ate a banana... I just have  <br/>
this picture of a fat baby eating lots of sugar and not wanting any  <br/>
vegetables and tipping everything in catsup and nutella forever and  <br/>
growing more and more fat... but maybe that happens only to children  <br/>
who are restricted in foods sometimes and then sometimes not, or  <br/>
whose parents openly say they don&#39;t like it so the children worry one  <br/>
day they won&#39;t be able to eat what they want anymore...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Greetings<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889012484">BTW there ARE organic forms of Nutella - at our house it&#39;s called<br/>
&quot;Nutella like substance&quot; - DS got a kick out of seeing his exact phrase<br/>
written down on the grocery list. Since it isn&#39;t precisely Nutella<br/>
(which is a brand name) that conveys well that we want the hazelnut<br/>
chocolate spread but not the brand name stuff. <br/>
 <br/>
Also, don&#39;t discount the beverages - odds are if he&#39;s eating a quantity<br/>
of Nutella, he&#39;s needing a beverage of some form. Make a nice yogurt<br/>
smoothie or something to go with the Nutella or just some good fruit<br/>
juice or plain milk (cow, goat, soy, whatever). There&#39;s probably a lot<br/>
more nutrition going in than it seems. Even &quot;ketchup soup with fish<br/>
bits&quot; is more than &quot;Only&quot; Nutella.<br/>
 <br/>
Nutella works really nicely in those &quot;thumbprint&quot; type cookies - make<br/>
some of your favorite oatmeal cookies and put a dollop of Nutella in the<br/>
center. Look for ways to make oatmeal cookie balls and use jam and/or<br/>
Nutella in the centers. We have a recipe for PB oatmeal raisin cookies<br/>
(using mashed banana and yogurt instead of sugar and butter) that would<br/>
work just as well with Nutella (hmm might make some of those this week!)<br/>
AND have the added benefit of the whole grains (oats, whole wheat<br/>
flour), yogurt, fruit (raisins, bananas).<br/>
 <br/>
It WILL pass - maybe, if the budget allows, buy half a dozen jars of<br/>
Nutella so that he knows there&#39;s no running out of it anytime soon.<br/>
Knowing it&#39;ll still be there tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow can help<br/>
today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271178865">After all, Nutella is still underneath it all, a protein containing<br/>
food. And the only other food mentioned, albeit under an ocean of<br/>
ketchup, was fish. Protein. Set out, earlier than he usually gets<br/>
hungry, little bits of protein that are fun - use mini cookie cutters to<br/>
make cheese shapes, buy string cheese if it&#39;s available, and so on. Do<br/>
fish sticks again and give him a small container (like a 4 oz yogurt<br/>
container) with ketchup in it so he can dip ketchup onto his fish sticks<br/>
to his heart&#39;s content. I used to *crave* ketchup sandwiches - just<br/>
plain ketchup on basic white bread. I think it was the acid, the vitamin<br/>
C, that I was needing at the time. Haven&#39;t done that in a long time -<br/>
mostly, I think, because I have a wider access to things with vitamin C<br/>
now than I did as a kid. Oh, also, my DS likes his oatmeal with Nutella<br/>
in it sometimes - good hearty breakfast really, with whole grains,<br/>
protein, the lot.<br/>

It&#39;s hard for a parent not to be concerned when the media and the whole medical community are up in arms about the rising obesity rate in american children (and americans in general) and the (supposed) correlation to chronic disease. But while they flaunt their studies every opportunity, I have trouble finding disputing data. Even on sites about dispelling myths about fat, or radical weight challenging zines, I can&#39;t find the data to dispute the fear mongering out there. Mostly just voiced frustration over living in a society obsessed with emaciated models and a refusal to talk about those serious health problems. So it seems to be a pendulum from one extreme to another.<br/>
I get a lot of questions about this from clients with respect to themselves and also their kids, and try and help people differentiate between the definition of &quot;obesity&quot; and being full figured, or slightly to moderately &quot;higher than the chart says&quot; in weight and also &quot;morbid obesity&quot; (a truly disrespectful medical definition) wherein most of the grim predictions lay. But I have heard fat activists challenge the whole idea that there is an increased rate of disease among those who meet the definition of obese period, yet I can&#39;t find the data on this.<br/>
I would also be interested to find it because I have a good friend who has been working for a while on a large scale study at Penn here, about obesity rates in children who have at least one parent who meets the criteria for extreme obesity. He does data complitation and holds strongly to the medical paradigm that overweight= more health problems, but was intrigued by my telling him that some folks dispute the data altogether.<br/>
His take is that malnutrition which is often a cofactor with obesity in kids is the real determinant of health problems, but also maintains the overly simplistic belief that proper nutrition leads to some magical range of &quot;proper&quot; weight. <br/>
Anyhow, if anyone has any references for data on this issue I would love to get a copy.<br/>
