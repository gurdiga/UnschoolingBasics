<div id="ygrps-yiv-865390225">I&#39;m not sure this is appropriate to post or not, but from reading the <br/>
unschooling lists, I know the older kids seem to be into video games, <br/>
so there will be people who would know about this. (My husband and I <br/>
both have had no exposure to video games since our childhoods when <br/>
Atari games first came out! LOL) <br/>
<br/>
My oldest son is almost 5 1/2 and he loves to play some of the free <br/>
online games we&#39;ve found on candystand and miniclips, etc. He <br/>
especially likes racing sort of games. (Any other recommendations for <br/>
this sort that are easy for young kids to manuever would be great <br/>
too.) We have a few preschool/kindergarden age gamee on CDs and have <br/>
checked them out from the library before that are on the <br/>
more &quot;educational&quot; side and he sometimes likes them, but usually not, <br/>
and only the parts that aren&#39;t obviously trying to teach him letters, <br/>
words, etc. We have only one computer right now but he likes to be <br/>
near me all the time, so I&#39;ve been thinking that he might enjoy one <br/>
of those handheld video games for kids, so he could carry it with him <br/>
outside/upstairs if his younger brother wanted to do something away <br/>
from the computer area, but I don&#39;t really know anything about them. <br/>
Does anyone have any recommendations for machines/brands and for <br/>
specific games. Feel free to recommend older models that I might find <br/>
on Craig&#39;s List or something (I&#39;m guessing the new ones are pretty <br/>
pricey--although Grandma would probably be happy to get one for him <br/>
for Christmas.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629206265">My ds (almsot 6) loves his nintendo DS lite. It is about $120. It is worth<br/>
it to us. He plays it daily. He uses it when we are out to create a safe<br/>
zone. It is fun. He and I play pokemon together on it. So it can even be<br/>
social :-) He and his sister play multi-player games.<br/>
A few years ago we were gifted a game boy (also ninetendo). There are still<br/>
current games for that. There are also a huge amount of older used games<br/>
cheap. And if you do &quot;upgrade&quot; to a DS later all those games are compatible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I figure that the DS cost us 120 about 10 months ago. And we bought or<br/>
aquired about 8 games (100 dollars). SO for 220 or 22 a month he has a huge<br/>
resource that brings him great joy. That&#39;s less than a dollar per day. And<br/>
we still have it. My dd has had her DS for 2 years so the cost per day is<br/>
some change.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006656657">Our older kids have DS lites, we have the old DS for the younger kids  <br/>
because they are sturdier hinged and have thicker cases (after losing  <br/>
a DS lite to secondary war wounds...we figure this out)<br/>
<br/>
The old DS are wireless just like the new ones, and accept the same  <br/>
games. They are also about $50 less expensive and easier to find  <br/>
used. My five yo has Cars for racing, but he loves Animal Crossing  <br/>
(controlling his minions is a lot of fun)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491397029">Nintedo DS is the way to go. Great games. He can play with other people.<br/>
Takes Nintendo DS games and GameBoy games ( that you can find very cheap)<br/>
I usually shop for used games either on GameStop or on Amanzon.<br/>
The Nintendo DS goes for $ 129 and is very hard to find used but not impossible.<br/>
Also there are great games that I love to play.<br/>
Having had 3 and all three broke down ( we pretty careful)I would be very careful when buying used<br/>
as even the 2nd screen ( one you can write on) can be damaged and not work properly.<br/>
They do come with a one year limited warranty and Nintendo is pretty good about it ( I had my Wii sent twice and it was great)<br/>
If you plan on getting it for Christmas I would buy it NOW as they run out of then in the next few weeks of November and you cannot find them for Christmas until next year.<br/>
My son got his DS when he was 4 and a half years old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050580705">My 5 yr old broke a Nintendo DS Lite that my 6 yr old got for<br/>
Christmas. He just opened it too hard, too many times and broke the<br/>
hinge that holds it together. So, looking back, some kind of<br/>
protective case may have been a good idea. But, I didn&#39;t know they<br/>
existed at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we bought a Nintendo Gameboy Advance for $5 at a yard sale and<br/>
they both LOVE that.. it seems to be a lot more sturdy in design and<br/>
it hasn&#39;t broken. The games are cheaper, plus you can find lots of<br/>
them at flea markets or game stores. <br/>
<br/>
I would go with the Gameboy Advance, since it is more sturdy and a lot<br/>
cheaper to try it out before investing the money into a DS Lite. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092557052">We bought Megan a DS this summer.  She was six when we bought it and she&#39;s had a birthday since then.  We paid $129 for it.  It was a great purchase for our family.<br/>
<br/>
The games are usually about $30 (new).  We belong to Gamefly and pay $15 to have one game out at a time.  Gamefly is great for Megan. She is very specific about which games she wants to play and Gamefly has a large selection.  She likes to check out the graphics of a game before she orders it and Gamefly has screen shots as well as reviews.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a DS that I bought so I could play games with Megan (some of the games are multi-player, but you only need one copy of the game).  I also use my DS to keep Zoe(2) distracted when Megan wants to play and Zoe wants to help.  I also have a couple of games (Brain Age which Megan isn&#39;t interested in and Elite Beat Agents which Megan is very good at)<br/>
<br/>
Right now Megan is playing &quot;Littlest Pet Shop: Jungle&quot;.  We got it yesterday.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225887783">Ryan (5) and Ethan (8) both LOVE their Nintendo DS games. They can play with<br/>
us and with each other and with their friends. They can even use our<br/>
wireless Internet connection adn play with their friends in other states.<br/>
We&#39;re looking into getting an R4 which is a kind of memory stick/cartridge<br/>
that allows you to download games from the net for free. I can&#39;t say enough<br/>
good things about the DS. One thing I do recommend is the Nerf case. It&#39;s a<br/>
great way to protect the DS.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046824688">My ds doesn&#39;t read yet. most games are very compatible with that. The ones<br/>
that require reading I play with him or make myself available for reading<br/>
when it comes up. Usually though the reading is just needed to set up the<br/>
game. Once they done it a few times they can navigate it without reading.<br/>
Even games like pokemon with a lot of reading my ds does fine on without me.<br/>
He knows which moves are which, I am not sure how but he does.<br/>
My ds was into a leapster (we had one gifted) for a little while but the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172694304">DS vs. DS Lite- The primary differences are that the Lite:<br/>
<br/>
    * Is smaller<br/>
    * Has a brighter screen<br/>
    * Has better battery life<br/>
<br/>
The advantage of the smaller size is one of personal choice. Some people <br/>
(myself included) actually like the larger form factor; also GBA carts <br/>
don&#39;t stick out of the Phat. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 From a software perspective, they are equivalent. A new version, the <br/>
DSi, was just released in Japan. This model adds support for <br/>
downloadable content (think WiiWare), but removes the GameBoy Advance <br/>
slot (slot 2) as well as adding an SD slot and two cameras. It is too <br/>
early to tell, but there is some concern that there may be software <br/>
incompatibilities between the DS and DSi. (We in the US will know better <br/>
next summer.)<br/>
<br/>
Finding accessories for a DS Phat is a bit harder as the model has been <br/>
out of production for a while.<br/>
<br/>
As for games for non-readers- I don&#39;t have any good suggestions. DD <br/>
started playing with the GBA at around 5, but usually had one of us <br/>
nearby to read various messages/prompts.<br/>

My son does not have the baggage of being in school and it is not the &quot;educationalese&quot; that turns him off <br/>
from those games. He too used to like them until we got him a DS. <br/>
I have played both those with him and I got to tell you that the &quot;educational&quot; ones are just plain boring, silly, slow and lack in graphics and fun content.<br/>
Not to mention sometimes plain stupid and condescending. <br/>
Period!Sure some  are OK and some are better than others as I am just generalizing.<br/>
But the difference can be huge between them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Not to mention sometimes plain stupid and condescending. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that is my sense of them, too.  Maybe a game rental sort of deal<br/>
would be good for us, to find DS games she likes.  I&#39;m a bit<br/>
overwhelmed looking at a list of hundred games I know nothing about. <br/>
We&#39;ve played Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon on a gamecube and I see<br/>
these have DS versions.  Those might be a place to start.  Any other<br/>
standouts for little kiddos?  Friendly, not too much reading or<br/>
violence, not too complicated, fun...<br/>
<br/>
Also,sounds like the older DS are sturdier and possibly more available<br/>
used, while the DS Lite are fancier, pricier, a bit flimsier, a bit<br/>
niftier.  Is that right?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

&gt; from those games. He too used to like them until we got him a DS.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-245211660">I&#39;d like to pop in and make a recommendation based on the durability of the Nintendo DS. <br/>
<br/>
We bought my son a DS for his birthday. About 2 months after we bought it, the touch screen stopped working. I called Nintendo and they were amazing!! They checked the warranty based on the number on the bottom of the handheld....I never filled out a warranty card. They then emailed us a prepaid fedex label (both ways). We dropped it off wrapped and ready to ship at a local Kinko&#39;s. The game was mailed back within 2 weeks, repaired and with the warranty extended to cover any further problems for another year. <br/>
<br/>
In a world where you buy it one month and replace it the next, it was a breath of fresh air! If durability is your concern, based on my experience, Nintendo is a safe route to go. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059135483">My daughter has always liked Animal Crossing, all the Spyro games,<br/>
Pokemon,  anything with Mario or Sonic the hedgehog etc.  My son seems<br/>
to prefer the ones like Cars, Speedracer, Star wars... any of the lego<br/>
versions of the DS games (or the ones for non hand held!) he loves!  <br/>
When the characters battle the loser breaks into individual lego<br/>
pieces and skitters across the floor which he finds hilarious !   Both<br/>
of my younger kids have had a DS or some version of it since around<br/>
age 5 ... they sometimes needed a reader to help with something but<br/>
not that much... my daughter actually learned to read from playing<br/>
Animal Crossing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613539926">I ran across a bin sale in the mall yesterday (store going out of  <br/>
business) and was able to get a bunch of used DS games for $10 each  <br/>
(Crayola something or other, Kirby&#39;s something, Yoshi&#39;s Island, Animal  <br/>
Genus, a Miss Spider game).  Seemed so serendipitous that I decided on  <br/>
the spot that we were diving in, and I picked up a DS LIte.  I had  <br/>
been thinking of Christmas, but I kind of doubt I&#39;ll be able to wait  <br/>
so long to give it, haha.  Thanks everyone for your suggestions!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874544547">That is interesting. It was not my experience with Nintendo. I called to get<br/>
my sons hinge fixed and was told they don&#39;t cover plastic cracks or breaks.<br/>
But I talked to the woman on the phone who was very nice and listened to my<br/>
concerns. Originally they wanted to charge me $75 and me to pay shipping,<br/>
even though it was in warranty (it is 8 months old) but then she said she<br/>
could do it with no charge and sent mailing labels. It worked out alright<br/>
but I was bummed that I had to be so assertive with my needs (I am not so<br/>
good at that).<br/>

If your kids are really into it, this is one that I would recommend<br/>
the official game guide.  Drew has spent hours pouring over it.  It<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161177170">I&#39;m actually trying to consider, for us, whether to get a couple of DS<br/>
Lites, or a PS2. Our family dynamic is this: 4 children all up.  2<br/>
older boys love the xbox and want to have it in their room if they buy<br/>
their own small TV set. For a long time I&#39;ve realised that in terms of<br/>
games consoles for the TV, the PS2 is much more suitable to younger<br/>
ages.  My 2 younger ones are 8 & 6 and would certainly love all that<br/>
the PS2 has to offer, including Buzz, Singstar and the large variety<br/>
of games.  <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m wondering is, do I get a PS2, which we can all use together<br/>
and have lots of &quot;family fun&quot;, is great to use when other kids come to<br/>
play, and can also be used solo, or do I get TWO DS Lites (I&#39;d have to<br/>
have at LEAST two, because I have 4 children), for twice the money?? <br/>
I know there is the advantage of portability, and there is a large<br/>
variety of games (even the Brain Training stuff - does anyone have any<br/>
experience with those??), but I just wonder if the PS2 is better for a<br/>
large family?<br/>
<br/>
Keen for some suggestions, and excited that I&#39;ve finally reached a<br/>
place of DELIGHTING in their gaming and wanting to provide for it,<br/>
rather than fearing it and resenting their love of it.  Yay!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I can get a PS2 for the same price as ONE DS lite, but the reality is<br/>
that I&#39;d actually need to <br/>

Yes, that is my sense of them, too.  Maybe a game rental sort of deal<br/>
would be good for us, to find DS games she likes.  I&#39;m a bit<br/>
overwhelmed looking at a list of hundred games I know nothing about. <br/>
We&#39;ve played Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon on a gamecube and I see<br/>
these have DS versions.  Those might be a place to start.  Any other<br/>
standouts for little kiddos?  Friendly, not too much reading or<br/>
violence, not too complicated, fun...<br/>
<br/>
Also,sounds like the older DS are sturdier and possibly more available<br/>
used, while the DS Lite are fancier, pricier, a bit flimsier, a bit<br/>
niftier.  Is that right?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-375861170">Have you asked all your kids their preference? If you can only spare X<br/>
amount of money for gaming right now they are the best people to help you<br/>
(the family) decide how to spend it.<br/>

Personally we got our DS&#39;s first but that is just where my kids were at the<br/>
time. We would probably do it differently now in the same situation. You can<br/>
pick up used systems with loads of games fairly cheap on craigslist.<br/>
