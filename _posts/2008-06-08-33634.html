<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964272726">Hi all,<br/>
I began homeschooling my then 7 year old daughter in Sept 2007.  I am a<br/>
single mom homeschooling a single child and loving it.<br/>
<br/>
I made it through the first year!  Honestly, even though I had some<br/>
tragedies in my life this year, we have absolutely loved our first year<br/>
hsing.<br/>
<br/>
I started out wanting to unschool, freaked out and changed my mind and<br/>
now; after the first &#39;year&#39; am going back to unschooling.  It was my<br/>
first instinct and the more I read, the more I love.<br/>
<br/>
I still feel like I don&#39;t know what I am doing most of the time, but<br/>
it&#39;s a more controlled &#39;out of control&#39; feeling. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say hello and thank everyone for all the helpful<br/>
information I have gleamed from this group.<br/>
