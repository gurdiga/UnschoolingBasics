<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689722113">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Coleen Kosan and  I am a graduate student. I am working on completing my Masters of Education in Curriculum and Instruction. My husband and I have been unschooling our two boys for 17 years. I am beginning my research for my thesis and the focus will be unschooling and Project-Based Learning (PBL) as a learning option( not required).  I will be conducting an anonymous and confidential survey to gather the information.  The answers are confidential and I do not see emails, names or any other sensitive information from the participants. If you choose to take the survey  you give me consent to be a participant.  If someone chooses not to participate then they simply delete this email :)<br/>
The url to take the survey is: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DYF8YJT">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DYF8YJT</a> <br/>

Happy Learning<br/>
