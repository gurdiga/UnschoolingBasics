<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878299147">I too am glad that I came to my senses before my two younger children will be subjected to school.  I have been bracing myself for the unwanted questions and advice as we embark on this journey and have come to the conclusion that I will compile a list of media that can do the talking for me and refuse to have the conversation.  I will gladly discuss my theories with perfect strangers, in fact my best friend and I are planning on starting a public blog, but I&#39;d rather not experience the range of emotions that will emerge if my mother-in-law or anyone else in my family forces me to feel that I have to defend my parenting style.  Good Luck.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You could say that right now you feel he needs to be home, but that you can always put him back in school when he feels the need to be there, or something along those lines. Sometimes it is easier to just not bring it up. Talk about other things and don&#39;t initiate conversations about your unschooling or parenting choices. If she brings it up keep it relatively neutral and calm and do what you can to not feel like you are on the defensive about your family&#39;s choices. And change the subject. Move on to talking about other things. You don&#39;t have to do it abruptly, answer whatever question was asked and then ask something back that is on a new topic. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to know that you won&#39;t have the support of friends and family when you feel the need for support. They won&#39;t be the people to turn to when things get hard or frustrating. They&#39;ll be more likely to say I told you so than to say well, if you look at it this way, or maybe you are just having a hard time seeing all these amazing things. And with that in mind you have to move away from leaning on them for engaging and supportive conversations about unschooling. <br/>

Groove that might help you find an inner calmness about being  <br/>
questioned:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; :: Don&#39;t Explain ::<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Being on the leading edge of parenting, you may<br/>
&gt; find yourself explaining to others *why* you parent<br/>
&gt; the way you do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This can be a good thing when someone has<br/>
&gt; expressed curiosity about it and you&#39;re simply<br/>
&gt; sharing information. But it&#39;s better *not* to explain<br/>
&gt; yourself if you&#39;re trying to *justify* your choices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Justifying gives away your power. It implies that<br/>
&gt; you need the other person&#39;s approval. It undermines<br/>
&gt; your self-confidence and distances you from your<br/>
&gt; Inner Guidance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The &quot;need&quot; to explain and justify your choices is<br/>
&gt; based on the &quot;need&quot; to be right. But if your parenting<br/>
&gt; choices are &quot;right,&quot; and the other person would parent<br/>
&gt; differently, then s/he must be &quot;wrong.&quot; Once you get<br/>
&gt; in that right/wrong mode, conflict or interpersonal<br/>
&gt; tension is inevitable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Instead of explaining your parenting to others,<br/>
&gt; silently remind *yourself* that your choices are right<br/>
&gt; *for you*, and your own approval is all you need.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s helpful to see from your relatives&#39; point of view. Their  <br/>
questions are because they care and because they&#39;re scared. What  <br/>
you&#39;re doing flies in the face of their understanding of how the  <br/>
world works so the fact that you&#39;re considering it suggests you&#39;re  <br/>
out of touch with reality! It&#39;s like you&#39;re saying &quot;I&#39;ll be jumping  <br/>
off the cliff with my son because I believe I can fly.&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd has used &quot;If this stops working, we&#39;ll try something else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That won&#39;t satisfy your sister, though! She&#39;s going to think you&#39;re  <br/>
digging a deeper and deeper hole that will be hard to get out of. So  <br/>
you can say that while what she says makes sense -- which it does! --  <br/>
that you&#39;ve been doing a  lot of reading and know from real life  <br/>
unschoolers that it take very little time for unschooled kids to  <br/>
catch up when they try school. And then give her some resources to  <br/>
read and tell her you&#39;d be happy to discuss it once she&#39;s done her  <br/>
homework and is up to speed with where you are ;-)<br/>

My son should need 13 years to &quot;catch up&quot; then!! ;) He&#39;s going to college this fall after being unschooled for most of his life (went to kindergarten and endured a few years of eclectic homeschooling).<br/>
His fiance is starting her third year of college this fall, after being unschooled most of her life too. Almost straight A&#39;s. Not that it matters but it proves you don&#39;t need to endure years and years of formal education to do well at formal education!<br/>
<br/>
I think most adult brains are more wired to be ready for that kind of information, should they desire it. What a waste of time school is for all those children who are simply enduring. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I&#39;m with the pro-school members of the family I take care not to criticize schools because that would put them on the defensive. I just don&#39;t talk about things that will start a fight. I switch the conversation to things that we can agree on. <br/>
<br/>
For example, once when asked about curriculum, I responded by saying that I could drop materials that weren&#39;t working and switch to those that do. And that I felt sorry that teachers had to use what the district provided. That went over well with the other grandmother who had been a math teacher and liked the idea that I thought teachers should be able to choose the books they wanted to work from. (On one of the ed blogs I read, a math teacher was crying because they took away Saxon and were substituting books he does not believe in. If his students don&#39;t do well, he will be blamed as a poor teacher. Take away his tools, give him shoddy substitutes, and blame him for the poor outcome!) <br/>
<br/>
In your case, if your teaching sister brings up preparation for college again, you might start talking about how many students start college poorly prepared, how all colleges, even the most elite, have remedial classes, and what a burden it is for people to pay college tuition for what was already bought and and paid for on the high school level. <br/>

Nursing is the biological norm for mothers and babies. It is a relationship that links the baby&#39;s immune system to the mother&#39;s, provides the baby with stimulation and connection while providing the mother with stress reducing hormones. It even feeds the baby. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-354587531">Do you remember when you were pregnant? Didn&#39;t everyone have advice about what you should be doing? And then when the babies were born? Everyone knew just how to raise them. And what to do when they fussed or what you should feed them or how they should be dressed.<br/>
<br/>
This is that sort of advice, imo. Offered whether you asked or not. Well-meaning but completely disconnected from your actual child. And, after a while, you learn to filter -- nodding and smiling and then proceeding to do what you know is best for you and yours. <br/>
<br/>
And, to top that off, your sister is a ps teacher. What has she spent the past years learning about? How valuable what she does for a living, and no doubt works hard at and is underpaid for, is for all children. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to see how she thinks every child should have the benefit of the system she believes in. Heck, my husband installs tile and marble -- I think everyone should have tile floors. :) Now, translate that to something really important, her love of your children as their aunt, and imagine how strange and insulting it is to her to reject everything she believes in. <br/>
<br/>
What to say though? Read online about the many success stories of kids who have gone on to have brilliant college or business careers. Yes, that&#39;s part of the story. But not the point. The point is the happiness and well-being of your actual children. <br/>
<br/>
My son went to ps briefly. He lasted for 7 months of Kindergarten. The problem? He could already read and he was trying to be good but he was really, really bored. And they never taught him anything new. That was his big complaint when I finally asked why he seemed so sad. A sad 6-year-old? My 6-year-old? Sad? Break my heart! Well, he was out of there pretty swiftly but not as a rejection of the ps system for everyone. Just that it didn&#39;t fit him. <br/>
<br/>
This grew into DD staying home and now we have been home for over 10 years. But DD has decided she wants to return to ps for high school. <br/>
<br/>
So we are doing what fits our particular children. Using the ps system when it works and rejecting it when it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be a big battle about the system with your sister. And it doesn&#39;t have to be about some hypothetical teen. This is about your actual child. And his needs now and as they change. <br/>
<br/>
And like the other decisions you have made for your babies, you don&#39;t need your sister&#39;s permission or agreement. And if it turns out that she can&#39;t see that the best path for your son is to homeschool, there are other things to discuss. You could ask her how things are going in school now that her funding has been cut (the typical school story around here).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101696751">Schuyler&#39;s advice is what worked for us, too. I would just say &quot;for now&quot; <br/>
or &quot;for the time being&quot; when someone well-meaning would ask about or try <br/>
to judge our unschooling. It worked from kindergarten age right through <br/>
to Favorite Daughter&#39;s present as university scholarship junior at age <br/>
19, backpacking around Europe.  Every year I&#39;d be asked, &quot;So do you <br/>
think she&#39;ll go to school next year then?&quot; And I&#39;d say &quot;we&#39;ll see&quot; or <br/>
quote the recurring line from Shakespeare in Love when asked how things <br/>
would work out: &quot;I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s a mystery!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it really was a mystery. I had confidence we&#39;d be fine whatever came <br/>
along, but couldn&#39;t predict how, and have often been surprised.  So <br/>
think about it: if YOU can&#39;t predict it, how can relatives or neighbors <br/>
or teachers or anyone, however well-meaning? When your unschooling kids <br/>
are little, learning not to fear nor force the future might be the most <br/>
important kind of learning, for both parent and child. :)<br/>
<br/>
Not that our unschooling mystery will predict how yours will turn out <br/>
but I was quite right to believe it would turn out well: with no <br/>
schooling, not even any parental planning or pushing, no formal study in <br/>
any high school &quot;subjects&quot; (plus a latent disorder/disability in math <br/>
coding, as it turned out) she HAS learned everything she needs and <br/>
wants, to be where she wants to be, doing what she wants to do and <br/>
charting her own wide-open future.  When she got to college, it turned <br/>
out that English, theatre and film professors were excited to get their <br/>
hands on someone who hadn&#39;t been schooled and tested into comformity.  <br/>
Here&#39;s a sample from when she was 16, about what kids learn from their <br/>
parents and other adults whether they are schooled or not:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://misedjj.wordpress.com/2006/10/24/i-cant-hear-you-lalalala/">http://misedjj.wordpress.com/2006/10/24/i-cant-hear-you-lalalala/</a><br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile she grappled with the math and science she&#39;d never studied, <br/>
and came through in her own ways that I&#39;d never have predicted, and <br/>
feels good about it now.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s my advice to add to Schuyler&#39;s.  It will all work out.<br/>
How?<br/>
It&#39;s a mystery!<br/>

Something I did with my dad was to say &quot;I&#39;ve been doing a lot of research on this, would you like me to email you some links?&quot; I think I sent him the link to A to Z&#39;s Home&#39;s Cool first, which is a mammoth homeschooling informational site - it makes Sandra&#39;s look like the back of a cereal box in comparison. Overwhelming enough to make the point I wanted. Most people who are invested in school have No Idea how much information is available to homeschoolers these days. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, I tried to stay out of direct conversations about homeschooling and didn&#39;t even talk about unschooling until recently. Now George and I are both confident enought to say &quot;unschooling&quot; and not be too phased by questions. Its easier with a teen - unschooling teens are just so cool! So its a delight to answer questions like &quot;he so nice, what&#39;s your secret&quot; with &quot;we took him out of school and he turned back into a human being.&quot; Snippy, but essentially true.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter will be beginning college in the fall at a small private college that she applied to and won a substantial scholarship based on academic merit after being unschooled for most of her school career!   There were many girls there that had attended private and public schools that had placed in remedial courses in order to be ready to take on the standard curriculum for their intended majors.   My daughter will be taking an intermediate algebra before taking college algebra but she has a math LD so that makes sense in the scheme of things... the school she attended as a young child tested her for a math LD ... found the math LD but said her IQ was so high that they were just going to wait for her to fail before helping her because she was doing fine in their eyes (getting more frustrated each year, spending hours on math homework, in tears each afternoon because she didn&#39;t understand it etc).   <br/>
<br/>
Anyway long story short... my child does not need a period of &quot;catching up&quot; to attend college nor do most homeschooled children(whether unschooled or more traditionally homeschooled).   The college that my daughter will be attending was very complimentary about homeschooling and worked with us to get all traditional documentation they needed translated from our homeschooling records.   I wrote up course descriptions and included most of our nontraditional methods and outside activities in these descriptions which they were very impressed by.   I think there are lists somewhere out there of colleges that are considered to be &quot;homeschooler friendly&quot;  ... I would venture to say that most colleges fit that description as we applied to 4 state schools that also were very homeschooler friendly and 2 private colleges that were very homeschooler friendly.   Perhaps your sister just needs to know that colleges understand and accept that homeschoolers may arrive with nontraditional transcripts but are every bit as prepared (and more in most cases) to attend college and succeed! <br/>

rarely and not recently(not in the past 2 years) opened a textbook or <br/>
studied any &quot;academic&quot; subject in a formal way(and voluntarily when he <br/>
did), took the CAT 5 9th grade test this spring as part of the NYS state <br/>
homeschooling reporting regulations that we  comply with. I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have thought to test him otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
He scored above the 90% national percentile for 6 of the 10 tests. 85% <br/>
percentile overall. Now, this is completely irrelevant information, but <br/>
I find it to be quite amusing.<br/>
<br/>
It reinforces my thoughts that spending time on preparing for these <br/>
types of tests is truly and utterly a waste of time. Perhaps some people <br/>

It helps if you can give up the need to have other people understand and agree that you are doing the right thing.  I find it easier now after 3 years to explain how we choose to live because I am not invested in anyone agreeing with me.  On the occaions friends ask about it I&#39;ll talk about unschooling and usually wrap up with it&#39;s been a good decision for me and Lizzy and leave it at that.  <br/>

composing music(upright and electric bass), gaming(Wii games, Starcraft, <br/>
Dungeons and Dragons, poker, Magic the Gathering), playing <br/>
sports(soccer, skateboarding, mountainbiking, basketball), working, <br/>
doing apprenticeships with a luthier and a sound engineer. He did do <br/>
some 6th/7th grade Saxon,  a couple of years ago. Apparently he learned <br/>
enough about various things to figure out what was wanted on the tests.<br/>
<br/>
My younger daughter took some tests also- and scored high on language <br/>
and reading, low on math.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t neccesarily lead to high test scores, but it can. <br/>
Same as schools. Some people are good at tests and &quot;academic&quot; subjects <br/>
whether they have been to school or not, just as lots of people are good <br/>
at many many other very useful and interesting things.  Increasingly it <br/>
amazes me that so many people are so focused on those narrow measures of <br/>
success. (not applying to anything from this list- just a general <br/>
impression.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I am new to unschooling my kids, but I can say that for me success in university had absolutely nothing to do with public school. I left hs in grade 9, with occasional forays into some alternate ed programs thereafter, never completed anything beyond grade 8 maths or sciences because I didn&#39;t enjoy them. When I finally decided to go to school at 27, I did a placement test, scored in the top percentiles for everything except algebraic math and went on the graduate from university on the deans list while single parenting my young son. I could have upgraded maths and done something else, but chose to do a program that was up my alley that didn&#39;t have any math requirements. I do think I might have struggled if I had tried to go the math route, not because I hadn&#39;t learned it before but because I still don&#39;t enjoy all the rote learning involved. I find it tedious and can&#39;t get excited about it like I can with other schooly things like writing papers, which I loved.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my point is that from my experience and from older unschoolers I know personally and from online, I am absolutely not worried about academics for children and it is not usually one of the criticisms that gets my hackles up ( I have others ). It sounds like it is still a worry for you though, so probably having some more success stories you can call up in your mind when other&#39;s doubts start to get to you could help. I find my need to defend is generally related to my own fear and doubt, so soothing that for myself keeps me calm, relaxed and confident and that just comes through in my responses. <br/>
<br/>
I am dealing with my son&#39;s dad (ex-partner) and his family including a sister who is a teacher, who are really not happy that I decided to take him out of school, have been threatening court, etc. I almost wrote back a big defensive email to the recent concerns and then read Scott Noelle&#39;s post that has been reprinted here and remembered how confident I am that this is the right choice for us. So instead of sounding cornered and defensive in my response, I believe (hope) I sounded calm, confident and assured as well as understanding of his concern. When other people do question, I give them a little quip about Terran wanting to read for more than 15 minutes a day and not really wanting to glue cotton balls on construction paper and leave it at that unless they suddenly become very interested and start asking meaningful questions, which happens more often than I would have imagined.</div>

 </span></blockquote>What unschooled kids learn from math found in daily life is what  <br/>
schooled kids miss out on: how numbers and concepts work. They learn  <br/>
that numbers are fluid and, from seeing various concepts in different  <br/>
contexts, why someone would want to multiply or use percentage and so  <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
What schooled kids get is a lot of practice at notation and number  <br/>
crunching. The hope is that an understanding of the concepts will  <br/>
come from doing lots and lots of problems. But it&#39;s very very hard to  <br/>
grasp the concepts when the numbers are taken out of context and  <br/>
stripped of meaning. (Like trying to memorize vocabulary and grammar  <br/>
rules for a language you&#39;ve never used.) It&#39;s just confusing to kids  <br/>
to be made to do 17.3% of 128.91 when it has no meaning. But  <br/>
unschooled kids are more likely to grasp the concept of percentage  <br/>
when they&#39;ve been using it to figure out how much tax will be added  <br/>
to a purchase, how much tip to leave, how much power they have left,  <br/>
how much to shrink a picture to fit it on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much much easier to figure out the notation after you grasp the  <br/>
concepts rather than the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn began formal math at 14 in her father&#39;s college statistics  <br/>
class and had no problems. He had probably shown her Fibonacci  <br/>
numbers and a few other cool things. They read the Number Devil  <br/>
together. But basically is was math found in real life used for real  <br/>
things she cared about (allowance, buying things). Probably the  <br/>
biggest was video games :-)<br/>
