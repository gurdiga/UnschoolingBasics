But  because we were controlling their every move for so <br/>
long, they are still  in the mindset of, &quot;If I ask Mom she&#39;ll say no, <br/>
so I&#39;ll just go ahead and  do it anyway and suffer the punishment <br/>
later.&quot; We&#39;re all still getting  used to this &quot;YES&quot; thing &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

The &quot;Yes&quot; thing will also eliminate the need for sneakiness and lying  as <br/>
well as the inevitable punishments!<br/>
