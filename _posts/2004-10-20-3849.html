<div id="ygrps-yiv-224240997"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; We have a bazillion pets of the &quot;non-long-living&quot; kind so the kids have seen it up close.  In fact, we have a pet cemetary in the goat pen, complete with crosses (which is weird considering I&#39;m pagan &lt;grin&gt;).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes; in our tradition we believe that there is a &quot;circle of life&quot;  We are born, we die, we are reborn.  Our physical bodies go through cycles of life and death as well.  We&#39;ve had pets and family members die.  Recently I had a young cousin (young enough that he called me &quot;Aunt Michelle&quot;) die.  Josh was only 21.  We had celebrated his 21st birthday just 3 months before he was killed.  My girls took it very hard, especially my oldest who idolized Josh.  The &quot;how&quot; questions were easy to answer.  The &quot;why&quot; questions were harder.  Having to talk about the &quot;fairness&quot; of it.  <br/>
