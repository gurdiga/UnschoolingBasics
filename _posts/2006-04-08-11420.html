<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959764121">I&#39;ve just received the Home Study Packet from the state that I have to fill out. They seem to want specific books & topics that I will cover next year and I&#39;m unsure how to fill out the paperwork correctly & still be able to unschool. Obviously I want their &quot;approval&quot; on my paperwork.<br/>
   <br/>
  How do I give them specific books & resources I&#39;ll use when I&#39;m not sure where my son&#39;s interests will take him?<br/>
   <br/>
  Thank you<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What does it *really* say?  I mean literally word by word?  It might seem<br/>
like it means specific books and resources but it if it is worded, &quot;What<br/>
books and resources do you intend to use?&quot;  That is very broad.  You can<br/>
say, &quot;We intend to use a wide spectrum of books too numerous to list from a<br/>
multitude of sources including (but not limited to) the public library,<br/>
bookstores, online e-books, sharing libraries and our church.&quot;  (Many<br/>
churches have a some sort of lending library and if you attend La Leche<br/>
League or other mom groups they usually have some sort of sharing library).<br/>
For resources, go look at your bookshelves and see what books are there that<br/>
are about science or history and write those down as resources.  If you are<br/>
in contact with a local homeschooling or unschooling group list that as a<br/>
resource.  List any books you have read on homeschooling.  And state that<br/>
you intend to use interest led unit studies.  (Isn&#39;t that sort of what we<br/>
are doing kind of maybe in a way?)  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649377662">Hi Michelle - I need to answer the following question:<br/>
   <br/>
  &quot;Describe the skills or topics to be covered in....&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  Language Arts; Math; Citizenship, History & Government; Physical Education; Health; English, American & Other Literature; The Natural Sciences; and The Fine Arts<br/>
   <br/>
  It says &quot;Please send a detailed outline or narrative which describes the content to be provided in each area of the minimum course of study below. <br/>
   <br/>
  The most common way to address literature is to provide the titles of books which you plan on having your child read for the minimum course of study.<br/>
   <br/>
  Your eligibility for home study is based on the following conditions: That you follow the program of study as specified in your enrollment notice. We expect that what is described in the curriculum will be addressed during the school year.  Your curriculum should reflect the content you plan to cover during your home study enrollment year.<br/>

move to Vermont!  I would really try to find some Vermont unschoolers to<br/>
help you word things.  I did notice that they said, &quot;The most common way to<br/>
address...&quot; Which does not say &quot;the way you should address....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I found this link:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/networking/groups/vermont.shtml">http://www.unschooling.com/networking/groups/vermont.shtml</a><br/>
<br/>
So maybe the contact person on this page could help you some?  I would still<br/>
try to be as vague as you possibly can and speak in &quot;unit study-ese&quot; to<br/>
gloss over as much as you can without being specific.<br/>
