<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kind of a double standard. You get to freely choose the things you  <br/>
think are unhealthy.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re doing is creating a mystique about coffee (as people  <br/>
often do about alcohol). It becomes not just a drink made with coffee  <br/>
beans but a rite of passage to adulthood, into being able to make  <br/>
your own choices without someone else watching and judging your choices.<br/>
<br/>
I bet if you offered her a taste she wouldn&#39;t like it and that would  <br/>
be the end of that. (Some kids, of course, do like coffee, but not  <br/>
usually. And the parents of those kids can chime in and relay what  <br/>
really happens when kids drink coffee.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She doesn&#39;t eat cookies except<br/>
&gt; for Earth&#39;s Best, her idea of candy is carob chips and ice cream is  <br/>
&gt; frozen<br/>
&gt; pureed bananas and other fruit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s nothing wrong with filling our houses with the foods we enjoy  <br/>
sharing.<br/>
<br/>
Right now life is simple with one young child. I did the same when my  <br/>
daughter was 2.5. She wasn&#39;t even sure what to do with a lollipop.<br/>
<br/>
But that comforting bubble bursts when they get older and realize  <br/>
there are foods that sound interesting that they&#39;d like to try. Or  <br/>
things they try other places that they&#39;d like you to buy.<br/>
<br/>
The problems come when we demonize food and make children feel bad  <br/>
for wanting and liking things we have decided we don&#39;t want to put  <br/>
into our own bodies. Making a child feel bad about wanting an Oreo  <br/>
will cause way more damage than an Oreo eaten in joy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes we go up to a week at a time with<br/>
&gt; her not even asking to watch TV.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How would it sound if you heard a parent say &quot;we go up to a week at a  <br/>
time with her not even asking to read a book&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
TV is not a demon. 2.5  yos often don&#39;t watch much if it isn&#39;t on.  <br/>
(At 3 though, it seems not uncommon to want to watch the same video  <br/>
or movie or set of shows over and over and over. It&#39;s a stage of  <br/>
development that does pass.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We even have a scheduled bedtime routine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Helping kids wind down and get ready for sleep with a routine helps  <br/>
them a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Setting 8PM (or whatever) as bedtime because you think that&#39;s the  <br/>
time they need to go to bed to get enough sleep is interfering with  <br/>
them learning how to listen to and respond to the needs of their  <br/>
bodies. They learn to look at the clock to determine if they&#39;re  <br/>
sleepy or not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We found it worked for us, b/c dd would get really cranky if she  <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t go<br/>
&gt; to bed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which means if you read a really good book you can&#39;t put down and  <br/>
you&#39;re up to the wee hours and find yourself grumpy the next day,  <br/>
that it&#39;s okay for your husband to forbid you to read in bed because  <br/>
it will work for &quot;us&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We can *help* kids. We can say &quot;I noticed you&#39;re grumpy today. It&#39;s  <br/>
probably because you didn&#39;t get a lot of sleep,&quot; as some information  <br/>
so they can see the connection. That *doesn&#39;t* mean they therefore  <br/>
should make the &quot;right&quot; choice next time. It means everything we  <br/>
choose has consequences. Sometimes<br/>
putting up with the consequences is worth it for a while as something  <br/>
new gets explore. We *can* tell them when they&#39;re tiredness is  <br/>
overwhelming to speak calmly so we can help them.<br/>
<br/>
We can trust them that they will learn from experience. We can be  <br/>
their partners in helping them. We can trust that sometimes the  <br/>
negative consequences are worth it to explore something. (And no,  <br/>
freedom to explore doesn&#39;t mean kids will need to explore drugs and  <br/>
alcohol and sex.)<br/>
<br/>
And if a child *wants* to stay up we can help them learn to weigh the  <br/>
pros against the cons. Sometimes the next day&#39;s tiredness will be  <br/>
worth it. If we help them learn strategies to deal with the  <br/>
grumpiness then they won&#39;t spread it around.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has no illusions about staying up late. She *has* stayed  <br/>
up all night when she was 9 or 10ish. The fun of it has worn off.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s way better for them to explore things and learn about what their  <br/>
bodies need when the worst consequence is feeling cranky than wait  <br/>
until their teens and the consequences of exploring their personal  <br/>
limits can be permanent or deadly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m sure as our children get older we will both allow our children  <br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; freedom in their choices when it comes to food, bed, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are people here who have done both: controlled their first  <br/>
children and given freedom to their later children. They can give you  <br/>
a better idea of what the differences are between controlling them  <br/>
until the parent thinks they&#39;re ready and being their partner,  <br/>
trusting them to learn, helping them explore the world from the very   <br/>
beginning.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; really happens when kids drink coffee.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of my favorite childhood memories was of sipping coffee from<br/>
Grandpas coffee cup.  :-)  I love coffee today but it wasn&#39;t due to<br/>
grandpa&#39;s influences because it was black coffee (YUK). My morning<br/>
coffee addiction started after I joined the military and then it was<br/>
not until after my first year.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what really happens?  Well, every now and then my 8yo dd (this<br/>
started 4-5 years ago) and I will have mom/daughter afternoon<br/>
coffee/chat at the table while playing Yahtzee or Sorry.  My son never<br/>
really liked it, so he rarely asks.  It also depends on which kind of<br/>
coffee being offered.  Brooke likes hers sweet so generally I poor<br/>
HALF a cup of java, a spoonful of sugar or two and fill the rest with<br/>
half -n- half.  I buy those $1 packs of flavored coffee now and then<br/>
and we quickly discover that some are just nasty which is fun because<br/>
our disgusted facial expressions are sure to follow.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the question should be...what doesn&#39;t happen if you never let<br/>
them try?  :-)  Seriously, you don&#39;t have to do a full cup of coffee,<br/>
add more milk or half and half...they only care that they are doing<br/>
what Mom/dad is doing, not about how many parts of coffee are in the<br/>
cup.  If caffeine is the concern perhaps one could offer decaf?<br/>

cream and sugar. When Karl was 2 or so he went through a good couple of<br/>
years where if anyone left coffee sitting around, he would finish it. At<br/>
that time of our lives, we often have visitors and over-night guests so it<br/>
wasn&#39;t unusual for there to be 3 or 4 half finished cups sitting around. Not<br/>
only did he survive the coffee, he survived all those germs, too!  And now,<br/>
he doesn&#39;t particularly like coffee.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another Karl story. Last night we had a large gathering of teens for a<br/>
Capture the Flag party. About 20 kids gathered and went to the nearby woods<br/>
for some Capture the Flag games. Then they all game back here for food and<br/>
hanging out. Some were in the living room listening to music, some were out<br/>
back on the patio around the fire-pit. Lots of fun. People starting leaving<br/>
around 10:00 and at 11:00 I made my rounds to those were left to say good<br/>
night and to remind my kids we had an early morning. I couldn&#39;t find Karl.<br/>
Finally someone said they thought he went to bed. My almost 15 year son was<br/>
exhausted and even with people over, decided to go to bed. By the time I<br/>
noticed, he was sound asleep. He had eaten and sat around the fire for a<br/>
while but when he was tired, he went to bed. They don&#39;t need to be made to<br/>
go to bed to figure this out.<br/>

cream and sugar so I suppose I liked it because it was sweet.   My first<br/>
memory of coffee drinking is from when I was eight or nine.  It&#39;s<br/>
possible I&#39;ve been drinking coffee for forty years.   Every other week<br/>
there&#39;s some report contradicting the last report about coffee being<br/>
healthy or unhealthy.  I think stress over what&#39;s healthy or unhealthy is<br/>
more unhealthy than coffee. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My friend and I each have colds.  She&#39;s popping Cold Snap and juicing and<br/>
fasting and all manner of other healthy ritual and feels terrible,<br/>
thinking about seeing a doctor.   I have some nice hot coffee in the<br/>
morning and feel ok without the herbs and ritual.   I know that&#39;s<br/>
anecdotal but my point is a calm and fear free life even if it includes<br/>
things considered to be unhealthy contributes to health more than worry. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Your little girl probably doesn&#39;t care about coffee at all.  Over time<br/>
you might make her care if it turns out she feels like she&#39;s missing<br/>
something. <br/>

she was very clever.  Never mind there&#39;s probably more sugar in Kool-aid<br/>
than in soda pop, I think her issue was caffeine.<br/>
<br/>
Her kids spent the night with friends and discovered real soda pop.  The<br/>
earth didn&#39;t stop and they didn&#39;t drop over dead but they did learn their<br/>
mother is a liar.   They don&#39;t trust her and that has proven to be more<br/>
unhealthy in their young lives than if they&#39;d had a can of Coke every day<br/>
for seven years.    <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with carob chips (if you like them, I&#39;d rather eat<br/>
wax) or pureed frozen fruit (which I love) but I wouldn&#39;t call it candy<br/>
and ice cream.  Those things are different and someday she&#39;ll know the<br/>
difference and it will be too late to undo your lie. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That reminds me of my first taste of coffee.  I thought my mom had a <br/>
cup of tea, and I took a sip -- UGH!  But I still don&#39;t like it - and <br/>
most people (though not all) say they learned to drink it in college <br/>
or whatnot.  I tried all types, even the chocolate coffees(figured if <br/>
I would like one, it would be that) and nope.  I finally realized <br/>
that it makes no sense to try to develop a taste for something that <br/>
is bad for me -- I like too many things that aren&#39;t good for me as is!<br/>

I hate the stuff too.<br/>

But exactly HOW is it bad for you?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s just a way to keep kids&#39; hands off something that used to <br/>
be scarce and expensive.<br/>

to migraines.  And if you are hooked on it, and try to stop -- caffeine <br/>
withdrawl can cause some awful headaches -- as I learned from my sil.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t drink beer, for the same reason.  Yuck! <br/>

(As for coffee -- I just tell people I&#39;m not grown up enough to drink <br/>
it!  I may never be grown up!)<br/>

Except that a friend of mine who suffers from migraines *uses* caffiene <br/>
to ease/ward off an oncoming migraine.<br/>
<br/>
So which *is* it????<br/>

See, not enough info--or too much!?<br/>

Because you have migraines? Or because you were hooked on it? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

I&#39;m certainly &quot;grown up&quot; enough to drink anything I want. I just choose <br/>
to stay far away from coffee.<br/>
