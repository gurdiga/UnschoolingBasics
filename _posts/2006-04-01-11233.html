<div id="ygrps-yiv-965949189">So I&#39;m working on the whole gentle-parenting thing.  Admittedly it&#39;s frustrating for me because I&#39;m working full time right now, and will be for another week or so (temp), and hubby and I don&#39;t see eye-to-eye on this issue at all.  And also because two of my kids are in school so that I can work (bummer).<br/>
<br/>
Alas....here is my question for a specific example:  We have one computer that 5 of us share.  (dh has his own, me and the kids share mine).  I&#39;ve been letting them all use the computer as much as they&#39;d like, but they will have to take turns.  It&#39;s not working out too well.  There&#39;s too much &quot;he was on longer&quot; and &quot;I didn&#39;t get a chance today&quot;.  So I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m going to have to get a timer???  I don&#39;t see any other solution to this.  And my 3 yo doesn&#39;t understand that he has to wait his turn, and gets frustrated whenever I say &quot;yes, you can play on the computer after fill-in-the-blank has their turn.  I know he doesn&#39;t understand the concept of &quot;later&quot; yet, and it sounds like &quot;no&quot; to him.  Is there something else I can say instead?<br/>
<br/>
And no, they cannot use dh&#39;s computer.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m open to suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
PS - we have the same problem with the television as well.  You know &quot;I don&#39;t want to watch that!&quot; etc , etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about, &quot;Why don&#39;t you watch your brother/sister play on the computer<br/>
until they are finished.  Then  you can have a turn.&quot;  You can also make<br/>
&quot;bargains&quot; with your older kids that they can stay up after the little ones<br/>
go to bed to get more time in.  We did that for a long time when we had one<br/>
computer.  Also is there anyway that your dh could allow your oldest child<br/>
to have access to his computer?  They could have an agreement like no<br/>
downloads and only certain websites on his computer?  We are fortunate to<br/>
currently have 3 working computers.  Another option is to find an<br/>
alternative activity for whomever it is that is feeling momentarily<br/>
computerless.  For instance a movie they have wanted to see, helping you<br/>
with something, a video game or some other something that is a &quot;hot<br/>
commodity&quot; but only available one at a time.  It doesn&#39;t always pacify the<br/>
need, but can sometimes help ease things over.<br/>
<br/>
Also, how much time would your 3yo spend in the computer once on it?  You<br/>
might ask whoever is currently on the computer if the 3yo could be on it.<br/>
Talk to them about this ahead of time.  I remember when my son was that age<br/>
he would beg to be on the computer (this is when we also had just one).  But<br/>
he would be on it for no more than an hour if that (usually 15 minutes).  It<br/>
was that &quot;right to be on it&quot; thing more than really wanting to be on it.  We<br/>
learned very quickly that if we just let him on it he would be done<br/>
relatively soon and then someone else could use the computer.<br/>
<br/>
And no, they cannot use dh&#39;s computer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ooops didn&#39;t see this.  Does he have a reason why they can&#39;t?  My co-parent<br/>
has a computer that is his &quot;work computer.&quot;  It has stuff on it that would<br/>
be detrimental to his company if it got messed up.  He has that part of the<br/>
computer password protected.  And there are certain restrictions on his<br/>
computer such as no downloading of programs, only going to certain websites<br/>
that we know are safe from viruses and spyware, saving any word documents to<br/>
a disk or e-mailing them to ourselves so we can open them on another<br/>
computer.  He only uses it when he works from home so it just sits here most<br/>
of the time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m open to suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You could always start a computer fund jar.  Donations gladly accepted to<br/>
purchase a second family computer.  I&#39;ve noticed as my kids get older their<br/>
computer time has also gotten longer.  It&#39;s how they keep in contact with<br/>
their friends, play games, keep up with the latest music, write in their<br/>
blogs or fanfiction websites, etc.  I also found that the older they get the<br/>
less games they play and the more interaction they want with people on the<br/>
other end.  My kids wanted a Play Station.  Actually Emily wanted a Play<br/>
Station, but we never seemed to have that much chunk of spare change left<br/>
each month, so she started saving to buy one.  It was something that was<br/>
important to her and she worked to get it by doing odd jobs, saving any<br/>
&quot;allowance&quot; (although it is far from the traditionall &quot;allowance&quot;) and<br/>
jumping on every penny, quarter and nickel she found on the street.  Now she<br/>
is wanting a video camera.<br/>
<br/>
PS - we have the same problem with the television as well.  You know &quot;I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; don&#39;t want to watch that!&quot; etc , etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Three letters - DVR (or one word Tivo!)  We didn&#39;t get a DVR for the longest<br/>
time because we thought it would be so much more expensive.  We found out it<br/>
was only an extra $6 a month.  $6 I will gladly pay to appease the need to<br/>
see a certain show!  If you still have a VCR (so few do now) you could<br/>
always teach your kids how to record the shows they want to see.<br/>
