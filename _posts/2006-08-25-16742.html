We just went thru this. Our oldest (still at home) wants to go into the army. The recruiter said the Army&#39;s requirement is ....... a high school diploma.  And yes, you the parent can issue the diploma.  We asked him if ds would be better with a GED and they said no, a parent issued diploma along with a very basic transcript is perfectly fine.  I don&#39;t know about the other branches but this is what the Army says.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All the military academies accept homeschool &quot;graduates&quot; with a parent<br/>
issued diploma.  They are more concerned with the other requirements<br/>
that they require of all their cadets than with a piece of paper.<br/>
Primarily foreign language study, community service, mathematics, etc.<br/>
 This can all be easily documented it a child has that desire.  And<br/>
there are cadets that are not your typical 18yo &quot;kids.&quot;  There are<br/>
people all through their 20&#39;s that have decided to enter the<br/>
academies, so if your child decides at 18 or 19 that they would want<br/>
to be an officer in the military and attend a military academy they<br/>
still have plenty of time to meet those requirements.<br/>
<br/>
People get focused on the age of 18, like everything has to be<br/>
complete by that age.  There are no deadlines in life when it comes to<br/>
learning.  If a child has a goal, be it college, the military, owning<br/>
their own business, hiking through Europe I think it is our<br/>
responsiblity to help that child meet that goal.  It is not our<br/>
responsibility to load our children up with everything &quot;just in case&quot;<br/>
they want to follow a certain career goal.  That&#39;s what schools do.<br/>
They have 100&#39;s (sometimes 1,000&#39;s) of children with all varying goals<br/>
in mind so they have to teach everything to everyone so that each<br/>
child has access to everyting &quot;just in case.&quot;  That&#39;s not an<br/>
unschooling philosophy.  With unschooling we help our children learn<br/>
their passions and help open doors for them that will get them to<br/>
their goals.<br/>

enlisted. If I remember correctly from the last time I looked this <br/>

school diploma you are enlisted slightly higher ranking than someone <br/>
with a GED (I don&#39;t know all the terminology but you&#39;d be a recruit <br/>
class 1 instead of a recruit class 2 or whatever). They won&#39;t turn <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually what rank you enter the military (enlistment wise) has more<br/>
to do with what rate you choose and your commitment is rather than<br/>
your background.  For instance my co-parent inlisted at an E-3 because<br/>
he chose to fulfill his military obligation of 6 (it is now 8) years<br/>
active duty and because he was in a more advanced rate (electronics).<br/>
Those that chose to fulfill their military obligation for only partial<br/>
time (serving the remainder in the reserves) and/or choose lower rates<br/>
(I&#39;m guessing cook and bottle washer type fields) would enter at lower<br/>
ranks.  Also how quickly you make it through your schools also will<br/>
determine how quickly you move up the ladder.  Someone who applies<br/>
him/herself will move up quicker than someone who does it more slowly.<br/>
 Many of the initial schools are self paced and you can test through<br/>
them quite quickly.  Dan actually was limited by how quickly he could<br/>
get through because they could only take so many tests a day.<br/>
<br/>
Again, we are talking about &quot;planning for something that isn&#39;t a sure<br/>
thing.&quot;  It&#39;s a fear thing.  &quot;What if my child wants.....?  What if my<br/>
child isn&#39;t able to ......?&quot;  What if your child doesn&#39;t want.......?<br/>
:)  As I said if it is something that a child wants to do and is<br/>
concerned about what level s/he enters the military in then that is<br/>
when we step in and help that child achieve the goal they have set for<br/>
themselves.  And (for many of our children) we are talking about<br/>
something that is 10 or more years away.  The acceptance of<br/>
homeschoolers just a dozen years ago in the military and colleges was<br/>
much different than it is today.  I would presume that in another<br/>
dozen years there will be a whole new (and more progressive) outlook<br/>
towards homeschooled children entering higher education, the military<br/>
and direct to the workforce.  Homeschooling is growing at an<br/>
exceedingly fast rate due to parents becoming exceedingly disastisfied<br/>
with how schools are approaching learning and the treatment of<br/>
children.  that is going to force changes in the way that future<br/>
employers, recruiters and universities view home educated children.<br/>

that they will accept a parent-issued diploma.  My son doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
have to go in as a GED recruit for the very reason stated above.  It <br/>
does seem silly, but it is the system none-the-less.<br/>

For us this is right around the corner so to speak.  Andrew has been <br/>
in public school his whole life.  He struggled and persevered in the <br/>
system.  He just came home this past April.  So it is VERY important <br/>
that I pay attention to his needs and desires.  He will be 15 in a <br/>
matter of weeks.  His desire *is* to enlist in the military as a <br/>
career choice at the earliest age possible.  He wants to retire <br/>
out.  This is not something he takes lightly and is very serious <br/>
about his decision.  It is not to say that he may not change his <br/>
mind, but since it has been a calling on his heart for over 10 years <br/>
the last thing I want is my neglegence to hinder his dream.<br/>
<br/>
The information everyone has provided has been extremely helpful and <br/>
encouraging.  We actually waited to pull him out of school until we <br/>
knew for sure that he could still go into the service.  Although, it <br/>
has been a concern of Andrew&#39;s to this day.  This discussion will <br/>
help me reassure him that we are indeed on the right track.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;d also want to check with which particular branch of service he <br/>
wants to be in - while they are generally similar (minimum age is <br/>
usually the same for example), each branch does have some leeway in <br/>
how they view certain things (like a GED vs diploma).<br/>
<br/>
For example, straight from a Marine Corps website (a section for <br/>
parents to help their kids wanting to enlist in the Corps):<br/>
&quot;Question:  Does one need a high-school diploma to enlist? <br/>
Answer:  Yes, but on occasion there are openings for those with <br/>
alternative high school credentials.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s already 15, and really set on this, go ahead and start <br/>
checking with recruiters. They can help provide info on things like <br/>
physical conditioning (he should already be working on daily, running, <br/>
etc to get ready for the physical part of basic training), taking the <br/>
ASVAB test (when, where, how much, how to prepare, etc), and things <br/>
like that.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks, Deb...we have been discussing just those issues.  <br/>
Fortunately, he is very active.  We are getting ready to sign him up <br/>
for a class locally that encompases Tae Kwon Do, Tang Soo Do, and <br/>
Hap Ki Do.  He searched it out on his own.  I just spoke with one of <br/>
the teachers there and it sounds like a great program.  It&#39;s kind of <br/>
like attending a private school for martial arts.  <br/>
<br/>
We are also looking into a program through the Coast Guard where he <br/>
would go stay with them for a few days and participate in their <br/>
daily routine.  Sounds way cool!  Tomorrow we are going to an event <br/>
called Coast Guard Days that sounds really interesting as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now he is undetermined as to the branch, so we are trying to <br/>
expose him to as much as possible.  We have a friend that has a son <br/>
in the service and we happen to live near the local military base.  <br/>
He has offered to take him there and give him a tour.  Awesome!<br/>
<br/>
We are definately putting a trip to the local recruiting office on <br/>
our list of things to do very soon.  I never thought I&#39;d be <br/>
encouraging (assisting) one of my children in pursuing a military <br/>
career.  You never know where life will lead when you are following <br/>
your children.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-368004281">Well, my hubby is finally home from work, and wouldn&#39;t you know it, he forgot to ask about recruiting requirements for homeschoolers. I did find out a little more regarding the GED and ranks. He said the army treats diplomas and GEDs the same, but he thinks the army is the only branch that will accept a GED. Regarding rank, there are several ways for an army recruit to start out higher than an E-1 (lowest rank). The more college credits you have, the higher the rank you can start at. JROTC or Civil Air Patrol experience (not sure if these are available outside of public schools or not), being an Eagle Scout, or participating in the army&#39;s &quot;new recruit&quot; program are other ways to advance in rank before actually leaving for training. <br/>
 <br/>
Tina, if you need any more info regarding the army, please feel free to email me anytime. My husband has no problems answering any questions that may come up and since he&#39;s still a new recruiter, he&#39;ll learn a few things himself.  :-)<br/>
