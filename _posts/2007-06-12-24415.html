<div id="ygrps-yiv-799713346">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
Issue 7 of *Connections: ezine of unschooling and mindful parenting* is <br/>
now available online. To check out a sample issue, the front cover, or <br/>

<br/>
In this issue I&#39;m pleased to welcome Schuyler Waynforth to our list of <br/>
regular writers and to present Laurie Chancey&#39;s debut column, <br/>
&quot;Unprocessed,&quot; where she talks about growing up as an always unschooled <br/>
child. We&#39;ve also introduced a new segment by Ren Allen--&quot;I-Tribe&quot;--in <br/>
which she offers creative inspiration and challenges as a spin-off of <br/>
her yahoo group, Imagination Tribe.<br/>
<br/>
Articles in this issue discuss topics like the benefits of late reading, <br/>
the joys of learning without school, the importance of family stories, <br/>
and even how one unschooling mom helps her child pursue learning and <br/>
autonomy despite the law. Our feature author this month along with <br/>
Laurie Chancey is Sarah Briand, who treats readers to an insightful and <br/>
inspiring look at unschooling transformation and process in her article, <br/>
&quot;The Dragonfly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With a heavy heart I&#39;m also announcing today that we&#39;ll be saying <br/>
goodbye this issue to Anne Ohman, whose column &quot;Oh How We Shine!&quot; has <br/>
been inspirational to so many of us over the past year. Anne will be <br/>
leaving us to walk forward in the direction of new opportunities and <br/>
adventures, and we wish her the best of luck.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
