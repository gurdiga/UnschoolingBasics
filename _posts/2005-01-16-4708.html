<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215858567">I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve even introduced myself here or not; I&#39;ll save that<br/>
for another post because this one may be long enough as it is.  I need<br/>
some brainstorming help, and since this is a &quot;beginners&quot; list I figured<br/>
I could ask here.  Although not new to the concept of unschooling, I<br/>
haven&#39;t actually done it yet.  I&#39;ve wanted to for a few years now but<br/>
have been teaching full time at a private school in order for my oldest<br/>
to be able to continue attending there (our public schools are horrible<br/>
and he emphatically did *not* want to homeschool).  My middle son has<br/>
wanted to hs, but has gone along with whatever everyone else was doing.<br/>
My youngest was very interested in starting kindergarten in school this<br/>
year.  Next year my oldest will be graduating from this school and going<br/>
to high school.  We are financially in a different place, and I have a<br/>
perfect job as an internet charter school teacher already lined up for<br/>
next year.  We just bought a new house that we will be moving in to next<br/>
month so that we will have enough room to actually enjoy being home.<br/>
Everything looked like it will fall into place perfectly.<br/>
Now there&#39;s a problem.  My middle son (9 y.o., 4th grade) is unhappy at<br/>
school this year.  His best friend is playing some game with another kid<br/>
all the time that my son doesn&#39;t enjoy.  He does enjoy playing soccer<br/>
and football with the other boys, but they never pass him the ball (his<br/>
friend told him it&#39;s because they think he&#39;s no good).  He is not an<br/>
athlete, definitely, but he is in tae kwon do, and is doing very well in<br/>
that.  Another boy, who he was good buddies with, is now picking on him.<br/>
First he was poking him in the belly and saying, &quot;Big belly&quot;.  I talked<br/>
to the teacher, and she said that the problem seemed to have resolved<br/>
itself.  Then he was pinching him every time they were in line.  I found<br/>
out about this during Christmas break, but it never resumed when school<br/>
started back (I was ready to make a stink).  This weekend my son told me<br/>
that every time he goes near this boy, the boy starts talking loudly to<br/>
whoever he is with about how &quot;stupid and annoying&quot; my son is.  My son<br/>
wants me to do something so the kid will stop (and get in trouble) and<br/>
is dying to get out of school.  I want to ring the kid&#39;s neck and take<br/>
down his mother (she is also a teacher at my school; she also has<br/>
attitude problems, even with her employer).  Obviously not the best<br/>
solution.<br/>
Besides all this, my son is becoming less and less enamored with<br/>
learning as we speak.  He had always fared pretty well and was pretty<br/>
resilient.  We&#39;ve never been pushy about grades or anything.  He&#39;s<br/>
starting to really actually hate school work now.  <br/>
I&#39;m so sick about this right now.  What to do:<br/>
 <br/>
 - my husband suggested switching classes for the rest of the year;<br/>
however, the problem is at recess time, and the two classes are together<br/>
then<br/>
 <br/>
 - if I quit to bring him home, I will not be able to afford my 8th<br/>
grader graduating with his class.  We will not be able to afford our new<br/>
house.  My husband would be very unsupportive of this idea (and he just<br/>
recently became finally supportive of homeschooling).<br/>
 <br/>
 - if I keep him in, and talk to the teacher, administrator, other<br/>
parent, whatever it takes to make it stop... I don&#39;t know if it will<br/>
actually stop.  Maybe the name calling will.  But he is still being not<br/>
included by other boys.  There are 4 boys in the 4th grade that he says<br/>
are nice, so he is not without any friends.<br/>
 <br/>
 - I&#39;ve thought about trying to get admin approval to have him with me<br/>
during the day (I teach jr. high).  He would be able to read, use the<br/>
computers, help in the computer lab (which the teacher would love and he<br/>
is more than capable of), play his gameboy, etc.  Negatives - not much<br/>
physical activity time, may get boring for him after awhile, and I don&#39;t<br/>
think the administrators would go for it.  Although I am well-respected<br/>
and appreciated, and usually get my way, this seems like something they<br/>
would perceive as not looking good for the school, and therefore not<br/>
workable.  I don&#39;t want to pull an ultimatum at this point (I would have<br/>
a few weeks ago before we bought a new freaking house).<br/>
 <br/>
- I can&#39;t think of anyone who could watch him during the day.  Although<br/>
both grandparents are semi-nearby, they wouldn&#39;t be willing to watch him<br/>
every day, and it would add 30 - 40 minutes to our commute to and from<br/>
school each day.  Even if there was an unschooling family nearby, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t leave him with them, because I don&#39;t know them.<br/>
 <br/>
Is there anything I haven&#39;t thought of?  Has anybody had a similar<br/>
dilemma?  What would you do?  <br/>
 <br/>
If you read this far, thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353172395">Hi Q <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t have any big idea for you.  Reading about your son reminded me  soo <br/>
much of my own son.  He had increasing problems as he got further up in  elem <br/>
school.  He was bullied to a point where it was a problem starting in  4th <br/>
grade.  His fourth grade teacher was a first year teacher or I think it  would <br/>
have been much worse that year.  But she was still young and  idealistic, and she <br/>
protected him alot.  But the next year he had a  teacher who seemed to <br/>
indentify more with popular kids and kids who wore the  latest fashion than she did <br/>
with the rest of the class.  I swear she seemed  to flirt all the time.  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, the best thing in the WORLD that we have ever done for him is to  <br/>
take him out of school and let him become his own person.  There is a  social <br/>
system in school that in itself should be the answer to the  &quot;socialization <br/>
question&quot;  that every one asks when they hear that your  children don&#39;t go to <br/>
school.  There is a ranking of individuals that  doesn&#39;t play out in the adult <br/>
world and many young children are targeted for  ridicule by people who don&#39;t even <br/>
know them.  At a very young and  impressionable age.<br/>
 <br/>
We have unschooled for the last year (almost- end of January).  I have  seen <br/>
my son interact with people of all ages and stages of life.  He is  caring and <br/>
considerate, he has a good sense of humor,  and he has made  friends with <br/>
people throughout our community.  I used to feel a physical  ache in my chest <br/>
when my son went to school.  Now I have a happy, healthy,  well adjusted 12 year <br/>
old son, who talks to me and tells me things.  <br/>
 <br/>
I swear that I can&#39;t imagine having to go through all the &quot;teen angst&quot; you  <br/>
hear so much about.  Maybe I&#39;m blind and can&#39;t see it coming.  Maybe  some <br/>
lifelong unschoolers will contradict me and tell me that it is a normal  stage and <br/>
I need to be on the look out.  But right now it seems so far out  of the <br/>
realm of the possible.<br/>
 <br/>
I work 12 hour night shifts in a hospital.  And I know that you don&#39;t  have <br/>
that option as a teacher,  but I hope you can figure out a solution  because I <br/>
can identify with your situation and unschooling has made my life and  my sons <br/>
life, hey, my whole family&#39;s life, 100% better.  :-)<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck and keep reading,  these people have great ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608532247">I don&#39;t see that there is any perfect fix.  When my daughter was miserable in school (she was always &quot;below grade level&quot; as they would say and bullied because of her size), we took her out.  It wasn&#39;t a hard decision, because her needs come first.  I can&#39;t really related to buying the new home, because we have purposely always lived in a very modest home...one that hubby could afford on his salary.  I guess I think you might just need to take a serious look at your wants (new house) and your income and find a way to make it work.  It won&#39;t be easy in the beginning, but I think it will be worth it in the long run.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425268761">Thanks to everyone who has responded.  I really appreciate it!  I did<br/>
want to clarify a couple things.  We have been planning and preparing<br/>
for me to be able to homeschool after this year.  We can afford<br/>
everything we need to afford (including the house) without me teaching<br/>
at this private school (which pays peanuts anyway).  But, for the next<br/>
couple months while we are moving, preparing the old house to rent,<br/>
paying for inspections, etc., we actually do need the extra peanuts, not<br/>
to mention the teachers 93% tuition discount to keep the other two in<br/>
school where they want to be.  At this point we could not pull out of<br/>
escrow without losing thousands.  <br/>
I realize it sounded like I was trying to decide between our house and<br/>
our son, but that is SO not it in our family.  It just was phenomenally<br/>
bad timing the way everything happened.  A couple months ago I could<br/>
have quit no problem.  In a couple months I could quit no problem.  It&#39;s<br/>
just THESE couple months that are very difficult.  We are so not the<br/>
people with two car payments, huge house payments, hair and nail appts,<br/>
golf memberships, etc. who &quot;can&#39;t afford&quot; to have one income.<br/>
My son&#39;s well being is obviously my priority, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
trying to solve this problem.  I am going to talk with the teachers and<br/>
administrators tomorrow.  Thanks again for giving your input Ren,<br/>
Cheryl, Brandie, and Deirdre.<br/>

two homeschooling families or even someone doing home daycare who&#39;d <br/>

better for him!<br/>
<br/>
I do understand your concern about leaving him with strangers, <br/>
certainly. But I think it might be worth exploring, esp. if it&#39;s a <br/>
family that has watched other kids and therefore has references.<br/>
