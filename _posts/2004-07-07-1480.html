<div id="ygrps-yiv-418462798">***Instead of saying, &quot;wow, what a loser&quot;, how about a deep breath and a<br/>
silent<br/>
wish for them to find peace for themselves and their children?***<br/>
<br/>
This is kind of rambling and long but I think there might be a point in<br/>
here somewhere.  Not technically an unschooling issue if you describe<br/>
unschooling as not doing school, but an unschooling issue if you describe<br/>
unschooling as a life philosophy.    A human rights issue, I guess.  <br/>
<br/>
My sister in law is here with her kids.  We were all up at my mom in<br/>
law&#39;s house, cooking, eating, visiting and I started to do the dishes.  <br/>
Dylan went out to the picnic table to collect plates and glasses people<br/>
were finished with.<br/>
<br/>
My sil came in and said to her middle daughter &quot;you&#39;re just sitting there<br/>
letting her do the dishes?&quot; in a tone that was so snotty and<br/>
disrespectful.  Lillie said she thought we&#39;d probably talked about it and<br/>
already worked it out and her mom said &quot;No adult in this house should<br/>
have to do dishes when there are three teen aged girls here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My stomach hurt.  Dylan was SO offended he got up and went outside.  I<br/>
told Lillie I was sorry my actions resulted in her being yelled at and<br/>
told her I was happy to do the dishes, that I liked the hot water and it<br/>
made my hands feel good.   I told my sil if she was being harsh on her<br/>
kids to impress me it was failing miserably and I&#39;d rather see everyone<br/>
happy even if I ended up doing every dish from now until eternity.<br/>
<br/>
When people talk like that to their kids it&#39;s not parenting.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know quite what to call it, but if we keep calling the abuse of kids by<br/>
their parents &quot;parenting&quot; we&#39;re not going to get anywhere. <br/>
<br/>
If my sister in law had been talking to/about the neighbor kids who<br/>
happen to be black and had said &quot;No white person in this house should<br/>
have to do dishes when there are three black girls here&quot;   Everyone would<br/>
have exploded in outrage.   If a man had said &quot;No man in this house<br/>
should have to do dishes when there are women here.&quot;  I can&#39;t think of<br/>
anyone who&#39;d stay silent.   Really, I&#39;m asking now, is there anyone on<br/>
this list who wouldn&#39;t have made a judgement about that kind of behavior?<br/>
 Would we spend a minute debating whether it was right to judge? <br/>
<br/>
Our society lets this kind of discrimination, disrespect, abuse of kids<br/>
go on and on because we tell ourselves we shouldn&#39;t be judgmental about<br/>
the way others parent.  <br/>
<br/>
Bullshit.   <br/>
<br/>
People like this are hurting their kids as surely as if they were hitting<br/>
them.  Sickeningly enough, even if she&#39;d hit her daughter then (she does,<br/>
but she didn&#39;t then) no one in the family (except Dylan and I ) would<br/>
have said anything about it. <br/>
<br/>
We seem to still be pretty comfortable letting adults get away with<br/>
discrimination against children and I wonder why.   How many of us on<br/>
this list could witness a woman being abusive to her elderly mother and<br/>
not make a judgement call about whether it&#39;s right or wrong?   How many<br/>
of us could watch a man treat his wife this way and not make a judgement<br/>
about it? <br/>
<br/>
I think the only way things will start to change for children on a larger<br/>
scale than just our little unschooling lists, is if we are brave enough<br/>
to speak up in defense of kids who are being treated like crap by their<br/>
parents.  Maybe even if we do we won&#39;t be able to make much difference, I<br/>
don&#39;t know, but I know I don&#39;t want to look into my son&#39;s eyes and tell<br/>
him I was too worried about being politically correct to try.<br/>

Thanks for writing this.  My husband always says that different <br/>
people parent differently and I shouldn&#39;t judge.  But if what they <br/>
are doing is hurting their kids, maybe I should judge.  As long as <br/>
hurtful behavior is ignored it will keep going on.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;m new to unschooling and related types of parenting and I&#39;m <br/>
just begining to change the way I talk and notice how harsh everyone <br/>
else sounds! Happened today at the park. The thing is, though, I <br/>
think a lot of people think they have to choose being being &quot;strict&quot; <br/>
and being permissive. I didn&#39;t know there was another option until <br/>
recently.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of the breastfeeding issue. If a woman has never seen <br/>
someone breastfeeding, has a bunch of nieces and nephews who are <br/>
happy and healthy after formula, etc., it wouldn&#39;t suprise me if she <br/>
didn&#39;t nurse her kids or not for long. On the other hand, when <br/>
someone has plenty of exposure to b.f. and just says &quot;eww, yucky, I <br/>
don&#39;t wanna&quot; then I&#39;m more likely to have a negative impression of <br/>
her!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tough one. I want to shield kids (not just mine) from negative <br/>
comments, but I know in some cases I can either yell or keep my mouth <br/>
shut. I think it&#39;s going to be a real challenge to find things to say <br/>
and do that make a given situation better for everyone--esp. for the <br/>
usually defenseless kids.<br/>
<br/>
After seeing the teachers, the teenage camp leader types and other <br/>
parents at the park today, I don&#39;t ever want to let my kids talk to <br/>
other adults again! Yuck, yuck and yuck. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bravo Deb! We spent a miserable evening at a famiy&#39;s house last <br/>
night. We knew it was going to be miserable, but felt compelled to <br/>
go because it was a birthday celebration for a friend of Laurie&#39;s <br/>
(he lives with us) at his parents home. His mother and sil yelled at <br/>
the two boys the entire evening. Every move they made was criticized.<br/>
<br/>
One grandson is 9 and hearing and sight impaired and a few other <br/>
problems. He walked into a solid glass storm door and the <br/>
grandmother yelled, &quot;You idiot! How many times are you going to do <br/>
that?&quot; My bf said, &quot;Maybe putting some kind of sticker on the door <br/>
at eye level would help him see it.&quot; (we were ready to tackle this <br/>
woman and put duct tape on her mouth) She said, &quot;He&#39;s done it 1000 <br/>
times. I&#39;m not messing up my door with a sticker just because he&#39;s <br/>
stupid.&quot; Our mouths dropped open and I said, &quot;Why are you all so <br/>
mean to the children?&quot;  She replied, &quot;Because they&#39;re hell spawn.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The two boys were so sweet - not even rambunctious in the least. My <br/>
heart was breaking. I agree with Deb. No one would have remained <br/>
silent if that witch was talking to an adult like that. Why should <br/>
we remain silent when it&#39;s a child being abused? The kids need us to <br/>
speak out for them. They have NO power in their own homes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve said it before after visiting them (twice in seven years) that <br/>
I will NEVER go there again, but last night was the clincher. I will <br/>
NEVER go there again. <br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie</div>

&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453467863">I know Kathryn. I&#39;ve thought the same thing, but they aren&#39;t up for <br/>
it...especially since their now 27-year old son has been living with <br/>
us for 7 years and he&#39;s struggling daily with how his mom raised <br/>
him. :-(  The 27-year old designed the cover of my book and they&#39;ve <br/>
never even seen it. It makes me a little crazy.<br/>
