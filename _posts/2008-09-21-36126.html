<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850277318">So, as of March, I have been lurking, reading, educating myself about <br/>
unschooling.  I&#39;ve an 18 year old that has just left for college, and <br/>
a 17 year old...both went through the public and private school <br/>
systems.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a 4 and 2 year old that  I am unschooling.<br/>

I completely agree with what I have read in books and online about <br/>
how to raise my children, and that is what I am doing.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my question...when my 2 year old, doesn&#39;t &quot;listen to me&quot;....<br/>
(and to me that is ok)  how do I get other&#39;s (parents, and relatives)<br/>
to understand that it is ok to me that he does not &quot;listen to me&quot;?  <br/>
how can I convince them that I am not in control of him?  or her?  <br/>
that I am trying to guide not threaten or inflict?  Is this a loss <br/>
cause?  Will they see it?  is it worth even having the conflict?  <br/>
<br/>
I hear<br/>
&quot;children need to listen to their parents&quot;<br/>
&quot;children need to obey&quot;<br/>
&quot;they can not decide what they will or will not do&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I feel that if I place my child in an adult environment, and they <br/>
still act like they are 2...that is the child&#39;s right?<br/>
<br/>
I am just wondering how to explain this to my Mom, and Sister...any <br/>
quick quotes or references would also be appreciated.<br/>

thank you...i am just at a loss as to how to explain what I think is <br/>
right for my kids<br/>

 </span></blockquote>By moving to a new frame of mind, perhaps? Don&#39;t think &quot;listen to me&quot;  <br/>
even in quotes. Think helping him find better options.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how can I convince them that I am not in control of him?  or her?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t. And trying will be as effective as their attempts to  <br/>
change you! And probably rouse the same feelings of irritation.<br/>
<br/>
But just as unschoolers don&#39;t turn their kids toward a college path,  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean your actions can&#39;t influence them. Unschooled kids do go  <br/>
to college when it feels like the right path to them. But pushing  <br/>
often has the opposite effect.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that I am trying to guide not threaten or inflict?  Is this a loss<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it needs to be an either or. Live your life as you  <br/>
believe right, let them live theirs. It will help you live more  <br/>
peacefully with your life if you&#39;re not trying to change them and  <br/>
accept that they can&#39;t change you unless you let them. See their  <br/>
attempts to change you as just a need they have and let it wash over  <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
What helped me was picturing the difference in drawing power I feel  <br/>
towards the messages of 1) a fundamentalist Christian who needs to  <br/>
save my soul and 2) Mother Teresa who lived her life doing what she  <br/>
believed was right. One is actively pulling and makes me want to pull  <br/>
away and shut my ears. One isn&#39;t pulling, and yet Mother Teresa pulls  <br/>
a lot more powerfully by just being.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an atheist so it&#39;s not a religion thing :-) It is, though, the  <br/>
power of knowing you&#39;re doing what&#39;s right for you without imposing  <br/>
that on someone else. Earth Mother types have it too: the serenity of  <br/>
being at peace with and embracing your choices as being right for you.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t seen the documentary on Mother Teresa, it might help  <br/>
you get what I mean:<br/>

help him explore his options in a safe way.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see it so much as a matter of &quot;rights&quot; as of trying to <br/>
understand and meet needs - your child&#39;s and those of other adults. <br/>
Its easy for a young child to be overwhelmed in an &quot;adult <br/>
environment&quot; - or to be overwhelming! I&#39;ve consistently found that <br/>
my kids do better (in terms of *not* being overwelmed or <br/>
overwhelming) if I make an effort to be focused and present with <br/>
them rather than get all wrapped up in adult conversation. That can <br/>
be challenging if &quot;adult conversation&quot; is the reason for the visit! <br/>
You might want to find ways to get your &quot;adult time&quot; needs in other <br/>
ways. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am just wondering how to explain this to my Mom, and Sister...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you spend a lot of time with them? Maybe a simple &quot;I&#39;m trying <br/>
something different this time &#39;round. If it doesn&#39;t work I can <br/>
always go back to what I did before.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I hear<br/>

&gt; &quot;children need to obey&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this from your mom and sister? Are they used to you taking their <br/>
advice? Do they see you as &quot;going off the deep end?&quot; maybe? From <br/>
their perspective, this radical unschooling stuff probably sounds <br/>
crazy - heck, it did to me at first! If you are close to them, work <br/>
on addressing the underlying needs and issues - they are concerned <br/>
because they care about you. Let them know you value their love and <br/>
support and appreciate their concern. <br/>
<br/>
Tell them sweet stories about your happy children. Say things <br/>
like &quot;I just love how motivated he is!&quot; when he&#39;s being determined, <br/>
and &quot;Oh, he&#39;s so creative!&quot; when he&#39;s being feisty. Rather than <br/>
explaining, reframe what they see your kids doing in positive, <br/>
affirming terms. <br/>
