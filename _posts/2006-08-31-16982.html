<div id="ygrps-yiv-641590427">&quot;I believe when I am living my best life, being my best self, then<br/>
what others do will have no impact on my peace. But,if I can model<br/>
this for my children, what a gift I will give to them: an example of a<br/>
person who followed her bliss, lived the life of her dreams and died<br/>
with a smile on her face having no regrets.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

entire post...I really think you should submit it to the Blog<br/>
Carnival. Thanks for sharing that Tyra.<br/>
