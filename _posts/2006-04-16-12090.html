<div id="ygrps-yiv-360049923">&quot;On the rare occasion that we&#39;re having a<br/>
special treat, say coffee I explain to her that it&#39;s something grown-ups<br/>
drink that&#39;s not very really healthy and when she gets older she&#39;s welcome<br/>
to try it. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
If coffee is truly unhealthy, then no one should drink it. There&#39;s<br/>
nothing wrong with a little person drinking some coffee. There&#39;s<br/>
nothing wrong with them having a sip of wine either. I think that&#39;s<br/>
the best way for a toddler to learn what they like and don&#39;t<br/>
like...sipping or eating off of their families food and drink.<br/>
<br/>
If you make food an issue now, it&#39;s going to be a lot harder for her<br/>
to find a balance later. I&#39;ve been on both sides of this one....<br/>
I still would prefer we all eat mostly organic, whole grain health<br/>
foods. My kids have other ideas. I wish I had trusted them from day one.<br/>
<br/>
There is no harm in a child drinking a bit of coffee though. That&#39;s<br/>
just a big old myth.  Most kids don&#39;t care for the taste until they&#39;re<br/>
a bit older anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-940740384">&quot;I LOVE THAT BOY!  One of those heartwarming moments, again, and from<br/>
a mom who doesn&#39;t require chores. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really sweet.<br/>
<br/>
I have a dishes story from yesterday too. It&#39;s not as nice as yours.<br/>
After I got off work, the house was a TOTAL wreck (dh was distracted<br/>
by tax stuff so not as available) and I wanted to get ready for Easter<br/>
company.  I started cleaning the kitchen area and asked Sierra and<br/>
Jared to PLEASE help out because I was a bit overwhelmed. <br/>
<br/>
Sierra jumped right up, but wanted to handwash dishes. I was starting<br/>
to get agitated anyway, because Jared was sitting and watching me<br/>
clean like a madwoman and not doing a thing (those damn expectations<br/>
getting in the way again).  I explained to Sierra that I just wanted<br/>
the counters cleared and handwashing was NOT an option right at that<br/>
moment (brilliant Ren).<br/>
She was pissed off and left. If she couldn&#39;t handwash, she wasn&#39;t<br/>
going to help. Argh.<br/>
<br/>
So I got some stuff done, grumped about not getting enough help (smack<br/>
my forehead here!!) and Jared started helping. <br/>
<br/>
Funny thing about him, he truly just doesn&#39;t notice sometimes. He<br/>
wasn&#39;t trying to be unhelpful (he&#39;s a very sweet guy) he was just<br/>
thinking about other things.<br/>
<br/>
So later on, when we&#39;re trying to wind the night down, I&#39;m feeling<br/>
guilty for not letting Sierra handwash the dishes and being a general<br/>
jerk.<br/>
I cleaned up and all the dishes that didn&#39;t fit in the dishwasher got<br/>
saved for her.:)  I filled up the sink with warm, soapy water and<br/>
hollered &quot;Sierra, you want to wash dishes now?&quot;<br/>
She came running and happily stood washing the whole  pile.<br/>
<br/>
As she washed, she says &quot;Mom,I wonder why some people love to wash<br/>
dishes?&quot;  I laughed and told her the story of Dylan and Deb (also<br/>
shared it on my conference CD) and I was glad she liked helping me so<br/>
much.:)<br/>
<br/>
I felt a bit of redemption at that point and told her I was sorry for<br/>
being grumpy earlier.  I guess the whole point of this rambling story<br/>
is that help does not always come in the form we think it should. But<br/>
if we honor their efforts and embrace whatever form of help we get,<br/>
kids are totally willing to be part of our household tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe not all of them (who on earth likes ALL of them?) but that&#39;s ok.<br/>
Jalen loves helping me fold laundry...go figure.  It&#39;s still one of my<br/>
least favorite chores because my Mom was SUCH a bitch about it.<br/>
<br/>
He folds in his own unique way (as a five year old would)and loves<br/>
hauling laundry to it&#39;s home. It never looks super neat. But he&#39;s<br/>
enjoying an activity with me. Who cares if they even get folded?<br/>
They&#39;re clean and put away right?:)<br/>

I drank it when I was 2-3 years old. My grandfather would make me <br/>
&quot;coffee milk&quot;---mostly milk and sugar with a little coffee added. We&#39;d <br/>
go on the side porch to drink. He&#39;d call the bob whites to the porch, <br/>
then I&#39;d sneeze and chase them away.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t drink coffee now. Can&#39;t stand the taste or smell. Vile and <br/>
disgusting! I choose chai. My 10 year old has always liked coffee. He <br/>
has *maybe* 2-3 cups of coffee per month. He usually prefers hot <br/>
chocolate. Ben will have a cup of expresso when we go out to eat. Cam <br/>
only drinks water and herbal tea. But we all have a choice. Neither of <br/>
the boys will be running out to drink 2-3 cups of coffee in the morning <br/>
just to get going after they leave home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050667530">It&#39;s funny because that&#39;s exactly how I started to like coffee - <br/>
drinking my mom&#39;s cold leftovers :)  She had 6 kids and was always <br/>
leaving half-drunk coffee cups in every room.<br/>
