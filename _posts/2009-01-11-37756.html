<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921955314">A year ago, I bought some really cool Harry Potter chemistry kits.<br/>
They came with wands and a cauldron, and lots of other cool stuff.<br/>
They were originally sold by Scholastic Books for $12.99 (or so) a<br/>
piece. However, I found a company that sold them as a complete set<br/>
for much cheaper. Now they are going out of business due to a family<br/>
emergency and need to sell all of their stock. The Harry Potter kits<br/>
(which are new and have never been opened) are now 50% off at $10.75<br/>
for 11 kits and $18.98 for 13 kits (each kit comes in it&#39;s own<br/>
enclosed Scholastic envelope). I can&#39;t say enough about these kits.<br/>
Each one is jam packed with stuff to do and lots of extras! At their<br/>
website you can look at each kit individually to get an idea of what<br/>
they contain. The kits are no longer available, so they are not easy<br/>
to find. If you want me to bring them to our next meeting, I can do<br/>
that, so you can see.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the website:<br/>
