<br/>
Don&#39;t sign up with HSLDA.  That&#39;s my 2 cents :)  I<br/>
don&#39;t agree with them on most issues.  (See the last<br/>
link down below). Here is some more info...<br/>
<br/>
Mike Farris is the co-founder of HSLDA, Home School<br/>
Legal Defense Association. HSLDA was established in<br/>
1983 in response to an expected increase of<br/>
conservative Christians choosing to homeschool for<br/>
religious reasons. HSLDA has spawned offshoots,<br/>
including the National Center for Home Education<br/>
(NCHE) and Patrick Henry College.<br/>
 <br/>
HSLDA is a Christian organization. <br/>
<br/>
You can find the HSLDA web site at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hslda.org">http://hslda.org</a><br/>
<br/>
And for a opposing viewpoint about HSLDA, you can<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091580785">&quot;syndi oohhh, one more thing, do you all think we should sign up for<br/>
hslda?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My response is emphatically NO!<br/>
They are a profit organization, that is getting rich off of people&#39;s <br/>
fears. The lawyers they have wouldn&#39;t be able to represent you as <br/>
well as a local lawyer anyway, AND they won&#39;t represent unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
So no...don&#39;t waste your money on some fear of possible intervention <br/>
that probably will never happen. I had CPS show up wondering why my <br/>
kids weren&#39;t in school and we handled it all on our own without any <br/>
hassle. It&#39;s usually no big deal. If it IS a big deal and you need <br/>
help, there are better ways to get help.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend using NHEN for information and to find local attorneys <br/>
that are homeschool friendly.<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA has hurt homeschoolers more than they&#39;ve helped in my <br/>
opinion...here&#39;s a link if you want to know more:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268835832">Boy I&quot;m so glad I asked THAT question!  <br/>
They did a visit with us last year, dfs that is.  Of course found <br/>
nothing wrong here and thought hs&#39;ing our kids was the way to go.  <br/>
But I also got a call from them closing the case and saying we would <br/>
be on record as having a call made by the school for neglect (the not <br/>
going to school part). And it would be there for 7 years!  Really <br/>
burned me to learn this.  I&#39;m still trying to decide weather to <br/>
notify the school of our intent to hs.  Its not mandatory in Mo. I <br/>
just really don&#39;t want them knocking on my door again!<br/>
thanks SO much for the info!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-968169392">&quot;I said MIGHT want to call HSLDA. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m saying that isn&#39;t the best advice.<br/>
What if the person lives in a state like Alaska or Texas where <br/>
homeschoolers are not reuqired to report anything, not even an <br/>
intent to homeschool? What if they live in a very homeschool <br/>
friendly area, how would HSLDA be of use to them?<br/>
Even if they&#39;re in a rough area, the best advice you&#39;ll get is from <br/>
LOCAL unschoolers and organizations, not a national group.<br/>
I don&#39;t want HSLDA promoted as a helpful organization here, so I&#39;ll <br/>
question that advice anytime it&#39;s posted.<br/>
There are MUCH better ways to protect yourself, the foremost being <br/>
to educate yourself on the laws in your area.<br/>

HSLDA is a far right Christian group that thinks they need to meddle<br/>
with legislation and be the voice for all unschoolers. I don&#39;t<br/>
recommend supporting them at all!! They&#39;ve done more harm than good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Homeschool Legal Defense Association.  Wouldn&#39;t go near them.  They<br/>
are not supportive of unschooling.  While they say that they have<br/>
homeschoolers in their best interest, they have been known to defend<br/>
&quot;homeschoolers&quot; who are sheltering their children due to abuse issues.<br/>
 (yuck)  They are actually pro-more regulation of homeschoolers than<br/>
less-regulation (thus making it more difficult to homeschool than<br/>
easier - and ironically their reasoning for this is to discourage<br/>
people from abusing the homeschool laws so that they can cover abuse -<br/>
go figure!)   They&#39;ve also beein involved in some lobbying that has<br/>
nothing to do with homeschooling (that I can see) and is of a<br/>
political agenda that I do not support (conservative right wing).  I<br/>
also question the outrageously high association fee when compared with<br/>
the work that they are doing directly for homeschoolers.  IMO, if<br/>
there was some reason why the school board would take me to court it<br/>
would probably infringe on my civil liberties more than it would my<br/>
&quot;homeschooling rights&quot; so the ACLU (of which I am a card carrying<br/>
member) would be a better defense than HSLDA.  (and you don&#39;t have to<br/>
be a card carrying member for them to defend you!)<br/>

<br/>
Yes there is. You need to do your research and not let HSLDA fool you<br/>
into thinking they are the only ones interested in legal matters! They<br/>
promote this atmosphere of FEAR, so they can get memberships. They are<br/>
not using that membership money only to protect homeschoolers. They<br/>
have quite a far-reaching agenda and it&#39;s done a LOT to take away our<br/>
homeschooling freedoms. Supporting them is supporting loss of choice.<br/>

<br/>
NHEN.org also has good information. I can&#39;t believe that if all it<br/>
took was a well-formed letter, you really needed to pay for a membership.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428238522">Here in California, the inclusive state-level homeschool organization  <br/>
(HomeSchool Association of California) has volunteer attorneys, who  <br/>
are also homeschooling parents, who would have done the same thing  <br/>
for someone here, especially since all that HSLDA did was write a  <br/>
clarifying letter. The cost of the membership ($100?) would be a  <br/>
valuable donation to an all-volunteer organization.<br/>
