<div id="ygrps-yiv-11643762">And as ridiculous as it sounds, I think I&#39;m having withdrawal.  I<br/>
know, I said it was ridiculous.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling like maybe I didn&#39;t research this enough (so me), as I<br/>
loathe reading off of websites.  I&#39;ve certainly done some, but I am so<br/>
nervous.<br/>
<br/>
So far he has chosen only to watch TV and that is so hard for me. <br/>
Yesterday, he came over to where I was working (I volunteer for a<br/>
couple of organizations), and started leafing through the basket of<br/>
books next to me.  I asked if he wanted to read one of the Magic<br/>
Treehouse books together, and he said yes.  I immediately stopped what<br/>
I was doing (something I&#39;m not always good at), went over and sat with<br/>
him to read.  He grabs the remote and says &quot;you read, I&#39;ll watch&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, after my youngest, who is not feeling well, had fallen asleep<br/>
and woken up almost immediately, my tone was harsh even though I<br/>
didn&#39;t mean it to be.  The voice in my head was reminding me that this<br/>
was not the way to handle it and I did catch myself, but I could tell<br/>
he felt badly.  <br/>
<br/>
Ugh.  I am hoping today that he will want to go out and gather some<br/>
materials for some projects we&#39;ve been talking about, but I want to be<br/>
okay if he says no.  I just panic a bit that maybe he&#39;ll only watch TV<br/>
and truth be told, with how my district is, I&#39;m afraid of consequences<br/>
from the district.  I&#39;m pretty stressed about it, actually.  I do live<br/>
in NY, btw, which I saw someone had posted was a difficult state to<br/>
unschool in (I think that this was on another list though).<br/>
<br/>
Feedback appreciated,<br/>
<br/>

guess one of the hardest things for me about the shift is not having<br/>
validation that it is a change.  I&#39;ve long recognized that &quot;expecting&quot;<br/>
my kids to do or be whatever doesn&#39;t work, doesn&#39;t even make sense,<br/>
but I have fallen into some of the typical traps.  <br/>
<br/>
Something you all don&#39;t know about me is that I am more than willing<br/>
to look at myself.  I&#39;m also a therapist, so not only am I<br/>
self-reflective, I respond well to empathy ;-) which isn&#39;t the same as<br/>
condoning any action.  <br/>
<br/>
And the thing is, my fears are valid.  If I sent in my IHIP last year,<br/>
with a thorough lay out of what we would be covering, and it was<br/>
returned to me covered in red just b/c, it is a reality that I have to<br/>
be really careful following my heart and what I think is best for my<br/>
kids, lest the authorities become involved.  We have a very<br/>
controlling superintendent and it is not a pretty situation here.  <br/>
<br/>
So yeah, I&#39;m really nervous.  Not only am I stepping outside of my own<br/>
box, I&#39;m doing so with some real fears.  <br/>
<br/>
And yeah, the TV thing worries me and it&#39;s going to.  If this isn&#39;t a<br/>
proper place to discuss those worries, even as I &quot;allow&quot; them to<br/>
unfold (i.e. I&#39;m not stopping him from watching TV, it just gives me a<br/>
pit in my stomach), then please let me know.  I would never intend to<br/>
upset anyone, ever.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and yeah, my dh is an issue.  He&#39;s really a fantastic guy, but<br/>
he&#39;s not into hsing in general and forget unschooling.  He also works<br/>
from home which, wonderful as it can be, makes things tough too.  And<br/>
he&#39;s been horribly moody, which is so not him.  <br/>
<br/>
This may be more sharing than necessary, but I had really pushed for a<br/>
3rd child, and since have also insisted on not vaccinating my kids,<br/>
and now homeschooling.  I think he feels disillusioned.  He&#39;s stressed<br/>
by all the yelling and whining and fighting that happens in our house<br/>
(me too, and no not he and I, with rare exceptions).  He doesn&#39;t see<br/>
the harm of school and has some really traditional views.  Not being<br/>
confident in all my choices, I often feel caught.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t say all of this to get sympathy or pats on the back, or<br/>
whatever, but I do think it is important to understand where people<br/>
are coming from.  I&#39;ve been living the past couple of days with a pit<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-358744866">My son is like this, also. He doesn&#39;t normally enjoy beginning a<br/>
reading session by sitting down with me to read a book. He likes to<br/>
begin by having me start reading the book and him doing whatever he<br/>
wants to do... then, later, sometimes he gets caught up in the book<br/>
and leaves the other activity behind. Sometimes, he doesn&#39;t, though. <br/>
When he was in Kindergarten, (at public school) the teachers<br/>
complained that he would always want to be playing with items and<br/>
doing other things while they tried to read to the class. BUT, that<br/>
when asked about the stories - he could always answer the questions<br/>
correctly. It &quot;seemed&quot; like he wasn&#39;t paying attention to their<br/>
reading, and they were surprised that even though he had been playing<br/>
he was paying attention to the story also. He easily splits his<br/>
attention. But, the reader finds it &quot;offensive&quot; that they are reading<br/>
and the person who is being read to &quot;isn&#39;t paying attention the way<br/>
the reader thinks they should.&quot; Reading was a struggle, because people<br/>
were trying to force him to do it their way. <br/>
<br/>
I thought, for a time, that he didn&#39;t like having stories read to him.<br/>
But, that wasn&#39;t it. He didn&#39;t like having a reader who was offended<br/>
by the fact that he didn&#39;t have to sit there quietly and still, only<br/>
paying attention to the reader, to understand a story. I found this<br/>
out full force when I began checking out AudioBooks for him. He wanted<br/>
Peter Pan and Harry Potter. I got the AudioBooks so he could be free<br/>
to play with his legos, or computer games and listen to the story<br/>
whenever he felt like it. He completed both books and related many of<br/>
the events in them to me. He was listening to them, understanding them<br/>
and enjoying them. He didn&#39;t need anybody forcing him to sit still,<br/>
look at the book, pay attention, turn off the game, turn off the TV,<br/>
etc. I would say, don&#39;t take offense. Just start reading. My son often<br/>
will be playing Gameboy games when I start reading a book, and will<br/>
stop playing them when I get to exciting parts of the book. <br/>
<br/>
My Father In Law is like this, too. He is a computer/phone networking<br/>
genius and frequently must go back to school for new technology. He<br/>
listens to Audio Books to help him learn the new technology while he<br/>
is driving, working on his projects, running on his treadmill,<br/>
watching a TV show, playing computer games... Listening to the info<br/>
while engaged in other activities doesn&#39;t seem to hold him back in his<br/>
field of ever expanding technology. <br/>

Crawl up next to him and watch some tv too. Talk about the shows he is <br/>
watching. <br/>
<br/>
My kids truly, truly learn tons from tv. The Suite Life of Zach and <br/>
Cody gave my daughter lots of huge vocabulary words. My son loves <br/>
Mythbusters and How its Made. It all has value.. IT ALL HAS VALUE.<br/>
<br/>
Your son will not most likely watch tv forever. But during the time he <br/>
does connect with it, connect with him. <br/>
<br/>
Learning does not stop if no book is open, no worksheet present. <br/>
Learning is all the time. <br/>
<br/>
My kids and I watch Survivor. We often look at the globe and check out <br/>
what it is like where the people are. We discuss the morality and <br/>
ethics of each alliance and each tribal council. We connect through <br/>
this somewhat goofy show. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we cooked a pumpkin and then has a cooking frenzy. We <br/>
searched on the internet for pumpkin recipes. We watched the squash <br/>
become soft and then become delicous deserts. We weighed our <br/>
ingredients and discussed the boiling temperature and time it took. The <br/>
kids read each other nutritional value on the recipe.  The game goes <br/>
like this.  Someone is reading a label.  They ask how many grams of <br/>
sugar? The rest guess. Always informative&lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

myself of that frequently when I&#39;m in the middle of one! Maybe you <br/>
can tape big signs all over the house that say &quot;its not the <br/>
unschooling, its the Transition&quot; as a reminder.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try to see this as him asking for your company - some connection <br/>
with his mamma. See it also as a kind of creative problem-solving on <br/>
his part. He can tell that watching a lot of tv means less time with <br/>
mom, and he&#39;s not thrilled about that. He can tell that tv isn&#39;t <br/>
your thing - so he found a solution! Clever guy! I don&#39;t have any <br/>
idea if that&#39;s something you can use in terms of reporting or not - <br/>
I don&#39;t live in NY, but I do some &quot;reporting&quot; to Ray&#39;s bio mom. <br/>
Ray&#39;s a Very social learner, so I&#39;m often in the position of taking <br/>
what he&#39;s doing socially and looking for the learning and &quot;skill <br/>
building&quot; going on. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; okay if he says no.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he says no, could you go gather these materials yourself? Is it a <br/>
project y&#39;all could do in front of the tv? It does take some time to <br/>
shift the way you think about communicating and figuring things out <br/>
with your kids. Its convenient to just decide - maybe offer a few <br/>
options, but ultimately, that&#39;s still you deciding. Its nowhere near <br/>
as convenient to work things out together, especially at first. With <br/>
practice, it gets easier, I promise!<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s not interested in doing any kind of projects at all right <br/>
now, consider doing some yourself, for your own enjoyment, anyway. <br/>
Do them in the same room if possible, so y&#39;all can still enjoy each <br/>
other&#39;s company. <br/>

changing myself. I am so committed to making it work that I have found<br/>
myself almost 2 months in...the tv made me nuts at first and the most<br/>
helpful advice was to put lots of stuff around the tv to play with and<br/>
low and behold he now watches while playing with stuff...not all the<br/>
time but more and more. the changes are becoming obvious now as he is<br/>
becoming more of his own person rather than one of a group that he<br/>
spends time with everyday. it is truly amazing and at the same time<br/>
scary so I completely feel for you and encourage you to keep on<br/>
keeping on.<br/>
<br/>
good luck and know there are people right there with you <br/>

&gt; Try to see this as him asking for your company - some connection <br/>
&gt; with his mamma. See it also as a kind of creative problem-solving on <br/>
&gt; his part. He can tell that watching a lot of tv means less time with <br/>
&gt; mom, and he&#39;s not thrilled about that. He can tell that tv isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; your thing - so he found a solution! Clever guy! I don&#39;t have any <br/>
&gt; idea if that&#39;s something you can use in terms of reporting or not - <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t live in NY, but I do some &quot;reporting&quot; to Ray&#39;s bio mom. <br/>
&gt; Ray&#39;s a Very social learner, so I&#39;m often in the position of taking <br/>
&gt; what he&#39;s doing socially and looking for the learning and &quot;skill <br/>
&gt; building&quot; going on. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Ugh.  I am hoping today that he will want to go out and gather some<br/>
&gt; &gt; materials for some projects we&#39;ve been talking about, but I want <br/>
&gt; to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; okay if he says no.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If he says no, could you go gather these materials yourself? Is it a <br/>
&gt; project y&#39;all could do in front of the tv? It does take some time to <br/>
&gt; shift the way you think about communicating and figuring things out <br/>
&gt; with your kids. Its convenient to just decide - maybe offer a few <br/>
&gt; options, but ultimately, that&#39;s still you deciding. Its nowhere near <br/>
&gt; as convenient to work things out together, especially at first. With <br/>
&gt; practice, it gets easier, I promise!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If he&#39;s not interested in doing any kind of projects at all right <br/>
&gt; now, consider doing some yourself, for your own enjoyment, anyway. <br/>
&gt; Do them in the same room if possible, so y&#39;all can still enjoy each <br/>
&gt; other&#39;s company. <br/>

<br/>
But if you&#39;re looking for &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s tough, hang in there,&quot; types of  <br/>
responses it&#39;s not what you&#39;ll get here.<br/>
<br/>
The list is a great place to help people see a situation from a  <br/>
different direction so they can help themselves move on. It&#39;s not  <br/>
great for helping people feel comfortable where they are with their  <br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The list is a place to discuss anything people want to change to help  <br/>
them toward unschooling. If anyone doesn&#39;t want to actively work at  <br/>
changing or doesn&#39;t want an idea examined with an eye towards helping  <br/>
them get out of their own way as they work toward unschooling, it&#39;s  <br/>
best not to post the idea.<br/>
<br/>
Also, answers aren&#39;t intended exclusively for the person who posted.  <br/>
While the answers tend to address a specific situation, the  <br/>
understanding of the writers is that there may be a dozen or more  <br/>
people with the same situation. The responses are meant for them too.<br/>
<br/>
While this state of fear might be &quot;just where you are&quot; so to speak,  <br/>
I&#39;m betting your son is aware you&#39;re uncomfortable with his TV  <br/>
watching. It will be in your tone of voice and body language. It will  <br/>
be in the suggestions of what you offer to do. You won&#39;t be able to  <br/>
respond to &quot;Can I watch TV?&quot; with the same attitude as &quot;Can I read a  <br/>
book?&quot; No matter how hard you try to be neutral, your discomfort will  <br/>
be there.<br/>
<br/>
So, as far as fostering unschooling goes, it&#39;s best for new  <br/>
unschoolers to let go of their fears as soon as possible, or, while  <br/>
they&#39;re working on letting go, to &quot;fake it until they make it&quot; ;-) If  <br/>
you want ideas on how to let go of fears, people will be happy to  <br/>
offer what worked for them :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And the thing is, my fears are valid.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just because fears a valid -- and, yes, NY and PA are the two hardest  <br/>
states to unschool in -- doesn&#39;t mean your only option is to put up  <br/>
with the fears. There are lots of people in NY who have been where  <br/>
you are. They can help with suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sure, that&#39;s fair, but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a shift for me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As it was for all of us here :-) Just because you&#39;re not receiving  <br/>
&quot;Oh, wow, yeah, that was hard,&quot; responses, doesn&#39;t mean we haven&#39;t  <br/>
been through the experience and understand. It doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
a struggle for some of of the people here.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect, though, that what drives a lot of the people to volunteer  <br/>
their hours in helping others move toward unschooling comes with an  <br/>
understanding that acceptance of where one is isn&#39;t helpful. If I  <br/>
felt it was okay for people to put up with the problems in their  <br/>
lives, it wouldn&#39;t get me out of bed at 4:30 every morning for the  <br/>
past 13 years to say &quot;Oh, yeah, I know what you mean. I had problems  <br/>
with that too.&quot; The challenge in doing that would have been sucked  <br/>
out by the second post ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s challenging for unschooling writers to help people see the world  <br/>
in new ways. It&#39;s what drives a lot of people to post help. And  <br/>
people need a driving passionate reason to take time from their  <br/>
families to do something. I think the problem is that new unschoolers  <br/>
come to lists and a list *feels* like a bunch of women (usually)  <br/>
sitting around chatting while their kids play with each other. So it  <br/>
feels like someone can throw out &quot;Let me tell you about my bad day,&quot;  <br/>
and have others express sympathy and comfort. But the list isn&#39;t like  <br/>
that. This is work answering people&#39;s concerns. Challenging, fun  <br/>
(unpaid) work. If it weren&#39;t challenging or fun -- if it was merely  <br/>
an hour reading tales of people&#39;s miseries and offering &quot;Oh, that&#39;s  <br/>
too bad&quot; and other soothing words -- there&#39;s a whole pile of other  <br/>
things waiting for my time! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not mad or upset. I&#39;ve just been challenged for years to explain  <br/>
to people who come to lists expecting soothing words and getting  <br/>
upset that their lives get examined on a list that has intentionally  <br/>
gathered people who enjoy discussing. Neither I nor anyone else has  <br/>
been able to explain why the list is as it is and have someone say  <br/>
&quot;Oh, I get it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I<br/>
&gt; guess one of the hardest things for me about the shift is not having<br/>
&gt; validation that it is a change.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All shifts are change, of course. I assume you mean change for the  <br/>
better?<br/>
<br/>
Again, information is the best cure for fear. Read here:<br/>

Search for whatever fear you have in the archives at this list and I  <br/>
bet others have had the same one and it&#39;s been discussed :-)<br/>

There&#39;s no need to be a slave to fear or to any feeling, really. I  <br/>
think this society does a poor job with feelings. We&#39;re told to let  <br/>
them out or to hold them in, but not helped with the skills to take  <br/>
charge of our emotions by actively working at changing our view.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He also works<br/>
&gt; from home which, wonderful as it can be, makes things tough too.  And<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s been horribly moody, which is so not him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect this is an even bigger factor in your worries than NY  <br/>
rules. It&#39;s *hard* unschooling while a spouse is watching over  <br/>
looking for something that resembles &quot;learning&quot;, eg, something kids  <br/>
would do in school. It&#39;s quite possible the moodiness is him burying  <br/>
his worry as he trusts you, but it&#39;s building up. He&#39;s scared and  <br/>
he&#39;s worried because you&#39;re doing something weird that isn&#39;t  <br/>
comforting his fears. And you&#39;re afraid too! So your lack of  <br/>
confidence isn&#39;t helping him with his fears.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling conferences are great for Dads -- and Moms too :-)<br/>
<br/>
Try the Unschooling Circuit Riders yahoogroup. It&#39;s a low volume  <br/>
group that sends out periodic messages listing upcoming conferences.<br/>
<br/>
There are also conferences listed here:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He&#39;s stressed<br/>
&gt; by all the yelling and whining and fighting that happens in our house<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would be too.<br/>
<br/>
My first guess is you need to be more present. Be there *before* the  <br/>
kids can get to the yelling, whining and fighting stage. Learn to see  <br/>
the build up. Bring snacks. Get out of the house. Call one away to do  <br/>
something with you (like gathering snacks, folding towels, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that unschooling houses are models of peace and  <br/>
tranquility ;-) but yelling, whining and fighting are kids&#39; ways of  <br/>
communicating something&#39;s wrong. While we can&#39;t eliminate all of the  <br/>
conflict, we can get to a lot of it by being more present and more  <br/>
aware of what&#39;s going on.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read &quot;Siblings WIthout Rivalry&quot;. Excellent book. Very easy  <br/>
to read. Also, and more immediate:<br/>

it is naturally my inclination to validate where someone else even as I (and<br/>

Perhaps I misunderstand.<br/>

unschooling list to encourage activities or practices that are not in line<br/>
with that philosophy.  But I tend to be literal and logical and look into<br/>
things very deeply.  So, for example, when you said this, I find myself<br/>
trying on different possible meanings for what you said.<br/>

magic, but in other ways, this was reassuring that I&#39;m not alone.  There are<br/>
some deeply ingrained messages that I need to get rid of or have responses<br/>
in my head to.  Of course, at the end of the day, irregardless of my<br/>
husband&#39;s concerns or school district issues, I worry that this isn&#39;t the<br/>

&gt; in new ways. It&#39;s what drives a lot of people to post help. And<br/>
&gt; people need a driving passionate reason to take time from their<br/>
&gt; families to do something. I think the problem is that new unschoolers<br/>
&gt; come to lists and a list *feels* like a bunch of women (usually)<br/>
&gt; sitting around chatting while their kids play with each other. So it<br/>
&gt; feels like someone can throw out &quot;Let me tell you about my bad day,&quot;<br/>
&gt; and have others express sympathy and comfort. But the list isn&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; that. This is work answering people&#39;s concerns. Challenging, fun<br/>
&gt; (unpaid) work. If it weren&#39;t challenging or fun -- if it was merely<br/>
&gt; an hour reading tales of people&#39;s miseries and offering &quot;Oh, that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; too bad&quot; and other soothing words -- there&#39;s a whole pile of other<br/>
&gt; things waiting for my time! ;-)<br/>

and not directed toward the OP, I still would like to address what comes to<br/>
mind for me.  I put in tons of volunteer hours helping people work toward<br/>
change.  I run a chapter (and co-lead another) of the International Cesarean<br/>
Awareness Network and give lots of in person and online support to birthing<br/>
women.  And I find that a mixture of soothing words and validation of the<br/>
messages that people hear every day is a starting point.  Sometimes we only<br/>
have a short period of time (i.e. woman is &quot;due&quot; in a short time), and then<br/>
responses tend to be more pointed with less of the empathic responses b/c<br/>
it&#39;s decision making time.  A woman has to either decide to change her views<br/>
and often find a new provider if she chooses one, or she doesn&#39;t and she<br/>
leaves the group.  I just thought it might help to see how my perspective<br/>
has been colored, if you will.<br/>

&gt; upset that their lives get examined on a list that has intentionally<br/>
&gt; gathered people who enjoy discussing. Neither I nor anyone else has<br/>

&gt; There&#39;s no need to be a slave to fear or to any feeling, really. I<br/>
&gt; think this society does a poor job with feelings. We&#39;re told to let<br/>
&gt; them out or to hold them in, but not helped with the skills to take<br/>
&gt; charge of our emotions by actively working at changing our view.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I suspect this is an even bigger factor in your worries than NY<br/>
&gt; rules. It&#39;s *hard* unschooling while a spouse is watching over<br/>
&gt; looking for something that resembles &quot;learning&quot;, eg, something kids<br/>
&gt; would do in school. It&#39;s quite possible the moodiness is him burying<br/>
&gt; his worry as he trusts you, but it&#39;s building up. He&#39;s scared and<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s worried because you&#39;re doing something weird that isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; comforting his fears. And you&#39;re afraid too! So your lack of<br/>

moodiness.  I&#39;ve invited him to talk about it but thus far he hasn&#39;t taken<br/>
me up on it.  He doesn&#39;t outwardly express concerns about homeschooling any<br/>
more, but I *feel* it and I know my son does too.<br/>

&gt; I would be too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too.  My kids never used to fight.  I&#39;m not sure what happened.  Perhaps<br/>
the addition of a 3rd has just changed the dynamics enough to increase<br/>
fighting.  My oldest tends to try to get involved in everything, which<br/>
upsets the other two, and gets very offended if I ask him to remove himself<br/>
from the situation, no matter how much I thank him for his intent.  He also<br/>
gets his feelings hurt very easily which I&#39;m not sure how to handle.  I try<br/>
to be as gentle as possible, but it doesn&#39;t seem to matter.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My first guess is you need to be more present. Be there *before* the<br/>
&gt; kids can get to the yelling, whining and fighting stage. Learn to see<br/>
&gt; the build up. Bring snacks. Get out of the house. Call one away to do<br/>
&gt; something with you (like gathering snacks, folding towels, etc.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can try.  I&#39;ll admit to trying to finish things before the meltdowns,<br/>
which doesn&#39;t always work ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not that unschooling houses are models of peace and<br/>
&gt; tranquility ;-) but yelling, whining and fighting are kids&#39; ways of<br/>
&gt; communicating something&#39;s wrong. While we can&#39;t eliminate all of the<br/>
&gt; conflict, we can get to a lot of it by being more present and more<br/>
&gt; aware of what&#39;s going on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m definitely not good at this.  It&#39;s funny what you say about &quot;ways of<br/>
communicating&quot;.  I spend a lot of time wondering how their ways of<br/>
communication might relate to how they feel and to what they may have eaten<br/>
(food allergies again), so it&#39;s not a foreign concept to me, but I do think<br/>
that has been part of why I haven&#39;t been as present in other ways for them.<br/>
I&#39;m quite frankly exhausted trying to research this and that, figure out if<br/>
this or that is a symptom of another allergy, finding suitable meals and<br/>
snacks, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have you read &quot;Siblings WIthout Rivalry&quot;. Excellent book. Very easy<br/>
&gt; to read. Also, and more immediate:<br/>

not I will add it.  Thanks again.  I do hope you know that I appreciate your<br/>
responses even though some of it was/is confusing given the way my brain<br/>
works ;-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah. I think part of confusion is &quot;don&#39;t expect empathy here&quot; sounds  <br/>
like the owners or regular posters got together and agreed not to  <br/>
write empathetically.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not what happened. No decisions actual were made ;-) But years  <br/>
ago a core of posters who naturally write straight forward without  <br/>
the empathy drew readers who liked that style. And the readers stuck  <br/>
around, continuing to read and then write the way they liked to read.<br/>
<br/>
So, it&#39;s not that regular writers are reluctant to offer empathy.  <br/>
It&#39;s that this is a self-selected group that are drawn to an  <br/>
atmosphere where they don&#39;t expect or need empathy.<br/>
<br/>
And then people who do need empathy wander into a vibrant group that  <br/>
looks like what they need and end up wondering why there&#39;s no empathy!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; True, but I can&#39;t change where I am with the snap of my fingers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one would expect instant change. It&#39;s a constant process. I&#39;ve  <br/>
been unschooling for 13 years and there are still thoughts that trip  <br/>
me up occasionally. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the regular posters see change is not just an ongoing  <br/>
process but is best when it&#39;s an active process. And helping people  <br/>
to keep on moving forward is what they help with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A goal of<br/>
&gt; me posting is to hear from others if they had felt this way<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t hold your breath! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and what helped<br/>
&gt; them, which some people did and I appreciate very much.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you got some of what you needed.<br/>
<br/>
Direct questions do work best on this kind of list, though! :-)  <br/>
Expectations that a conversation will unfold according to certain  <br/>
social rules like &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Here&#39;s what I did,&quot; tend to lead to  <br/>
disappointment. Being direct about requests works lots better!<br/>
<br/>
(And you may have done that. Threads about a specific problem are  <br/>
easier to remember the flow of.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Of course, at the end of the day, irregardless of my<br/>
&gt; husband&#39;s concerns or school district issues, I worry that this  <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t the<br/>
&gt; best decision for him, that *my* decision to unschool will  <br/>
&gt; inadvertently not<br/>
&gt; take care of his needs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do you know that what you want to do will take care of his needs?<br/>
<br/>
How do parents know that school will take care of their children&#39;s  <br/>
needs?<br/>
<br/>
We tend to assume that everyone is going along because the thing  <br/>
they&#39;re doing works. But in the case of school or conventional  <br/>
parenting they&#39;re just trusting that it works. They&#39;ve seen kids come  <br/>
out of school and go to college and get jobs. (And they assume the  <br/>
kids who fail are to blame, not the process since it works for others.)<br/>
<br/>
How many adults do you know who are profoundly happy? Who don&#39;t feel  <br/>
trapped by what they spent all that money to acquire (the particular  <br/>
degree they have). How many adults do you know who jumped through all  <br/>
the hoops to get to the &quot;American Dream&quot; but have no idea who they  <br/>
really are? They don&#39;t know what they enjoy so they end up just going  <br/>
along. As they&#39;ve done since they entered school.<br/>
<br/>
What needs have been taken care of? And which haven&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is different. We aren&#39;t trusting that it will lead a  <br/>
child to a specific place (like college). We know that treating a  <br/>
child with respect (which means trusting their choices like TV ;-)  <br/>
creates whole people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Again, ime, acceptance of where a person finds themselves is an  <br/>
&gt; important<br/>
&gt; step toward change.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on the person.<br/>
<br/>
Some people understand &quot;Wherever you go, there you are.&quot; And to move  <br/>
toward unschooling, it&#39;s more useful to focus where they want to be  <br/>
rather than where they are.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the people who need to hear &quot;You&#39;re okay,&quot; don&#39;t stick  <br/>
around lists like this long because the regular posters just aren&#39;t  <br/>
the type who think to hand that kind of feedback out. I know I just  <br/>
assume it&#39;s understood that people are where they are. It&#39;s not part  <br/>
of my psyche to need validation for where I am so it doesn&#39;t occur to  <br/>
me to give it. What I want/need is help on getting where I want to  <br/>
be. And it&#39;s where my brain is when I answer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I find that a mixture of soothing words and validation of the<br/>
&gt; messages that people hear every day is a starting point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if you stick around long enough to get unschooling in a way that  <br/>
you can explain it to others, then that might be part of your natural  <br/>
style of explaining. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes we only<br/>
&gt; have a short period of time (i.e. woman is &quot;due&quot; in a short time),  <br/>
&gt; and then<br/>
&gt; responses tend to be more pointed with less of the empathic  <br/>
&gt; responses b/c<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s decision making time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think where a lot of the regular posters&#39; heads are at is seeing  <br/>
kids in the house as the same as being &quot;due&quot;. Kids don&#39;t have years  <br/>
for a parent to figure this out. While 38 might not be hugely  <br/>
different from 36 or 41, for a child, that span of years might be  <br/>
their whole life if they&#39;re 5. An unschooling practice that a parent  <br/>
is waiting to &quot;get&quot; has been absent from the child&#39;s whole life. And  <br/>
if another 5 years goes by? And other? They&#39;re practically grown.<br/>
<br/>
Is that the only way to see things? No. (Though I think the kids  <br/>
would lean towards the viewpoint of the regular posters ;-) But it is  <br/>
the kind of help this kind of list gives just because that&#39;s the kind  <br/>
of people who&#39;ve hung around.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess I don&#39;t necessarily think that by changing one&#39;s<br/>
&gt; view, that emotions are resolved in the process.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not immediately. And the shift is something that consciously needs  <br/>
worked at for quite some time. But the more thoughts are pulled up  <br/>
out of familiar ruts, the easier it gets to keep them out of the ruts.<br/>
<br/>
For example, it&#39;s very easy to fall into the rut of reacting with  <br/>
anger at kids for making deliberate messes, like dumping the whole  <br/>
tub of Legos out, for instance. If you&#39;ve got a child who&#39;s a dumper,  <br/>
reacting to his natural inclination with anger, even suppressed anger  <br/>
that you take somewhere else, is going to have negative effects on  <br/>
the relationship. Can you just turn that anger off? No, of course  <br/>
not. But a parent doesn&#39;t need to be a slave to it, either. And if  <br/>
someone had that problem, they could ask here, ask what other parents  <br/>
did about angers flared by irritation. People might come back with a  <br/>
slew of ideas that are wide ranging to tackle it from several  <br/>
direction: do your own dumping and revel in it :-), find smaller  <br/>
bins, put down a drop cloth and help the child remember to dump  <br/>
there, smell their hair to remind you how sweet they are :-) and so  <br/>
on and so on.<br/>
<br/>
It helps a lot to see the anger as something you [general &quot;you&quot;]  <br/>
don&#39;t want. To not see it as something that you just have to put up  <br/>
with because that&#39;s who you are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My oldest tends to try to get involved in everything, which<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You might try giving a few typical scenarios. (Preferably in a  <br/>
separate thread just so it gets its own attention.)<br/>
<br/>
You might try calling him away to do something rather than telling  <br/>
him to remove himself. If you were trying to get everyone moving in  <br/>
the direction you thought best and your husband stepped in and told  <br/>
you to remove yourself, wouldn&#39;t you feel miffed?<br/>

feel wrong? It&#39;s hard to suggest without specific examples.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; snacks, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if it&#39;s just who they are?<br/>
<br/>
It might be allergies but it would do them more good to help them  <br/>
find coping skills rather than seeing some unknown ailment. They are  <br/>
who they are in the moment, whether it&#39;s caused by genetics or food  <br/>
chemicals. If they&#39;re having problems relating to each other, they  <br/>
need help now, not more research. I&#39;m sure you are helping, but if  <br/>
your head is in the &quot;I need to find the allergen that&#39;s causing this&quot;  <br/>
mode, then you&#39;re not as present with them and what they&#39;re feeling  <br/>
right now as you could be. What if you never do find out? And they&#39;re  <br/>
still having problems at 15? It will serve their future selves a lot  <br/>
better to help them find ways to cope with what they&#39;re feeling now,  <br/>
than to tackle it full on when they&#39;re older and you&#39;re convinced you  <br/>
can&#39;t figure out what they&#39;re allergic to.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean stop researching. It means put most of your  <br/>
energies into helping them cope in the situations they have today. If  <br/>
you give some examples, some people might be able to help.<br/>

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
The people in this list are busy. They have full lives, some multiple kids, others full time jobs and most lots of commitments.<br/>
There is no time to it for some. Foir others is just not their style.<br/>
I don;t have time honestly. I have little kids and I never stop ( check what time I wrote this post!&lt;BWG&gt;)<br/>
Speaking for myself I just write in a direct way.<br/>
I assume that people asking questions want to change and want straight answers.<br/>
I am not a a trained therapist.<br/>
Our kids are growing fast.<br/>
Many here take time away form their life to write and help others.<br/>
I honestly find it somewhat rude that people sometimes come to the list and want to tell others how they should write.,<br/>
These are people that are not getting payed to help anyone.<br/>
They do it for free and willing.  No one has to take the advice. They can choose to not read the posts from people that write in a style they don&#39;t like.<br/>
When I come here with questions I want to be challenged. I want to get my butt kicked and I want to change NOW.<br/>
Some one telling me how great I am doing, or patting me on the back is not going to help me get very far.<br/>

I want to move miles and miles.<br/>
We all get it it is hard. We all struggle everyday. We all had a lot to change. The longer you do it and the more you are willing<br/>
to challenge yourself the easier it get.<br/>
It seems the OP is open to it&lt;G&gt;<br/>
That is great.<br/>
Be accepting that people will write they way they will write and not the way you want them to write.<br/>

I asked if he wanted to read one of the Magic Treehouse books <br/>

As you progress forward into your unschooling, you&#39;ll find your son <br/>
has a very different way of learning. Talk about uniqueness!! It is <br/>
only thru unschooling will you see your child&#39;s uniqueness unfold and <br/>
blossom, without any external intervention.  <br/>
<br/>
Think of your child as a Flower. You wouldn&#39;t prod and probe a flower <br/>
to blossom faster, will you? You won&#39;t tell the flower how to bloom <br/>
and which petal to bloom first, will you? <br/>
<br/>
So think of your child as a Flower, who knows when and how and which <br/>
petal to bloom. <br/>
<br/>
Think of all his tv watching as the many petals unfolding. Think of <br/>
all the things he&#39;s doing, things you like, things you don&#39;t like, as <br/>
his many petals unfolding. <br/>
<br/>
You wouldn&#39;t tell the flower &quot;Ohh, you&#39;re blooming on one side frst, <br/>
you should have unfurled sysmentrically on all sides. You&#39;re doing it <br/>
wrong? I dn&#39;t like this flower. It looks funny&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No you won&#39;t. You will wait for it to fully bloom because you trust <br/>
that it will eventually bloomed into a beautiful flower. <br/>
<br/>
So think of your son as a Flower. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son is the type that will be doing 2 or 3 different thing at the <br/>
same time, like listen to his cartoon show on the tv, build some Lego <br/>
and play with his DS at the same time. He does the most wierdest thing <br/>
ever, but it is HIS way of making sense and learning all the time.  <br/>
<br/>
He does his pocket money talk and &quot;window shopping&quot; in his head with <br/>
me while swinging himself on his Dad&#39;s exercise machine, counting <br/>
money but yet eyes on tv AND on the calorie counter on the machine <br/>
LOL! <br/>
<br/>
He turns over in bed during bedtime, listening to me reading him his <br/>
stories. It doesn&#39;t mean he is not listening, he is just focusing on <br/>
something else while listening. And yes, I have read to him while he <br/>
played his Lego Star War on his ps2.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In order for me to stand back and not interfere with my child&#39;s <br/>
blossoming, I had to have the patience and trust to stand back and <br/>
wait and observe. <br/>
<br/>
In the beginning, I can&#39;t, it&#39;s so hard. Every minute of my existance, <br/>
I have to stop and examine what I am doing consiously, trying to stay <br/>
in spirit of unschooling but yet I&#39;m not feeling that calm and <br/>
happiness that comes with it. I&#39;m getting more and more frustrated <br/>
with my self. This in turn, spill into fire of resentment, and inturn <br/>
nearly burnt my flower. <br/>
<br/>
So I had to stand back, and keep calm before I singe my flower.  <br/>
<br/>
So I told myself, this is too tiring and hard work. I can&#39;t keep <br/>
pretending I&#39;m doing ok because I&#39;m not. Maybe because I haven&#39;t <br/>
understood this unschooling enough. But I am not giving up. I just had <br/>
to figure out a better way so I&#39;m continue reading and learning. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m thinking maybe, DS can continue to occupy himself with whatever <br/>
he wants while mummy focus on learning more about unschooling first. <br/>
<br/>
So yes, an Eureka moment- that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do. I&#39;ll learn all I can <br/>
about unschooling first, in the first year, before I include DS into <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
So I took one year sabbatical from being a &quot;do everything right mum&quot;,  <br/>
reading and being with DS, playing and doing whatever he wants and <br/>
surprise surprise, my son continuied to bloom and blossom in all <br/>
directions, without me doing anything. <br/>
<br/>
When I finally finished exhauting my quench for more info, me and DS <br/>
was already living unschooling successfully at month 16, painlessly, <br/>
sub-consciously.   <br/>
<br/>
So our secret in our success in unschooling really started with me <br/>
UNSCHOOLING myself first!!LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Letting go is the most important part of my unschooling. And I did it <br/>
my way, by distracting myself away from needing to do everything <br/>
right. But it ws because of my &quot;need to do everything right&quot; that got <br/>
me on a different track, away from focusing strongly on DS. Instead, I <br/>
was living parellel with my son. <br/>
<br/>
I was doing my &quot;learning&quot;, and he was doing his playing and tvs and <br/>
ps2.  Which is why we can constantly be found sitting side by side <br/>
each other on the sofa. In the library, him on the computer playing <br/>
online games, me looking for more books.  We were doing alot of things <br/>
together happily.  <br/>
<br/>
There were days I got fed-up of reading, so I suggest we go out <br/>
somewhere for a change of scenery- visit friends, playing in the park. <br/>
And idea gladly welcomed because I&#39;ll was truly enjoying this break, <br/>
just as much as him. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for Hubby, I told him truthfully that I&#39;m still reading up on it, <br/>
but to be quite frank, I have no clue what we&#39;re doing. I told him <br/>
<br/>
&quot; All I know is that unschooling couldn&#39;t possibly do anymore harm <br/>
than school did to our son&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;So, while I am doing my unschooling studies, DS will be doing alot of <br/>
playing&quot; I told hubby.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Someone on the list gave me a very good piece of advice - take it 1 <br/>
year at the time, and at the end of the year, re-assess what you&#39;ve <br/>
done and only then decide if you wanna continue or stop&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And so the 1 year mark was our personal target. This was also a sign <br/>
of my hubby&#39;s commitment to help with this unschooling business.    <br/>
<br/>
We talk alot about unschooling. I know he hasn&#39;t got the time to learn <br/>
and understand and read about unschooling. He also hasn&#39;t got the <br/>
luxury to stay at home and see all the little Eurekas that son has <br/>
shown me. <br/>
<br/>
I needed him to be involve, to be a partner of this and not sidelined, <br/>
thinking it is my duty since I&#39;m the one staying at home and the <br/>
mother.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I got hubby involved in a sort of sneaky way but truly, my eyes were <br/>
hurting from too much reading off the laptop, so I asked if he could <br/>
be kind enough to print out the unschooling stuff that I&#39;ve emailed to <br/>
him. I&#39;ve have snuck in stuffs that I need him to &quot;glance thu&quot; like <br/>
deschooling and tv stuffs LOL! <br/>
<br/>
This way gave my hubby a glimpse of hwat everyone is doing unschooling <br/>
wise, and also confidence that I am DOING/ working towards something.  <br/>
<br/>
But I had many opportunity along the way to point out all those <br/>
fantastic and interesting things that DS did to hubby. It wasn&#39;t <br/>
difficult becuase everything DS did, without any of my intervention or <br/>
instigation, is surprising and amazing enough to catch our attention.  <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m not talking about doing maths or science experiments or any <br/>
other scholarly feats. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m talking about my child repeating what he saw on tv to hubby. <br/>
<br/>
My child is talking non stop. He is a walking encyclopedia. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s constantly informing us about his understanding and discovery <br/>
from comparison about time zone to the Lego building he made, to his <br/>
character on Grand Theft Auto rescuing other characters from being <br/>
rob. <br/>
<br/>
My child had many &quot;spider pets&quot; in our garden. He will find bugs or <br/>
caterpillars to feed each and every spider that can be found in our <br/>
garden. And about the bumble bees on our Lavender bush. <br/>
<br/>
His understanding that him mummy and daddy each had very different tv <br/>
shows that we like, and he&#39;s happy to watch it all too. He sets tv <br/>
reminders for us all. <br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s into burning stuff the past 2 months and is having lots of fun <br/>
doing it and informing us of all his discoveries.  <br/>
<br/>
This is what I mean,  stand back, and watching your child unfold his <br/>
trueself to you. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Today, my hubby is a true believer of unschooling. He will talk <br/>
confidently to anyone about unschooling and our child&#39;s amazing self.  <br/>
A big change for someone who believed &quot;rules are rules, and need to be <br/>
followed&quot; LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
After 23 months of unschooling, I still get hick-ups here and there <br/>
occasionally. But I understood the problem lies in me, and not my <br/>
child. And it normally starts when I start &quot;expecting something&quot; LOL!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s not what happened. No decisions actual were made ;-) But years<br/>
&gt; ago a core of posters who naturally write straight forward without<br/>

&gt; inadvertently not<br/>
&gt; take care of his needs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;How do you know that what you want to do will take care of his needs?<br/>
<br/>
How do parents know that school will take care of their children&#39;s<br/>
needs?<br/>
<br/>
We tend to assume that everyone is going along because the thing<br/>
they&#39;re doing works. But in the case of school or conventional<br/>
parenting they&#39;re just trusting that it works. They&#39;ve seen kids come<br/>
out of school and go to college and get jobs. (And they assume the<br/>
kids who fail are to blame, not the process since it works for others.)<br/>
<br/>
How many adults do you know who are profoundly happy? Who don&#39;t feel<br/>
trapped by what they spent all that money to acquire (the particular<br/>
degree they have). How many adults do you know who jumped through all<br/>
the hoops to get to the &quot;American Dream&quot; but have no idea who they<br/>
really are? They don&#39;t know what they enjoy so they end up just going<br/>
along. As they&#39;ve done since they entered school.<br/>
<br/>
What needs have been taken care of? And which haven&#39;t?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for those questions!!!!  They are so incredibly helpful to my<br/>
process.  You&#39;re absolutely right--his needs weren&#39;t being met in school,<br/>
they weren&#39;t being met by traditional &quot;school at home&quot; and they aren&#39;t being<br/>
met by the way we have been relating to him.  As a funny aside, we are<br/>
currently watching Fetch with Ruff Ruffman (a PBS show) and I&#39;m typing away<br/>
to you all.  Funny how I thought it was perfectly okay to be &quot;present&quot; with<br/>
him in this way, but it was too distracting for him to play with something<br/>
while I read.  Hmm.  So much food for thought.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Unschooling is different. We aren&#39;t trusting that it will lead a<br/>
child to a specific place (like college). We know that treating a<br/>
child with respect (which means trusting their choices like TV ;-)<br/>
creates whole people.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for sharing your perspective.  You&#39;ve given me so much to think<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Again, ime, acceptance of where a person finds themselves is an<br/>
&gt; important<br/>
&gt; step toward change.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Depends on the person.<br/>
<br/>
Some people understand &quot;Wherever you go, there you are.&quot; And to move<br/>
toward unschooling, it&#39;s more useful to focus where they want to be<br/>
rather than where they are.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the people who need to hear &quot;You&#39;re okay,&quot; don&#39;t stick<br/>
around lists like this long because the regular posters just aren&#39;t<br/>
the type who think to hand that kind of feedback out. I know I just<br/>
assume it&#39;s understood that people are where they are. It&#39;s not part<br/>
of my psyche to need validation for where I am so it doesn&#39;t occur to<br/>
me to give it. What I want/need is help on getting where I want to<br/>
be. And it&#39;s where my brain is when I answer.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I find that a mixture of soothing words and validation of the<br/>
&gt; messages that people hear every day is a starting point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;And if you stick around long enough to get unschooling in a way that<br/>
you can explain it to others, then that might be part of your natural<br/>
style of explaining. :-)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For sure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes we only<br/>
&gt; have a short period of time (i.e. woman is &quot;due&quot; in a short time),<br/>
&gt; and then<br/>
&gt; responses tend to be more pointed with less of the empathic<br/>
&gt; responses b/c<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s decision making time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I think where a lot of the regular posters&#39; heads are at is seeing<br/>
kids in the house as the same as being &quot;due&quot;. Kids don&#39;t have years<br/>
for a parent to figure this out. While 38 might not be hugely<br/>
different from 36 or 41, for a child, that span of years might be<br/>
their whole life if they&#39;re 5. An unschooling practice that a parent<br/>
is waiting to &quot;get&quot; has been absent from the child&#39;s whole life. And<br/>
if another 5 years goes by? And other? They&#39;re practically grown.<br/>
<br/>
Is that the only way to see things? No. (Though I think the kids<br/>
would lean towards the viewpoint of the regular posters ;-) But it is<br/>
the kind of help this kind of list gives just because that&#39;s the kind<br/>
of people who&#39;ve hung around.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This intrigues me so much.  I sometimes feel like I&#39;m on a rollercoaster. My<br/>
visceral response to the first paragraph above was that pit in the stomach<br/>
feeling, that somehow I&#39;m damaging my kids by not learning fast enough.  I<br/>
literally have to fight the voices of the majority in my head, which of<br/>
course say that they won&#39;t have the advantages of unschooling in &quot;the real<br/>
world&quot;.  Even though I&#39;m always countering with the general concept that<br/>
just b/c &quot;the real world&quot; won&#39;t be like our family necessarily, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
I can&#39;t give them what I&#39;m capable of now.  If you knew the stories of my<br/>
family of origin....oh my.  So, I&#39;m constantly filtering incoming<br/>
information through different sieves, if you will.<br/>
<br/>
For now, I&#39;m working on the &quot;fake it til you make it&quot; piece.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess I don&#39;t necessarily think that by changing one&#39;s<br/>
&gt; view, that emotions are resolved in the process.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Not immediately. And the shift is something that consciously needs<br/>
worked at for quite some time. But the more thoughts are pulled up<br/>
out of familiar ruts, the easier it gets to keep them out of the ruts.<br/>
<br/>
For example, it&#39;s very easy to fall into the rut of reacting with<br/>
anger at kids for making deliberate messes, like dumping the whole<br/>
tub of Legos out, for instance. If you&#39;ve got a child who&#39;s a dumper,<br/>
reacting to his natural inclination with anger, even suppressed anger<br/>
that you take somewhere else, is going to have negative effects on<br/>
the relationship. Can you just turn that anger off? No, of course<br/>
not. But a parent doesn&#39;t need to be a slave to it, either. And if<br/>
someone had that problem, they could ask here, ask what other parents<br/>
did about angers flared by irritation. People might come back with a<br/>
slew of ideas that are wide ranging to tackle it from several<br/>
direction: do your own dumping and revel in it :-), find smaller<br/>
bins, put down a drop cloth and help the child remember to dump<br/>
there, smell their hair to remind you how sweet they are :-) and so<br/>
on and so on.<br/>
<br/>
It helps a lot to see the anger as something you [general &quot;you&quot;]<br/>
don&#39;t want. To not see it as something that you just have to put up<br/>
with because that&#39;s who you are.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very, very helpful.  Thanks so much!<br/>

<br/>
Yes, come to think of it, when I have done this, it has worked much better.<br/>
This may sound funny, and not sure I can articulate it well, but I guess<br/>
I&#39;ve believed in being totally honest, and this has felt a bit manipulative<br/>
when I do this.  To give another example, I&#39;m honest almost to a fault.  I<br/>
can&#39;t remember the exact example, but he had asked me once if something<br/>
could happen.  The typical response is to reassure your child that all will<br/>
be okay.  That didn&#39;t feel totally honest, so I admitted that there could be<br/>
exceptions.  My dh thought that was waay over the top.  Did I mention I am<br/>
literal and a need to know person ;-)?  But, no, I think those are great<br/>
ideas.  Sometimes I definitely get in the way of myself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He alsogets his feelings hurt very easily which I&#39;m not sure how to<br/>
&gt; handle. I try<br/>
&gt; to be as gentle as possible, but it doesn&#39;t seem to matter.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Empathy? Does he maybe feel like you&#39;re trying to fix him? Does he<br/>
feel wrong? It&#39;s hard to suggest without specific examples.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to come up with specific examples, but yes, I think he feels<br/>
&quot;wrong&quot; most of the time.  And I feel stuck when there are things that need<br/>
to be re-directed (like him scaring the dog, or slamming the door with his<br/>
brother right there).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m quite frankly exhausted trying to research this and that,<br/>
&gt; figure out if<br/>
&gt; this or that is a symptom of another allergy, finding suitable<br/>
&gt; meals and<br/>
&gt; snacks, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What if it&#39;s just who they are?<br/>
<br/>
It might be allergies but it would do them more good to help them<br/>
find coping skills rather than seeing some unknown ailment. They are<br/>
who they are in the moment, whether it&#39;s caused by genetics or food<br/>
chemicals. If they&#39;re having problems relating to each other, they<br/>
need help now, not more research. I&#39;m sure you are helping, but if<br/>
your head is in the &quot;I need to find the allergen that&#39;s causing this&quot;<br/>
mode, then you&#39;re not as present with them and what they&#39;re feeling<br/>
right now as you could be. What if you never do find out? And they&#39;re<br/>
still having problems at 15? It will serve their future selves a lot<br/>
better to help them find ways to cope with what they&#39;re feeling now,<br/>
than to tackle it full on when they&#39;re older and you&#39;re convinced you<br/>
can&#39;t figure out what they&#39;re allergic to.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean stop researching. It means put most of your<br/>
energies into helping them cope in the situations they have today. If<br/>
you give some examples, some people might be able to help.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, fwiw, when it comes to behavioral manifestations of allergies, I&#39;ve<br/>
pretty much tabled that for another time.  I focus on the immediate concerns<br/>
which are whether the foods they are eating are damaging their bodies.  My<br/>
youngest has symptoms of food allergies which could become life-threatening,<br/>
and I feel it is very important to figure those out.  I do at times wonder<br/>
if my oldest might react to corn and dyes, etc, but for now, I&#39;ve chosen to<br/>
accept him as he is and not try to change it.   So, I do try to find a<br/>
balance too and keep it in perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I will try to come up with examples.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, wow, yeah, that was hard,&quot; responses, doesn&#39;t mean we haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; been through the experience and understand. It doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; a struggle for some of of the people here.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; May I ask what the hesistance to such responses might be?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The people in this list are busy. They have full lives, some multiple kids,<br/>
&gt; others full time jobs and most lots of commitments.<br/>
&gt; There is no time to it for some. Foir others is just not their style.<br/>
&gt; I don;t have time honestly. I have little kids and I never stop ( check<br/>
&gt; what time I wrote this post!&lt;BWG&gt;)<br/>
&gt; Speaking for myself I just write in a direct way.<br/>
&gt; I assume that people asking questions want to change and want straight<br/>
&gt; answers.<br/>
&gt; I am not a a trained therapist.<br/>
&gt; Our kids are growing fast.<br/>
&gt; Many here take time away form their life to write and help others.<br/>
&gt; I honestly find it somewhat rude that people sometimes come to the list and<br/>
&gt; want to tell others how they should write.,<br/>
&gt; These are people that are not getting payed to help anyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m honestly not sure how to respond.  Of course everyone is busy.  I assume<br/>
that people who don&#39;t have time to respond, won&#39;t.  You all may remember<br/>
that it took me a good 2 weeks to respond to the group replies to my intro.<br/>
And sometimes, I might not get to responding.<br/>
<br/>
As for being rude, that is never my intent.  Nor would I ever tell people<br/>
what to write.  I was offering feedback on how I learn best, and what I&#39;ve<br/>
observed over my years of participating in yahoo groups of all types (ICAN,<br/>
Celiac and foodallergy groups, sexual abuse groups, and birth trauma groups<br/>
etc.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; They do it for free and willing.  No one has to take the advice. They<br/>
&gt; can choose to not read the posts from people that write in a style they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I do this all the time.  I&#39;ve learned over the years that some people&#39;s<br/>
replies just aren&#39;t worth the rise in my bp ;-) even though I felt rude not<br/>
reading what they wrote.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; When I come here with questions I want to be challenged. I want to get my<br/>
&gt; butt kicked and I want to change NOW.<br/>
&gt; Some one telling me how great I am doing, or patting me on the back is not<br/>
&gt; going to help me get very far.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it helps, I had the same responses to one of my food allergy groups.  B/c<br/>
they feel like a child&#39;s health is at stake, they tend not to be very<br/>
empathic.  I go there for the reality check, but also for a reminder that<br/>
there is another side of this frustration I&#39;m experiencing atm.  But I also<br/>
see the value of validation that it can be frustrating when you can&#39;t figure<br/>
out what&#39;s going on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I may move a few tenths of a mile .<br/>
&gt; I want to move miles and miles.<br/>
&gt; We all get it it is hard. We all struggle everyday. We all had a lot to<br/>
&gt; change. The longer you do it and the more you are willing<br/>
&gt; to challenge yourself the easier it get.<br/>
&gt; It seems the OP is open to it&lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt; That is great.<br/>
&gt; Be accepting that people will write they way they will write and not the<br/>
&gt; way you want them to write.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure, I&#39;m very open.  I&#39;m scared but excited.  These conversations have<br/>
helped me to understand the approach of the group.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your reply!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you progress forward into your unschooling, you&#39;ll find your son<br/>

&gt; and which petal to bloom first, will you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So think of your child as a Flower, who knows when and how and which<br/>
&gt; petal to bloom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Think of all his tv watching as the many petals unfolding. Think of<br/>
&gt; all the things he&#39;s doing, things you like, things you don&#39;t like, as<br/>
&gt; his many petals unfolding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You wouldn&#39;t tell the flower &quot;Ohh, you&#39;re blooming on one side frst,<br/>
&gt; you should have unfurled sysmentrically on all sides. You&#39;re doing it<br/>
&gt; wrong? I dn&#39;t like this flower. It looks funny&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No you won&#39;t. You will wait for it to fully bloom because you trust<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So think of your son as a Flower.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son is the type that will be doing 2 or 3 different thing at the<br/>
&gt; same time, like listen to his cartoon show on the tv, build some Lego<br/>
&gt; and play with his DS at the same time. He does the most wierdest thing<br/>
&gt; ever, but it is HIS way of making sense and learning all the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He does his pocket money talk and &quot;window shopping&quot; in his head with<br/>
&gt; me while swinging himself on his Dad&#39;s exercise machine, counting<br/>
&gt; money but yet eyes on tv AND on the calorie counter on the machine<br/>
&gt; LOL!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He turns over in bed during bedtime, listening to me reading him his<br/>
&gt; stories. It doesn&#39;t mean he is not listening, he is just focusing on<br/>
&gt; something else while listening. And yes, I have read to him while he<br/>
&gt; played his Lego Star War on his ps2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In order for me to stand back and not interfere with my child&#39;s<br/>
&gt; blossoming, I had to have the patience and trust to stand back and<br/>
&gt; wait and observe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the beginning, I can&#39;t, it&#39;s so hard. Every minute of my existance,<br/>
&gt; I have to stop and examine what I am doing consiously, trying to stay<br/>
&gt; in spirit of unschooling but yet I&#39;m not feeling that calm and<br/>
&gt; happiness that comes with it. I&#39;m getting more and more frustrated<br/>
&gt; with my self. This in turn, spill into fire of resentment, and inturn<br/>
&gt; nearly burnt my flower.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I understand.  I think this is where I was a few months ago and even<br/>
somewhat recently, but in the past few days, I&#39;m feeling more calm and a lot<br/>
of that is hearing about your experiences and knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I had to stand back, and keep calm before I singe my flower.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I told myself, this is too tiring and hard work. I can&#39;t keep<br/>
&gt; pretending I&#39;m doing ok because I&#39;m not. Maybe because I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; understood this unschooling enough. But I am not giving up. I just had<br/>
&gt; to figure out a better way so I&#39;m continue reading and learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I&#39;m thinking maybe, DS can continue to occupy himself with whatever<br/>
&gt; he wants while mummy focus on learning more about unschooling first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good idea, thanks!  Silly as it sounds, I need to give myself permission to<br/>
be where I&#39;m at.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So yes, an Eureka moment- that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do. I&#39;ll learn all I can<br/>
&gt; about unschooling first, in the first year, before I include DS into<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I took one year sabbatical from being a &quot;do everything right mum&quot;,<br/>
&gt; reading and being with DS, playing and doing whatever he wants and<br/>
&gt; surprise surprise, my son continuied to bloom and blossom in all<br/>
&gt; directions, without me doing anything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I finally finished exhauting my quench for more info, me and DS<br/>
&gt; was already living unschooling successfully at month 16, painlessly,<br/>
&gt; sub-consciously.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So our secret in our success in unschooling really started with me<br/>
&gt; UNSCHOOLING myself first!!LOL!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know this is huge.  Tammy Takahashi (sp?) who wrote Deschooling Gently,<br/>
talks about the great benefits she received when her dh got a job across the<br/>
country so she unenrolled in many of her grad classes and focused on the<br/>
ones she enjoyed.  She was no longer a slave to her schedule.  So, with<br/>
trepidation, I look to let go.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Letting go is the most important part of my unschooling. And I did it<br/>
&gt; my way, by distracting myself away from needing to do everything<br/>
&gt; right. But it ws because of my &quot;need to do everything right&quot; that got<br/>
&gt; me on a different track, away from focusing strongly on DS. Instead, I<br/>
&gt; was living parellel with my son.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was doing my &quot;learning&quot;, and he was doing his playing and tvs and<br/>
&gt; ps2. Which is why we can constantly be found sitting side by side<br/>
&gt; each other on the sofa. In the library, him on the computer playing<br/>
&gt; online games, me looking for more books. We were doing alot of things<br/>
&gt; together happily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There were days I got fed-up of reading, so I suggest we go out<br/>
&gt; somewhere for a change of scenery- visit friends, playing in the park.<br/>
&gt; And idea gladly welcomed because I&#39;ll was truly enjoying this break,<br/>

&gt; As for Hubby, I told him truthfully that I&#39;m still reading up on it,<br/>
&gt; but to be quite frank, I have no clue what we&#39;re doing. I told him<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot; All I know is that unschooling couldn&#39;t possibly do anymore harm<br/>
&gt; than school did to our son&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;So, while I am doing my unschooling studies, DS will be doing alot of<br/>

also got together with a friend who has been having some marriage<br/>
difficulties.  It put so much into perspective.  I came home, gave him a big<br/>
long hug and we reconnected.  I had already shared that many of you<br/>
expressed empathy for him (which I shared as well, but it gave me a<br/>
conversation starter, lol), and I reminded him that he always knew I was<br/>
&quot;different&quot;, lol, but that I know this has all been a change for him, all of<br/>
us really.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; &quot;Someone on the list gave me a very good piece of advice - take it 1<br/>

&quot;what if this isn&#39;t working for him and I don&#39;t see it?&quot;, yk?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And so the 1 year mark was our personal target. This was also a sign<br/>
&gt; of my hubby&#39;s commitment to help with this unschooling business.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We talk alot about unschooling. I know he hasn&#39;t got the time to learn<br/>
&gt; and understand and read about unschooling. He also hasn&#39;t got the<br/>
&gt; luxury to stay at home and see all the little Eurekas that son has<br/>
&gt; shown me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I needed him to be involve, to be a partner of this and not sidelined,<br/>

attitude that it doesn&#39;t matter what he thinks.  Which, quite frankly, is a<br/>
big part of the problem between us.  He doesn&#39;t articulate well, but I&#39;ve<br/>
gathered that he feels this way too.  So, I just keep assuring him that it<br/>
does matter, I am listening, but I am also listening to our son and trying<br/>
to do what is best for him.  I keep driving that point home.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I got hubby involved in a sort of sneaky way but truly, my eyes were<br/>
&gt; hurting from too much reading off the laptop, so I asked if he could<br/>
&gt; be kind enough to print out the unschooling stuff that I&#39;ve emailed to<br/>
&gt; him. I&#39;ve have snuck in stuffs that I need him to &quot;glance thu&quot; like<br/>

comes up with 9 times 3 is 27, which he learned on Ruff Ruffman.  My husband<br/>
has started to recognize how much information he gains from the shows he<br/>
watches.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This way gave my hubby a glimpse of hwat everyone is doing unschooling<br/>
&gt; wise, and also confidence that I am DOING/ working towards something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I had many opportunity along the way to point out all those<br/>
&gt; fantastic and interesting things that DS did to hubby. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; difficult becuase everything DS did, without any of my intervention or<br/>
&gt; instigation, is surprising and amazing enough to catch our attention.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I&#39;m not talking about doing maths or science experiments or any<br/>
&gt; other scholarly feats.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m talking about my child repeating what he saw on tv to hubby.<br/>

do  you know that?&quot;.  Yesterday, he explained to me how the street sweeper<br/>
works.  He said he figured it out from watching it.  I dont&#39; know for sure,<br/>
but he sure sounds like he understands how it works.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; reminders for us all.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what I mean, stand back, and watching your child unfold his<br/>
trueself to you.<br/>
<br/>
Today, my hubby is a true believer of unschooling. He will talk<br/>
confidently to anyone about unschooling and our child&#39;s amazing self.<br/>
A big change for someone who believed &quot;rules are rules, and need to be<br/>
followed&quot; LOL!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my dh will get there too.  He became quite the homebirth proponent<br/>
after we had our  youngest at home.  A couple of years before, he had said<br/>
&quot;you can have a homebirth and I&#39;ll go to the hospital&quot;.  If you ask him, he<br/>
would just say he would pefere the status quo.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;After 23 months of unschooling, I still get hick-ups here and there<br/>
occasionally. But I understood the problem lies in me, and not my<br/>
child. And it normally starts when I start &quot;expecting something&quot; LOL! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I will have challenges about expectations.  They are pretty deeply<br/>
ingrained that even though I recognize the fallacy, I find myself expecting<br/>
(really wishing).  But if I have fewer expectations of myself, that &quot;should&quot;<br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Very much, Thanks!!!<br/>
