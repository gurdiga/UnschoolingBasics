<div id="ygrps-yiv-863842537">Alright, I don&#39;t know too much about un-schooling but am wondering if <br/>
it is something that might be better suited for my child.  I am <br/>
starting to experience what I think is &quot;homeschool burnout&quot; but I <br/>
don&#39;t know for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I originally took my daughter out of puclic school due to the fact <br/>
that she was sooooo overwhelmed with all the work she has to do at <br/>
school and then all the homework (3-4 hours practically every night), <br/>
and then the stupid stress of studying for the TAKS and feeling <br/>
pressured from the school to get a &quot;good grade&quot; (after all, they need <br/>
every cent they can get and having better scores earns more <br/>
$$)....then there were the kids, the trash talking horrible children <br/>
who taught my daughter MORE than she should be worrying about at this <br/>
point.  Then one of the teachers lied to me about something right in <br/>
front of my daughter with me on the phone and the pricipal had the <br/>
audacity to try and down play her actions....that was the straw that <br/>
broke the camels back.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways I took my daughter out and started with a mesh of homeschool <br/>
products...we found she likes Saxon math through all the different <br/>
trial and errors on products...but that was just about it.  So <br/>
feeling overwhelmed I started talking to another homeschool Mother <br/>
who was using Christian Liberty as her curriculum and explained that <br/>
she had been homeschooled through them also.  I felt suddenly <br/>
inclined to start with them feeling that it was exactly what I needed <br/>
to make our lives more organized.  <br/>
<br/>
When we received the CLASS program I had that sick feeling like it <br/>
was going too be too much already and it has proven to be just that. <br/>
Most of the books are pretty good but we have already had issues with <br/>
the Math program and had to request them switching it from MCP to <br/>
Saxon.  That takes about a month or so just to get one thing <br/>
changed!!  Then you have all the testing to give which I pretty much <br/>
just let her use open book because the questions can be difficult and <br/>
she already has issues with retention and is hard on herself about <br/>
getting good grades.  So then my daughter started to get really upset <br/>
and felt like she was back in public school again because of all the <br/>
work and all the different subjects there are.  I think there is like <br/>
8 or 9.  So we finally decided after lots of tears, that we would cut <br/>
back to just focusing on completing one thing at a time.  I still <br/>
havfe her doing Math everyday, a bible lesson and then only one other <br/>
subject until she finishes the book and takes all the tests.<br/>
<br/>
Well, honestly she still feels stressed and it is killing me.  I have <br/>
a 22m old who is really active and needs my attention every waking <br/>
minute.  I honestly have never been a fan of school and in a perfect <br/>
world I would just rather have my daughter be who she wants to be, <br/>
learn when she wants and what she really wants and dump all the <br/>
rest.  I am not that creative when it comes to schooling or playing <br/>
fot that matter.  I have prayed, cried, prayed, and cried some more <br/>
over what I am doing wrong and to please change my attitude and heart <br/>
towards education.  I DO NOT want to send my daughter back to public <br/>
school because I don&#39;t think that is the answer.<br/>
<br/>
I am at my whits end over what to do.  My daughter is very musically <br/>
inclined, takes piano, played drums, sings beautifully, loves drawing <br/>
and writing....but....when she is asked to these things for school <br/>
such as write a book report or essay...she just loses herself!<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am on the verge of a nervous break-down. I am hoping <br/>
that maybe un-schooling is something that might be to our advantage <br/>
but I need all the information I can get about it.  I don&#39;t have too <br/>
much time during the day or evening to sit and look up too much <br/>
because I am always needed or working or catching up on this messy <br/>
house.  My husband talks about having more kids and at this point I <br/>
would rather poke my own eyes out and light myself on fire!<br/>
<br/>
I love my children dearly....and that is why I am here.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your help<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870144606">Dear Lila<br/>
   <br/>
  I am no expert but I relate to all your frustrations and feelings.  We are in the process of pulling our kids from school.  It has indeed been painful and it seems so difficult to get things right.  I am a teacher and even so feel the frustrations of trying to meet learning needs of my children in just the right way.  My husband and I just finished reading Rue Kream&#39;s book...&quot;Parenting a Free Child&quot;  It is brilliant.  You will have to order it directly from her.  I also found a wonderful website called The Natural Child Project which has been enourmously helpful.  John Holt is a guru and you must read his book &quot;Teach Your Own.&quot;  It is necessary to get support for what you are trying to do as it seems, from my very little experience, that the challenge is in facing what is hard for ourselves.  I am learning to let go and trust my children to lead the way...Donna<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461442579">One of the great things about unschooling  is that there need never be a &#39;typical day&#39;. We are all free to pursue (or not) whatever interests us any time.  We have no schedules. Yesterday the kids wanted to walk across the street to the garden shop that just opened for the season and buy some annual flowers to plant. We wandered through the rows of plants choosing just the right colors of pansies, etc., and then we came home and spent the afternoon selecting just the right locations for our new plants and putting them in the ground.   Some days the children are happy playing together without mommy or daddy joining in...building blocks, plastic animals, dolls, video or computer games, TV,  riding bikes, reading  or whatever imaginary game they are having fun playing that day. Other days they want mommy or daddy to play along with them.  Some days we visit friends for play time, or we go on a field trip to a museum,  an aquarium, or the beach.. <br/>
I enjoy my own interests too-  crafting, gardening, reading, etc., - sometimes the children join me in doing these things and sometimes they do their own thing. We talk, we laugh, we explore, and enjoy life.  Its amazing how many interesting conversations we get into that start with &#39; Hey mom, guess what happened on Sponge Bob Square pants today??&quot;   I notice the things my children are interested in.  Sometimes they are interested for a long time (weeks, months, or years), sometimes just for a hour or a day.  I help them explore their interests if they want me to by answering questions, offerering books, field trips.  I might just mention a fun field trip- sometimes they take me up on the idea, other times not.  We can go to the library for books, or the book store, or look things up on the internet.  My older son has spent many hours researching everything from prehistoric creatures, to automobiles, to the latest Pokemon characters on the internet. Because he wants to not because <br/>
he has to.   My other son who is interested in home design found a great internet based program for designing and decorating homes.   The point is that we are free to live life and pursue our interests regardless of whether they look like &#39;school&#39; or not. All sorts of learning happens whether we try or not.. I hope this helps.  Good luck!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506059147">Alright, I don&#39;t know too much about un-schooling but am wondering if <br/>
it is something that might be better suited for my child.<br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] <br/>
<br/>
I would suggest you spend some time reading the yahoo groups.  Just listen<br/>
for a while - most of your questions will be answered within a few weeks.<br/>
Pick up a book on unschooling and carry it with you wherever you go.  You<br/>
can read snippets at a time.  I used to print long postings from my favorite<br/>
posters to read while on the road when I didn&#39;t have time at home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, honestly she still feels stressed and it is killing me. <br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] Sounds like she&#39;s experiencing homeschool burnout as well.<br/>
<br/>
I have <br/>
a 22m old who is really active and needs my attention every waking <br/>
minute.<br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] Sounds fairly normal to me.<br/>
<br/>
 I honestly have never been a fan of school and in a perfect <br/>
world I would just rather have my daughter be who she wants to be, <br/>
learn when she wants and what she really wants and dump all the <br/>
rest.<br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] Well you&#39;re looking in the right place.  Unschooling allows<br/>
our children to follow their own path and flourish as themselves.<br/>
<br/>
 I am not that creative when it comes to schooling or playing <br/>
fot that matter.<br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] Forget the word creative.you just have to be responsive to<br/>
your children and help them find the resources to pursue their interests.<br/>
If the word creative intimidates you (at this time)  think of your role more<br/>
as a problem solving.  If you reset the wording in your mind you may find it<br/>
easier to recognize you&#39;ve been focusing your attention all along on finding<br/>
better solutions that work for your daughter (&lt;g&gt; this is creativity at its<br/>
very best).<br/>
<br/>
 I have prayed, cried, prayed, and cried some more <br/>
over what I am doing wrong and to please change my attitude and heart <br/>
towards education. I DO NOT want to send my daughter back to public <br/>
school because I don&#39;t think that is the answer.<br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] Sounds like you&#39;ve already got the right attitude towards<br/>
&#39;educating&#39; your daughter to qualify as an unschooler!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am at my whits end over what to do. My daughter is very musically <br/>
inclined, takes piano, played drums, sings beautifully, loves drawing <br/>
and writing....but....when she is asked to these things for school <br/>
such as write a book report or essay...she just loses herself!<br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] I would suggest you do nothing more right now than et her do<br/>
what she loves..music.  While you relax and read more about real life<br/>
unschooling.  Get Rue Kreams book Parenting a Free Child.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am on the verge of a nervous break-down. I am hoping <br/>
that maybe un-schooling is something that might be to our advantage <br/>
but I need all the information I can get about it. I don&#39;t have too <br/>
much time during the day or evening to sit and look up too much <br/>
because I am always needed or working or catching up on this messy <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] Well that is a reality of homeschooling/unschooling.  With<br/>
unschooling  you will shift your perspective on time.  It doesn&#39;t mean your<br/>
house will be any less messier.  How old is your dd?  The messy house is a<br/>
reality of living at home with young children.  There are days when I do<br/>
feel like all I&#39;m doing is picking up after everyone.  When I find myself<br/>
overwhelmed or resentful of this - I stop doing it for the moment.  The mess<br/>
will be there later.  Sometimes I need to leave the house.  I only do it<br/>
when I want to.that is one of the lessons of unschooling myself as well as<br/>
my kids. If its not fun - we don&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
 My husband talks about having more kids and at this point I <br/>
would rather poke my own eyes out and light myself on fire!<br/>
<br/>
[Lisa Heyman] You have a child under 2.  It took me 7 years after my second<br/>
daughter was born before I would consider a third child.  How old are you<br/>
and your husband?  What&#39;s the rush?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love my children dearly....and that is why I am here.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your help<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877024978">First off, testing is NOT required if you live in Texas. Once your child<br/>
is out, that&#39;s it. You are considered a private school, I believe, in<br/>
Texas - the public school district no longer has jurisdiction. So, if<br/>
the testing and drilling are killing you, STOP. NOW. Take a LONG<br/>
vacation. Give it a *minimum* of one month for every year of<br/>
school/school at home - that applies to the grownups too. That&#39;s the<br/>
minimum of how long it takes to &#39;detox&#39; - yes, it takes time to get<br/>
school out of your system just like any other &quot;allergen&quot; or whatever and<br/>
start feeling whole and &quot;healthy&quot; again.<br/>
 <br/>
What does it look like in real life? Real Life. For someone who loves<br/>
music, it&#39;s full of music. For someone who loves drawing and painting,<br/>
it&#39;s full of drawing and painting. For someone who loves to read, it&#39;s a<br/>
sea of books. For my DS (he&#39;s just shy of 9 and never been schooled), it<br/>
looks like lots of videogames and building with various things and being<br/>
very active. Tidbits of our days the last couple of days:<br/>
 <br/>
Saturday: DS and I went to the co-op to shop for the week&#39;s groceries.<br/>
They stayed home and played/relaxed while I went to a bridal shower for<br/>
a friend&#39;s daughter. After I got home, we played a bit with vinegar and<br/>
baking soda and decided to move the action out to the back yard so we<br/>
could be a bit more &quot;explosive&quot; with things (try using a sealed<br/>
container for the reaction - blows the lid clean off!) DH went back in<br/>
to finish up the dinner dishes and DS and I gathered some small bits of<br/>
kindling and not-too-big bits of branch that had blown down in the<br/>
recent rain storm/nor&#39;easter and piled them in the fire ring in the<br/>
yard. Then we hauled out the plastic lawn furniture benches and DH came<br/>
out and we had a nice campfire and watched the dusk deepen to twilight<br/>
and spotted the first bat of the season (YEAH BATS! They eat the<br/>
mosquitoes).<br/>
 <br/>
Sunday: got up and went to church. DS and I inventoried the food pantry<br/>
supplies and made a list of what is running low so that can get<br/>
published and distributed. Then, after Bible classes, he helped me in<br/>
the nursery (it was my turn). He helped me keep things somewhat tidy -<br/>
we only had one toddler that day, so when he noticed she&#39;d stopped<br/>
playing with something and was two things down the road from it, he&#39;d<br/>
put it away. He played with her, played some on his own. Helped her find<br/>
her mom afterward while I did the last little bit of tidying. He played<br/>
outside some for a bit, then we headed out - it was a BIG day Sunday,<br/>
Pokemon Pearl and Diamond were released for the Nintendo DS. So we<br/>
picked up our reserved copies and went to Boston Market for lunch. DH<br/>
and DS played on their games while I cleaned the kitchen. Which was<br/>
actually more than I intended to do. I wanted to make some custom soaps<br/>
for my nephews and nieces (I promised them more a few months ago). That<br/>
required cleaning off the whole table space. Once the table was clean,<br/>
all the crumbs and such that had fallen to the floor needed to be swept<br/>
up BUT there was stuff that needed to be dealt with before I could<br/>
sweep. That in turn led to re-organizing the island and other surface<br/>
areas. And so on until the whole room was done - DH asked me with<br/>
humorous concern if I was &quot;nesting&quot; (no, I&#39;m not pregnant!! It&#39;s just<br/>
his way of saying Wow that was a lot of work I didn&#39;t expect all that to<br/>
get done in one lump). Then I got down to soap.<br/>
 <br/>
A tidbit from a discussion with a friend that might be helpful: She said<br/>
it was great that we had all these learning experiences for DS. I told<br/>
her we don&#39;t think of them as learning experiences, we just do what<br/>
looks like fun.<br/>
 <br/>
Monday: I headed off to work. My guys (DH is the at home parent) got up,<br/>
played more on their games. Ate breakfast somewhere in there. Went to<br/>
Burger King for lunch then headed off to a park day with our unschooling<br/>
group. DS met up with one of his buddies in the group and played for a<br/>
couple hours. Then they decided that they needed to get together more,<br/>
so they asked their respective parents to set up some time when they can<br/>
get together. That&#39;s in the works. They played more after dinner while I<br/>
experimented with some different soap techniques. DH discovered that the<br/>
&quot;Global Trade&quot; feature of the game is literally global - you can trade<br/>
(through wi-fi/Internet connection) with people all over, he traded with<br/>
someone in Japan! <br/>
 <br/>
Tuesday: they&#39;re playing, I&#39;m at work. Tonight after dinner we&#39;re going<br/>
to the food co-op to work for a couple hours (co-ops run very much on<br/>
volunteers, and in this case we get a discount on our purchases for<br/>
putting in x amount of hours in a month). <br/>
 <br/>
In all respects your household will probably look vastly different in<br/>
the specifics. However, the overall &quot;tone&quot; of unschooling is one of<br/>
trust, respect, each person following their passions and ideas,<br/>
cooperating to get the best for everyone as much as possible (given<br/>
limitations of budget and time and such). Gee, think of all the money<br/>
saved when it&#39;s not going for school supplies and clothing or expensive<br/>
packaged curriculum.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds like your dd knows how to learn and enjoy learning but all <br/>
this school stuff keeps getting in her way. That&#39;s true of most <br/>
kids, until school snuffs the love of learning out of them. At least <br/>
your dd&#39;s interests are still alive and well. <br/>
<br/>
For now, declare your &quot;school year&quot; over as far as your dd is <br/>
concerned and spend some of the time you had been using for <br/>
homeschool to learn about alternatives. Spend the rest getting to <br/>
know your dd and becoming a stronger family. Tell your husband and <br/>
any nosy busybodies that what you were doing wasn&#39;t working so <br/>
you&#39;re taking time out to do research.<br/>
<br/>
And by all means, research unschooling! Its all about helping your <br/>
kids learn in ways they are best suited for - really learn, not be <br/>
able to parrot back gibberish for a test. It often takes parents <br/>
awhile to understand how their kids learn and how to best facilitate <br/>
that, though.<br/>
<br/>
You will want to look at the local laws to find out what you can get <br/>
away with in terms of reporting - check the links section to see if <br/>
there&#39;s an unschooling group in your state that can help you with <br/>
the details. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100322064">Unschooling is the philosophy that at its core has the belief that learning <br/>
happens all the time and that teaching will usually place a damper on a <br/>
child&#39;s natural joy in learning and exploring the world. Not only will <br/>
teaching hamper learning it will often bring a person to the belief that <br/>
learning is difficult and if you fail at learning what is being taught you <br/>
are stupid.<br/>
<br/>
You say: &quot;I honestly have never been a fan of school and in a perfect world <br/>
I would just rather have my daughter be who she wants to be, learn when she <br/>
wants and what she really wants and dump all the rest. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
So do it. quit the CLASS program. Just walk away from it. Tell your daughter <br/>
you are going to take a break from the curriculum stuff and sit back and <br/>
have a rethink. And then watch her. Watch her play piano or play drums or <br/>
write or play runescape on the computer or just hang out and watch ants <br/>
carrying the bread that she breaks near their anthill back to feed their <br/>
queen. Watch how she learns from everything and from everywhere. Don&#39;t worry <br/>
about TAKS (which, if you are in Texas, isn&#39;t required, nor are ny other <br/>
standardized tests required of homeschoolers), don&#39;t worry about how she <br/>
would compare with her schooled peers, just be with your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in an old journal I have a list of what Simon and Linnaea did in a <br/>
particular day for a few days and the range of learning was absolutely <br/>
amazing. From the conversations during Fairly Odd Parents to discovering <br/>
about ladybug parasites to whatever else was going on in those few days. <br/>
Maybe, after a few days with no curriculum you could try that. Just for a <br/>
little while take notes on what your daughter is doing. Pay attention to <br/>
what you talk about, what you look up on google with her, what you sing in <br/>
the car, what connections she makes and you make. And then let it go, and <br/>
just live and learn.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve already decided that the curriculum isn&#39;t working. You are already <br/>
cheating at it and it is clearly negatively affecting your daughter&#39;s self <br/>
esteem:<br/>
&quot;Then you have all the testing to give which I pretty much just let her use <br/>
open book because the questions can be difficult and she already has issues <br/>
with retention and is hard on herself about getting good grades.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And when you get a chance read and print out pieces from here to read when <br/>
you get a chance: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>

There is a huge amount on those two sites alone, lots of stories and advice. <br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Is un-schooling for us? Need help ASAP!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Alright, I don&#39;t know too much about un-schooling but am wondering if<br/>
&gt; it is something that might be better suited for my child.  I am<br/>
&gt; starting to experience what I think is &quot;homeschool burnout&quot; but I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know for sure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I originally took my daughter out of puclic school due to the fact<br/>
&gt; that she was sooooo overwhelmed with all the work she has to do at<br/>
&gt; school and then all the homework (3-4 hours practically every night),<br/>
&gt; and then the stupid stress of studying for the TAKS and feeling<br/>
&gt; pressured from the school to get a &quot;good grade&quot; (after all, they need<br/>
&gt; every cent they can get and having better scores earns more<br/>
&gt; $$)....then there were the kids, the trash talking horrible children<br/>
&gt; who taught my daughter MORE than she should be worrying about at this<br/>
&gt; point.  Then one of the teachers lied to me about something right in<br/>
&gt; front of my daughter with me on the phone and the pricipal had the<br/>
&gt; audacity to try and down play her actions....that was the straw that<br/>
&gt; broke the camels back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyways I took my daughter out and started with a mesh of homeschool<br/>
&gt; products...we found she likes Saxon math through all the different<br/>
&gt; trial and errors on products...but that was just about it.  So<br/>
&gt; feeling overwhelmed I started talking to another homeschool Mother<br/>
&gt; who was using Christian Liberty as her curriculum and explained that<br/>
&gt; she had been homeschooled through them also.  I felt suddenly<br/>
&gt; inclined to start with them feeling that it was exactly what I needed<br/>
&gt; to make our lives more organized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When we received the CLASS program I had that sick feeling like it<br/>
&gt; was going too be too much already and it has proven to be just that.<br/>
&gt; Most of the books are pretty good but we have already had issues with<br/>
&gt; the Math program and had to request them switching it from MCP to<br/>
&gt; Saxon.  That takes about a month or so just to get one thing<br/>
&gt; changed!!  Then you have all the testing to give which I pretty much<br/>
&gt; just let her use open book because the questions can be difficult and<br/>
&gt; she already has issues with retention and is hard on herself about<br/>
&gt; getting good grades.  So then my daughter started to get really upset<br/>
&gt; and felt like she was back in public school again because of all the<br/>
&gt; work and all the different subjects there are.  I think there is like<br/>
&gt; 8 or 9.  So we finally decided after lots of tears, that we would cut<br/>
&gt; back to just focusing on completing one thing at a time.  I still<br/>
&gt; havfe her doing Math everyday, a bible lesson and then only one other<br/>
&gt; subject until she finishes the book and takes all the tests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, honestly she still feels stressed and it is killing me.  I have<br/>
&gt; a 22m old who is really active and needs my attention every waking<br/>
&gt; minute.  I honestly have never been a fan of school and in a perfect<br/>
&gt; world I would just rather have my daughter be who she wants to be,<br/>
&gt; learn when she wants and what she really wants and dump all the<br/>
&gt; rest.  I am not that creative when it comes to schooling or playing<br/>
&gt; fot that matter.  I have prayed, cried, prayed, and cried some more<br/>
&gt; over what I am doing wrong and to please change my attitude and heart<br/>
&gt; towards education.  I DO NOT want to send my daughter back to public<br/>
&gt; school because I don&#39;t think that is the answer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am at my whits end over what to do.  My daughter is very musically<br/>
&gt; inclined, takes piano, played drums, sings beautifully, loves drawing<br/>
&gt; and writing....but....when she is asked to these things for school<br/>
&gt; such as write a book report or essay...she just loses herself!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I feel like I am on the verge of a nervous break-down. I am hoping<br/>
&gt; that maybe un-schooling is something that might be to our advantage<br/>
&gt; but I need all the information I can get about it.  I don&#39;t have too<br/>
&gt; much time during the day or evening to sit and look up too much<br/>
&gt; because I am always needed or working or catching up on this messy<br/>
&gt; house.  My husband talks about having more kids and at this point I<br/>
&gt; would rather poke my own eyes out and light myself on fire!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I love my children dearly....and that is why I am here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you for your help<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609417930">Hi Brittany,<br/>
   <br/>
  There are so many things different people consider unschooling and it looks so different for different families. This list is to help you embrace radical unschooling ( someone correct me if Im wrong on that ) Im far from an expert on this ...just pulled dd 7 from school a month  ago.....but thats why I read here. <br/>
   <br/>
  Yesterday my daughter went to the bathroom and yells mom where is taiwan ? I was a bit boggled by this sudden question ...honestly i didnt even think she had heard of Taiwan. Turns out she picked up the plunger and read made in Taiwan on it. I showed her on a map then we ended up spending about an hour on the net looking at traditional clothing, foods and such . <br/>
   <br/>
  Right this minute she and my 4 year old daughter are building a castle for the &quot;trash diggers&quot;( what she calls people in our area that look through trash cans for cans to sell and food) and I hear her saying welcome to the castle we have books and bean bags in here , and here is the snack room......my mommy will cook you dinner but you can come here and eat anytime you are hungry and if you dont like whats for dinner just come here and get some food. Unfortunatly she has know being 2 days away from homeless and only having ramen and beans in the pantry but just like everything else that is a part of her life good or bad....she learns from it. <br/>
   <br/>
  She refuses to read right now but wants me to read to her a lot. This eve well read more of what the moom saw . Not wanting to read dosent surprise me . At school she was not allowed to draw when finished with work and they were only allowed to read books So of course now she draws for hours.:) <br/>
   <br/>
  I have to 3rd...4th 5th? lol the reccomendation of declaring school over for the year. Unless you do everything possible to prevent learning...as most schools do imho.....no matter what she does she will learn . <br/>
   <br/>
  So relax...check out www.sandradod.com and unschooling.com and others may have links also. <br/>
   <br/>
  Can I e-mail you privately? I have some christian specific links that may intrest you ( the reason i asked if you were christian :) )<br/>

many religions (and lack-of) are represented here. We just don&#39;t talk <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Im sorry I really didnt mean to offend anyone with that question. It was meant for the OP . Reading her post it seemed like she was. Ok Im horrible with words but Ill try to explain.<br/>
  Many churches teach a way of thnking about raising chldren and life in general that really hinders one from moving to unschooling. <br/>
  There is a book and Ive found a few websites that have a biblical perspective yet help you look at things from a different angle and bring yourself closer to unschooling. They helped me change my thinking and I thought maybe they would be useful to her.<br/>
   <br/>
  So in another post I asked if I could send her some stuff offlist  :)<br/>

the link so you can see the photo I refer to in the post.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, my daughter is eight years old, the youngest of my <br/>
three. She&#39;s been radically unschooled since she was six, we adopted <br/>
her at five and she spent a year and a half in public school <br/>
(kindergarten through half of first grade). <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I almost feel like it&#39;s my duty, as an unschooling mom to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>share moments like this because I read so such CRAP online about how <br/>
you can&#39;t trust kids to make their own choices. That if a child <br/>
chooses their own food, they&#39;ll eat gummy bears and chips everyday, <br/>
ALL DAY LONG. That if a child has computer freedom, they&#39;ll either <br/>
be playing games all day or visiting porno sites.<br/>
<br/>
Bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
I have living, breathing proof in my house that it&#39;s not true.<br/>
<br/>
Jacqueline gets up before I do most mornings and she helps herself <br/>
to a light breakfast and then decides what she wants to do. Mostly <br/>
she&#39;ll watch a movie (she&#39;s big into Star Wars right now), work on a <br/>
story she&#39;s writing (it&#39;s her third) or play Barbies.<br/>
<br/>
I woke up the other morning and started making my morning tea. <br/>
Jacqueline yelled good morning from the family room and I asked her <br/>
what she was doing. She replied that she was playing on the <br/>
computer. Being she said &#39;playing&#39;, I thought she was on one of our <br/>
games like Sim City 3000 or Lilo & Stitch which of course would have <br/>
been perfectly fine.<br/>
<br/>
But there she was, having fun with the scientific calculator that&#39;s <br/>
on the computer. The same scientific calculator that I didn&#39;t even <br/>
know existed until I saw her on it. In her world, playing around <br/>
with algebra, calculus and the table of elements is fun.<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;ll notice in the picture, the breakfast she got for herself-<br/>
a banana and a low fat smoothie.<br/>
<br/>
Let me make something clear....I don&#39;t think the table of elements <br/>
is any more valuable than that Sim City game. In unschooling, <br/>
everything has value and is important. <br/>
<br/>
I bring up these moments to silence the critics who think that <br/>
unschooled children will never have an interest in learning anything <br/>
unless they&#39;re being told to or that children cannot be trusted to <br/>
make their own choices. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s where mindful parenting comes into play. Jacqueline is not <br/>
left alone to figure out things on her own. I&#39;m there, as her <br/>
partner, her guide. I take my job as an unschooling parent seriously <br/>
and I pour a lot of time, attention and respect into her. Frankly, <br/>
it&#39;s not for everyone...I know plenty of parents who never want to <br/>
spend more time than they have to with their kids.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

  You need to make that time to do the research. You need to make that <br/>
time to be with your children.<br/>
<br/>
  We ALL have the same number of hours in the day. Where do you spend <br/>
it? Cleaning and helping with schoolwork?<br/>
<br/>
  Quit doing school NOW. RIGHT NOW. RIGHT THIS MINUTE. Go play! Let your <br/>
daughter sing and play her instruments. Let her draw and help you with <br/>
the dishes (if she wants to!)<br/>
<br/>
  Honestly, the house can wait. Schoolwork is now nonexistent. So PLAY. <br/>
While she&#39;s engaged in something, look online at www.sandradodd.com or <br/>
www.joyfullyrejoycing.com  Order Rue&#39;s book, Parenting a Free Child, an <br/>
Unschooled Life (www.freechild.org)---you can read it in the bathroom <br/>
or while in line at the bank---EASY read!<br/>
<br/>
When she needs you, BE there *completely*, not half-way---like making <br/>
lists in your head whle you play Chutes and Ladders. PLAY Chutes and <br/>
Ladders! Right now you are doing everything BUT being there for and <br/>
*with* your children.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling may be for you, but you do need to learn about it and be <br/>
willing to stop nagging and to allow your children to be Who They Are.<br/>

definition of it but what it really looks like for most people. Anyone <br/>
care to<br/>

many religions (and lack-of) are represented here. We just don&#39;t talk <br/>
about it unless it directly impacts unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There IS a Radical Christian Unschoolers list (is it owned by Susan <br/>
McGlohn???). You&#39;ll find it by googling all three words. I&#39;m *guessing* <br/>
that it&#39;s RadChristianUnschoolers@yahoo....???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  and I see TAKS..........are you in texas? if so hi neighbor! lol<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The OP was/is. But this list is international.<br/>

   Im sorry I really didnt mean to offend anyone with that question. It <br/>
was meant<br/>
for the OP .<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I know. No one was offended. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   Many churches teach a way of thnking about raising chldren and life <br/>
in general<br/>
that really hinders one from moving to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We know all about it!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why many on this list have left the church. When you start to <br/>
question ONE thing,....<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   There is a book and Ive found a few websites that have a biblical <br/>
perspective<br/>
yet help you look at things from a different angle and bring yourself <br/>
closer to<br/>
unschooling. They helped me change my thinking and I thought maybe they <br/>
would be<br/>
useful to her.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Look into the RadChristianUnschoolers (I&#39;m *really* sure that&#39;s the <br/>
yahoogroup). Susan McGlohn is an active Christian Unschooling mom. <br/>
She&#39;d have all the books and website for any of you interested.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  So in another post I asked if I could send her some stuff offlist<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---I saw. &lt;g&gt; As list-owner, I just *have* to put my two cents in <br/>
though! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

I&#39;ll be posting pictures later of him getting his hair done by <br/>

hair. LOL <br/>

directly on the list with a comment like the one above. Not only may <br/>
such resources be useful to other Christians on the list, but <br/>
unschoolers who would like to open up relationships with Christian <br/>
family members might find them helpful - heck *I* might check them out <br/>
for that reason.  <br/>
<br/>
Posting a link is actually less intrusive to the list as a whole than <br/>
starting a private conversation onlist. I ignore dozens of links and <br/>
book recommendations weekly ;) <br/>
