<div id="ygrps-yiv-693688438">Hi!<br/>
  I have two sons 6 and 4. Are there any unschoolers in the St. Louis area that would like to connect?  I love reading the posts but find it difficult to put into words my questions and to describe my situation and would like to get together with people who are choosing the same learning journey.<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-474537012">We just had the L&L conference in Fairview Heights, IL one year ago! <br/>
You missed it! We went as a group to the City Museum and everything!<br/>
<br/>
  There were several unschoolers from the immediate area---St Louis and <br/>
SW Illinois. I&#39;d suggest googling &quot;unschoolers St Louis Illinois&quot; and <br/>
see what pops up. I know there is at least one group there.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have that site that lists homeschoolers from everywhere? <br/>
That would be an idea too.<br/>

  I have two sons 6 and 4. Are there any unschoolers in the St. Louis <br/>
area that<br/>
  would like to connect? I love reading the posts but find it difficult <br/>
to put<br/>

Try www.nhen.org, they list homeschool (though not specifically <br/>
unschool) groups by state.<br/>

There&#39;s a folder at unschooling.info specifically for contacting<br/>
unschoolers from all different places. There is also a great locater<br/>
at homeschoolmedia.com and nhen.org.<br/>

<br/>
Anyone else in MA?  (I sent a few messages to those who put they were <br/>
unschoolers in MA in my area - are you here?   Don&#39;t know if they go <br/>
to individual email addresses, or just on the site....)<br/>
