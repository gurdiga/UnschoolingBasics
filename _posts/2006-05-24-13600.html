Your response to Tonya is AWESOME!  I LOVED that balloon analogy that you used.  It is one that I will apply to the fears that I have left in unschooling AND my own personal life.  Also, the point on choices is dead on right!  That is one of the most valuable lessons one can learn.  And I believe that unschooling will help our children realize that they have choices and make that a natural way of being rather than having it to learn after the fact.<br/>
<br/>
And I am finally getting a huge message regarding discussion versus support groups.  I have an obsessive compulsive disorder called trichotillomania.  Essentially, I am a hair puller.  I have CHOSEN to move past this disorder and have been struggling with the *support* groups for those of us with this behavior.  On the lists that I am on it seems that people want to talk about how difficult it is to move past it and that is it.  I joined because I have decided that this can no longer be a part of my life.  I had not yet addressed my issue to these groups because I did not want to sound judgmental.  I can respect where everyone is but I am no longer where they are. I am choosing to make this something that I used to do.  I now see that I need to start a DISCUSSION list for people who are on fire and ready to move past this OCD.  All of the recent talk about support vs discussion group has finally sunken in!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Joyce and Everyone really.  I call this group my fire. You help to light the fire or keep the fire lit within that keeps me moving toward being a better person and hence a better mother.<br/>
<br/>
One Love and Peace<br/>

  But I think a better way to look at the list is to picture everyone  <br/>
  with a dozen practices they&#39;re holding onto that make their own life  <br/>
  easier and less fearful. The practices are like balloons that support  <br/>
  their fears because their fears are threatening to pull them into a  <br/>
  bottomless abyss. They *want* to hold onto the balloons and they  <br/>
  can&#39;t understand why people find it so easy to let go.<br/>
