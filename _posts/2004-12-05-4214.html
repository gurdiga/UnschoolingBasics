<div id="ygrps-yiv-913713132">Hi all. My name is Jeff. I am 37 years old, married 3 years to my <br/>
wife Jane, who is 27 years old.  We have a 2-week-old daughter named <br/>
Bree. We are strongly considering home schooling/unschooling for <br/>
many, widely varied, reasons. Since she is so young, we&#39;d like to be <br/>
able to &quot;get our ducks in a row&quot; before she is &quot;supposed&quot; to start <br/>
school, and to ensure that we don&#39;t make fatal errors in judgment <br/>
that will cause later problems.<br/>
<br/>
For background, let me tell you a little about our family. My wife <br/>
and I are both products of the public education system; in fact, my <br/>
wife went through the school system in the county where we now <br/>
reside. We both HATED &quot;school&quot;: I did well, however, and went on to <br/>
a bachelor&#39;s degree. My wife didn&#39;t do so well in school, dropping <br/>
out in her senior year and took a GED. I love to read for pleasure, <br/>
Jane can barely stand to read a magazine article or a cookbook <br/>
recipe. Emails and/or something she really wants to know are her <br/>
limits. (She can read well; to the college level - she just doesn&#39;t <br/>
like to.) I am firmly of the opinion that most of the things I know <br/>
of lasting value, were all learned independently; outside the <br/>
traditional educational system, and that learning is an unending <br/>
process. We are already convinced that public education generally, <br/>
and our county school system particularly, is no place for our <br/>
darling Bree.<br/>
<br/>
We are Christians, but not of the fundamentalist/born-again stripe. <br/>
We are generally politically conservative, but we both have a good <br/>
mix of liberal beliefs thrown in. I am the high-speed, low-drag, <br/>
uber-organized type; Jane is the start-slow and taper off type, <br/>
believing that most things take care of themselves. All in all, I&#39;d <br/>
like to think we are just average folks.  My sister is a Montessori <br/>
teacher, so we have some knowledge of non-traditional educational <br/>
models; AND their better than average results. My parents are <br/>
comfortable with non-traditional methods; hers are the Ozzie and <br/>
Harriet types right out of the 1950&#39;s - we can expect SERIOUS <br/>
opposition from them if we don&#39;t stick Bree in the local elementary <br/>
school/daycare depot, have bedtimes, or allow her to eat <br/>
whatever/whenever she wants.<br/>
<br/>
Several questions to you experienced unschoolers out there. First, <br/>
where does one start? How do we &quot;teach&quot; the basic fundamentals? By <br/>
that I mean, beyond-bedtime-story reading, spelling, writing, and <br/>
basic arithmetic. My state requires a yearly written assessment of <br/>
Reading, Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies, and <br/>
standardized testing every three years starting at the end of third <br/>
grade.  How does the unschooling model conform to these <br/>
requirements?  What  do we say to Jane&#39;s parents when they pitch the <br/>
inevitable fit? If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, <br/>
how do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>
achievement?<br/>
<br/>
Our goal is a healthy, happy, well-adjusted daughter, unlimited in <br/>
her future prospects - while keeping Mom and Dad out of jail for <br/>
failing to follow the rules.  Any advice, resources, etc. that you <br/>
folks can recommend would be gratefully received.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942436208">Hi Jeff,<br/>
Congratulations on your new little baby!  <br/>
It is good that you are learning about unschooling so early; this philosophy encompasses your (and your child&#39;s) whole life, and it will be a wonderful gift to her to have complete freedom from birth!  Regarding your question about how to &quot;teach&quot; her the fundamentals, let me assure you that unschooling works.  You will soon see your dd&#39;s innate drive to learn and its strength.  Trust it.  She will learn everything that she needs to learn.  You will be able to help her by answering her questions, showing her how to seek answers on her own.  You will not ever need to introduce her to topics for which she hasn&#39;t expressed an interest.  If you haven&#39;t devoured Sandra Dodd&#39;s site yet, I encourage you to do so, and I am sure many others will do the same.  The beauty of unschooling is that you relax and trust that learning is inevitable.  My own ds, always unschooled, is not yet three, and he is already entirely literate, reading well, nearly as fast as I do and including extremely long or<br/>
 difficult words...he also has broad knowledge in diverse fields:  I would go so far as to call him an expert on the Solar System, rocks and minerals, and mushrooms; and he is intimate w maps on all levels from the geological survey of our immediate area to the map of the world and can id most of the US states and over half of the countries of the world.  He is computer literate as well.  This is all from following his own interests and having his questions answered (from the time he could point at everything and only say &quot;Dis?&quot;), and I assure you I have never once sat him down and said &quot;Okay, son, let&#39;s learn about x now.&quot;    My only part in this, aside from as I said, answering many questions, has been reading to him whenever he desired.  I have also done some strewing; I purchased the Children&#39;s World Atlas after I noticed him studying a map in a waiting area, and have made other such purchases...he is always welcome to do what he likes with these materials (and he does choose to<br/>
 study them).  But it is important for me to not value his reading the atlas, say, over playing on the computer, or watching TV, as there is tremendous value and learning opportunities in every aspect of life.<br/>
   Jeff, I would like to advise you to not concern yourself much with your state laws at this point.  I understand why you are concerned and interested, and I myself felt this way.  But there are several years before your child is of compulsary school age, and in that time these standards needn&#39;t concern you at all (and then of course there are many years beyond that before she would be &quot;3rd grade&quot; age).  The thing is, states&#39; laws change.  Homeschooling is becoming more and more widespread and accepted and you may find that the laws in your state are totally different once your child reaches that age.  You will be able to unschool your daughter wherever you live and you will be able to figure out the best way to deal w your state when that time comes.  When I started researching states laws I didn&#39;t know that I would be living in a different state now (so all that research was really pointless).  But, I did happen to research the laws of the state where I now reside, as it was<br/>
 bordering my own.  At that time, in this state (MS), the laws stated that to homeschool your children you needed to be a certified tutor and submit all sorts of records and logs, etc.  Now (less than 3 years later) this state has one of the most relaxed homeschooling laws and all a parent must do is send in a note once a year stating the children&#39;s names and that they will homeschool.<br/>
Anyway, Jeff, enjoy your daughter and be amazed as you watch her learn every day of her life.  You don&#39;t have to teach her; your job is to protect her freedom and allow the relaxed environment where learning comes easily.<br/>
Good luck on your journey together!<br/>
Millie<br/>

<br/>
Hi Jeff, welcome and congratulations.<br/>
<br/>
I would heartily endorse everything that Millie said, and I just want to<br/>
pass on a couple of website addresses. Just breathe and relax. You have time<br/>
to do all this reading. <br/>
<br/>
The main key is just watching your wondrous dd and staying in the moment,<br/>
letting go of any agendas, and avoiding (if you can) getting caught up in<br/>
looking for future outcomes. Most parents, especially ones who have made<br/>
their way here, don&#39;t usually make &quot;fatal errors in judgment&quot;, just ordinary<br/>
human errors and an apology and striving to do better next time work<br/>
wonders. Children are so forgiving and wise. They show us what they need if<br/>
we only listen and watch.<br/>
<br/>
For some general attachment/mindful parenting concepts:<br/>
www.naturalchild.org (lots of short articles that might appeal to dw)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Aware Baby&quot; by Aletha Solter is a book that may stretch your concept of<br/>
what a baby is mentally or emotionally capable of communicating,<br/>
particularly the concept of different types of crying.<br/>

www.unschooling.info/forum<br/>
<br/>
Also the archives on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Some oft recommended books about education, learning and schools:<br/>
<br/>
Anything (everything!) by John Holt - get the most recent editions with his<br/>
final annotations.<br/>
&quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; by Mary Griffith<br/>
&quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; by Alfie Kohn ( www.alfiekohn.org ) <br/>
&quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot; and others by John Taylor Gatto - especially good to rock<br/>
the thinking of in-laws who think schools are all that.<br/>
&quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting&quot; by ?? (I forget)<br/>
&quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; by Valerie Fitzenreiter<br/>
<br/>
There are more at Sandra&#39;s site and that others will suggest too. Sandra has<br/>
some links to non-spanking Christian websites also.<br/>
<br/>
You may also enjoy the following lists:<br/>
<br/>
Always Unschooled is for the parents of &quot;pre-school&quot; age children.<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/<br/>
<br/>
These are the two Unschooling discussion groups for men that my dh is<br/>
subscribed to. They are not hugely busy but he enjoys them.<br/>

<br/>
Finally, although I urge you to put any thoughts about the law on to the<br/>
back burner for now, this website has all the State laws, and contact<br/>
information for local groups and organizations. In a little while you may<br/>
want to join a local inclusive or unschooling support group that has play<br/>
dates and park days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252536381">Thanks for your reply, Millie.<br/>
<br/>
What an amazing son you have! Congratulations.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the very sound advice. I have seen Sandra Dodd&#39;s site, <br/>
but haven&#39;t gone through it all... yet!<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping that the unschooling model will be a benefit to the <br/>
whole family. I hope to learn to let go of some of my super-<br/>
organized tendencies, my wife will learn that &quot;learning&quot; IS fun, and <br/>
that my baby girl learns all she needs to know without the drudgery <br/>
and pressure that her mom and I had.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-909982630">***Since she is so young, we&#39;d like to be <br/>
able to &quot;get our ducks in a row&quot; before she is &quot;supposed&quot; to start <br/>
school, and to ensure that we don&#39;t make fatal errors in judgment <br/>
that will cause later problems.***<br/>
<br/>
Everything seems so urgent when you have a brand new baby.   Your sense<br/>
of responsibility is overwhelmed with the realization there is a life<br/>
depending on the decisions you make.  I felt just like you when my son<br/>
Dylan was born.  It seems like there isn&#39;t enough time to get everything<br/>
right. <br/>
<br/>
The good news is you do have time.  The bad news is you won&#39;t get<br/>
everything right.&lt;g&gt;  But even the bad news isn&#39;t all bad because in your<br/>
mistakes you&#39;ll be learning something about yourself and your daughter<br/>
and you&#39;ll do better the next time.   So my first advice to you is to<br/>
relax and enjoy your new baby.  <br/>
<br/>
***First, where does one start?***<br/>
<br/>
Start by assuming everything is all right.  Trust your daughter as a<br/>
human being will want to do what humans do.   Be loving, generous with<br/>
your time, be willing to participate in her world.  Accept that she is<br/>
and will be her own person and doesn&#39;t need to be shaped or molded by you<br/>
or society.  <br/>
<br/>
***How do we &quot;teach&quot; the basic fundamentals? By that I mean,<br/>
beyond-bedtime-story reading, spelling, writing, and <br/>
basic arithmetic. ***<br/>
<br/>
You can &quot;teach&quot; them any way you want to but that doesn&#39;t mean she will<br/>
learn what you&#39;re teaching.   If you want to know how to &quot;teach&quot; there<br/>
are teaching resources galore.  I hope you don&#39;t &quot;teach.&quot;  I hope you let<br/>
her learn. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to know how your daughter will learn, that&#39;s something she<br/>
will show you.  She will learn to read by being read to, by having access<br/>
to books and the freedom to explore.  She&#39;ll learn by experimenting with<br/>
writing - she&#39;ll write jumbles of letters and be pleased about what she&#39;s<br/>
done.  She&#39;ll pretend to read and be very satisfied. She&#39;ll start to<br/>
recognize letters and remember where she saw them before and when the<br/>
time is right for her it will all come together and she&#39;ll begin to read.<br/>
 It might take a month or it might take twelve years.  But because she<br/>
lives with people who read, in a world where written language is<br/>
everywhere, she&#39;ll learn. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll write when she has a reason to and she&#39;ll spell well or poorly<br/>
according to her nature.  Enough people had trouble spelling well that we<br/>
now have spell check and other wondrous things to help us communicate<br/>
better.  (Like telephones! No spelling!)<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll learn about math when she wants to buy toys, keep score in a game<br/>
or divide cookies fairly among friends.   If she finds math interesting<br/>
she&#39;ll look for ways to learn more about it.   If she doesn&#39;t, maybe her<br/>
talents will be for other things. <br/>
<br/>
***My state requires a yearly written assessment of <br/>
Reading, Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies, and <br/>
standardized testing every three years starting at the end of third <br/>
grade.  How does the unschooling model conform to these <br/>
requirements?***<br/>
<br/>
My state doesn&#39;t require testing but if you can find other unschoolers in<br/>
your area and talk with them I&#39;m sure they have strategies.<br/>
My state doesn&#39;t require yearly assessments either but I could easily<br/>
write about what Dylan has done.  I have a huge calendar and because I<br/>
have a mind like a steel sieve, I write everything down.  So my calendar<br/>
has the dates we went to the punkin&#39; chunkin, and the dog show and the<br/>
symphony. I have notations about hikes and fossil hunting expeditions and<br/>
museum visits and art gallery tours and clay classes and martial arts<br/>
tournaments, and ...  Life won&#39;t let you down. &lt;g&gt;  You&#39;ll find your<br/>
assessment material. <br/>
<br/>
***What  do we say to Jane&#39;s parents when they pitch the inevitable fit?<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bye!&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  You can tell them you&#39;re considering homeschooling.  You can<br/>
tell them you&#39;re going to see how it goes.  You can tell them Bree can go<br/>
to school if she wants to.   The less you talk to them about your<br/>
personal decisions the fewer fits they can pitch.  She&#39;s not their child<br/>
and it&#39;s not their place to make decisions about your family.   You are<br/>
not required by law to let them fling the poo of negativity on you.  <br/>
<br/>
We said &quot;Dylan doesn&#39;t want to go to kindergarten.&quot;  That was ok with the<br/>
family members who were living near us because they could see he was<br/>
happy and bright and not missing anything.  Compulsory school age is<br/>
seven here, so they weren&#39;t in panic mode yet.  When he was six we said<br/>
&quot;He doesn&#39;t want to go to school.&quot;  That was still ok with the closer<br/>
relatives because he wasn&#39;t compulsory school age.  Family members who<br/>
lived elsewhere started to get nervous though.  At seven he didn&#39;t want<br/>
to go to school so we finally said &quot;homeschool.&quot;   Those who saw Dylan<br/>
everyday were ok with it because they knew we were busy doing all kinds<br/>
of things and most of them were smart enough to realize he&#39;d never be<br/>
doing those things if he was stuck at school.  This was when I started<br/>
getting letters from concerned relatives who did not live near us.  They<br/>
started sending articles about education.   <br/>
<br/>
It was a hassle for awhile but as Dylan got older those who would compare<br/>
him with their schooled children found a kid who was smart, interested,<br/>
thoughtful and engaged.   Dylan himself became the reassurance they<br/>
needed.   It will be that way with your daughter too. <br/>
<br/>
***If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, <br/>
how do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>
achievement?***<br/>
<br/>
Philosophically grades don&#39;t matter, they mean nothing to a life long,<br/>
natural learner.  I hope you can really think about this.  A grade is a<br/>
judgement about another persons learning and it has never and can never<br/>
help anyone learn anything real.   Grades (and tests) are dangerous and<br/>
spirt crushing.  <br/>
<br/>
But since your state requires testing, and if you intend to comply with<br/>
the law, ask other unschoolers how they&#39;ve done it.  <br/>
<br/>
Some places let you pick the test and the test results don&#39;t matter. <br/>
They don&#39;t have any bearing, according to the law, on whether you can<br/>
continue to keep her out of school.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people join umbrella schools that can help unschoolers with testing<br/>
requirements. <br/>
<br/>
I have read different things.   Someone once said their child magically<br/>
&quot;skipped&quot; those grades where testing was required.  So for two years she<br/>
was in &quot;second grade&quot; and then she &quot;jumped ahead&quot; to fourth.   <br/>
<br/>
If you are opposed to the concept of testing in general you could move to<br/>
a state that doesn&#39;t require testing.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125007566">Dear Jeff,<br/>
I only have a second but couldn&#39;t resist commenting that I think you two are<br/>
off to a great start.  It seems like you both have the same goals for your<br/>
family and your Type A personality can get the ball rolling with reading,<br/>
research and asking questions but you&#39;ll probably find that your wife&#39;s more<br/>
laid back nature will prove out that as Bree grows and learns and *is* most<br/>
things really will &quot;take care of themselves&quot; as you said.  My bit of advise<br/>
is to read some unschooling websites and lists like this one.  Let that lead<br/>
you to books that strike your fancy and also try to get to know some local<br/>
families who are doing it.  There&#39;s nothing like relationships with other<br/>
unschoolers.  Our play group has families who&#39;s children are not &quot;school<br/>
age&quot; and we don&#39;t think that&#39;s strange at all.  Also attachment parenting<br/>
resources may be helpful to you at this stage in your lives.<br/>
<br/>
You have years before you have to be concerned about your state&#39;s laws -<br/>
really.  And by that time they very may well have changed.  If it makes you<br/>
feel better you can look up what you need to know on www.nhen.org  but I<br/>
truly wouldn&#39;t waste time on it now.  Bree&#39;s babyhood will be over in the<br/>
blink of an eye and I urge you not to waste a minute away from her on the<br/>
legalities of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Avoid declaring your unschooling status to people who might object (MIL, DS<br/>
etc.) after all, By the time they start asking about little Bree&#39;s schooling<br/>
years will have passed. Why have those arguments early?<br/>
<br/>
FWIW My family took a detour from our AP, unscooly beginnings to send two of<br/>
our children to a first rate Montessori school and we regret doing that a<br/>
lot.  It was way better in some respects than traditional school but still<br/>
not even close to as good as we have it now with all af them unschooled.  It<br/>
was a detour I avoided with my third child.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, relax, enjoy the baby, read Holt cause you&#39;ll find him interesting<br/>
(not as a how-to but just cuz *you* will enjoy it.) Love hug kiss live but<br/>
don&#39;t try to &quot;teach fundamentals&quot;  Bree will stun you with her ability to<br/>
learn what she needs to know - always.  OK I was supposed to be quick.<br/>
LOL<br/>

a home where books are joyfully read will want to read, just as a <br/>
baby in a house where people speak will want to speak. A child in a <br/>
home where arithmetic is used, whether it be for cooking or <br/>
calculating the total on a shopping list or the angle for a new <br/>
cabinet, will want to know how it all works. They&#39;ll pick it up in <br/>
drips and drabs and before you know it, they can do it. You&#39;ll see as <br/>
your daughter learns and grows that there&#39;s very rarely a moment when <br/>
something is learned or not learned. It&#39;s all a continuum. A baby <br/>
babbles and learns to make noises with their mouth - are they <br/>
talking? Then they repeat a sound that they know makes a <br/>
word &quot;mamamamamama&quot; - is this talking? One day they point to <br/>
something and say a real word (my daughter&#39;s was &quot;duck!&quot; after which <br/>
she called all birds ducks :-) - but is this talking? They add more <br/>
and more and more words to their vocabulary and one day they string 2 <br/>
words together &quot;me milk!&quot;. Eventually they talk in complete sentences <br/>
but with limited vocabulary, and at some point you realize that their <br/>
vocabulary is the equivalent of an adults. At what point on this <br/>
continuum are they actually &quot;talking&quot;? Every step along the way is a <br/>
part of the learning, and all of it is exciting to watch and be a <br/>
part of and encourage. Right now, my daughter is sounding out every <br/>
word she sees, from cereal boxes to book covers. She&#39;s in that <br/>
process with reading and it&#39;s exciting to watch too. Some day, before <br/>
I know it, she&#39;ll be picking up books and reading them, and I won&#39;t <br/>
exactly be able to put my finger on the moment that she &quot;learned to <br/>
read&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For us, it hasn&#39;t been a problem so far. Our son will do his 3rd <br/>
grade assessment next year and we&#39;re not worried about it. Though we <br/>
haven&#39;t sat down and done any kind of lessons, he can read, write, <br/>
and do &#39;rithmatic, he&#39;s just picked it up along the way. I can&#39;t <br/>
speak to the yearly assessment as our state doesn&#39;t have that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What  do we say to Jane&#39;s parents when they pitch the <br/>
&gt; inevitable fit? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I wouldn&#39;t say anything for at least a few years. There&#39;s just <br/>
not much point if you know someone is going to be antagonistic about <br/>
it. At 5 or 6 years, or even 7 (which is the compulsory attendance <br/>
age in our state), you can just say that you&#39;re homeschooling. By <br/>
then, I&#39;m betting there will be even millions more homeschoolers than <br/>
there are now, and already it&#39;s not such an unusual thing. My mom (a <br/>
former educator) was fairly opposed at the first, but I always like <br/>
to say &quot;the proof is in the pudding&quot;. Very few people, when they meet <br/>
our interesting, engaging, and exuberant kids, could have any <br/>
objections to the way we&#39;re choose to unschool them. My parents <br/>
definitely don&#39;t have any objections any more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, <br/>
&gt; how do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>
&gt; achievement?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can choose to decide however it will benefit her the best. In our <br/>
case, we chose the latest grade that we could, because it would delay <br/>
the year that our kids will be tested. Our son is on the cusp between <br/>
two school years, and we chose the earlier one (so right now, he&#39;s <br/>
officially in &quot;2nd grade&quot;). For a local homeschool resource center, <br/>
we might choose 3rd grade if he wants to get into a particular class <br/>
(he&#39;s very into robotics right now, for instance, and the robotics <br/>
classes they offer are for older kids).<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our goal is a healthy, happy, well-adjusted daughter, unlimited in <br/>
&gt; her future prospects - while keeping Mom and Dad out of jail for <br/>
&gt; failing to follow the rules.  Any advice, resources, etc. that you <br/>
&gt; folks can recommend would be gratefully received.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about jail. I know at least that in <br/>
our state if you&#39;re out of compliance with the homeschool rules, they <br/>
send you a letter and you just have to get *in* compliance. I think <br/>
the worst thing that could happen would be that they would mandate <br/>
your child has to go to school. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got many years before you have to worry about any of the legal <br/>
aspects - probably at least 6 or 7. Right now, I&#39;d just concentrate <br/>
on living in the moment, enjoying your daughter, and watching her <br/>
live and learn. Actually, that&#39;s great advice for the next couple of <br/>
decades!<br/>

able to &quot;get our ducks in a row&quot; before she is &quot;supposed&quot; to start <br/>
school, and to ensure that we don&#39;t make fatal errors in judgment <br/>
that will cause later problems.***<br/>
<br/>
Everything seems so urgent when you have a brand new baby.   Your sense<br/>
of responsibility is overwhelmed with the realization there is a life<br/>
depending on the decisions you make.  I felt just like you when my son<br/>
Dylan was born.  It seems like there isn&#39;t enough time to get everything<br/>
right. <br/>
<br/>
The good news is you do have time.  The bad news is you won&#39;t get<br/>
everything right.&lt;g&gt;  But even the bad news isn&#39;t all bad because in your<br/>
mistakes you&#39;ll be learning something about yourself and your daughter<br/>
and you&#39;ll do better the next time.   So my first advice to you is to<br/>
relax and enjoy your new baby.  <br/>
<br/>
***First, where does one start?***<br/>
<br/>
Start by assuming everything is all right.  Trust your daughter as a<br/>
human being will want to do what humans do.   Be loving, generous with<br/>
your time, be willing to participate in her world.  Accept that she is<br/>
and will be her own person and doesn&#39;t need to be shaped or molded by you<br/>
or society.  <br/>
<br/>
***How do we &quot;teach&quot; the basic fundamentals? By that I mean,<br/>
beyond-bedtime-story reading, spelling, writing, and <br/>
basic arithmetic. ***<br/>
<br/>
You can &quot;teach&quot; them any way you want to but that doesn&#39;t mean she will<br/>
learn what you&#39;re teaching.   If you want to know how to &quot;teach&quot; there<br/>
are teaching resources galore.  I hope you don&#39;t &quot;teach.&quot;  I hope you let<br/>
her learn. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to know how your daughter will learn, that&#39;s something she<br/>
will show you.  She will learn to read by being read to, by having access<br/>
to books and the freedom to explore.  She&#39;ll learn by experimenting with<br/>
writing - she&#39;ll write jumbles of letters and be pleased about what she&#39;s<br/>
done.  She&#39;ll pretend to read and be very satisfied. She&#39;ll start to<br/>
recognize letters and remember where she saw them before and when the<br/>
time is right for her it will all come together and she&#39;ll begin to read.<br/>
It might take a month or it might take twelve years.  But because she<br/>
lives with people who read, in a world where written language is<br/>
everywhere, she&#39;ll learn. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll write when she has a reason to and she&#39;ll spell well or poorly<br/>
according to her nature.  Enough people had trouble spelling well that we<br/>
now have spell check and other wondrous things to help us communicate<br/>
better.  (Like telephones! No spelling!)<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll learn about math when she wants to buy toys, keep score in a game<br/>
or divide cookies fairly among friends.   If she finds math interesting<br/>
she&#39;ll look for ways to learn more about it.   If she doesn&#39;t, maybe her<br/>
talents will be for other things. <br/>
<br/>
***My state requires a yearly written assessment of <br/>
Reading, Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies, and <br/>
standardized testing every three years starting at the end of third <br/>
grade.  How does the unschooling model conform to these <br/>
requirements?***<br/>
<br/>
My state doesn&#39;t require testing but if you can find other unschoolers in<br/>
your area and talk with them I&#39;m sure they have strategies.<br/>
My state doesn&#39;t require yearly assessments either but I could easily<br/>
write about what Dylan has done.  I have a huge calendar and because I<br/>
have a mind like a steel sieve, I write everything down.  So my calendar<br/>
has the dates we went to the punkin&#39; chunkin, and the dog show and the<br/>
symphony. I have notations about hikes and fossil hunting expeditions and<br/>
museum visits and art gallery tours and clay classes and martial arts<br/>
tournaments, and ...  Life won&#39;t let you down. &lt;g&gt;  You&#39;ll find your<br/>
assessment material. <br/>
<br/>
***What  do we say to Jane&#39;s parents when they pitch the inevitable fit?<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bye!&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  You can tell them you&#39;re considering homeschooling.  You can<br/>
tell them you&#39;re going to see how it goes.  You can tell them Bree can go<br/>
to school if she wants to.   The less you talk to them about your<br/>
personal decisions the fewer fits they can pitch.  She&#39;s not their child<br/>
and it&#39;s not their place to make decisions about your family.   You are<br/>
not required by law to let them fling the poo of negativity on you.  <br/>
<br/>
We said &quot;Dylan doesn&#39;t want to go to kindergarten.&quot;  That was ok with the<br/>
family members who were living near us because they could see he was<br/>
happy and bright and not missing anything.  Compulsory school age is<br/>
seven here, so they weren&#39;t in panic mode yet.  When he was six we said<br/>
&quot;He doesn&#39;t want to go to school.&quot;  That was still ok with the closer<br/>
relatives because he wasn&#39;t compulsory school age.  Family members who<br/>
lived elsewhere started to get nervous though.  At seven he didn&#39;t want<br/>
to go to school so we finally said &quot;homeschool.&quot;   Those who saw Dylan<br/>
everyday were ok with it because they knew we were busy doing all kinds<br/>
of things and most of them were smart enough to realize he&#39;d never be<br/>
doing those things if he was stuck at school.  This was when I started<br/>
getting letters from concerned relatives who did not live near us.  They<br/>
started sending articles about education.   <br/>
<br/>
It was a hassle for awhile but as Dylan got older those who would compare<br/>
him with their schooled children found a kid who was smart, interested,<br/>
thoughtful and engaged.   Dylan himself became the reassurance they<br/>
needed.   It will be that way with your daughter too. <br/>
<br/>
***If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, <br/>
how do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>
achievement?***<br/>
<br/>
Philosophically grades don&#39;t matter, they mean nothing to a life long,<br/>
natural learner.  I hope you can really think about this.  A grade is a<br/>
judgement about another persons learning and it has never and can never<br/>
help anyone learn anything real.   Grades (and tests) are dangerous and<br/>
spirt crushing.  <br/>
<br/>
But since your state requires testing, and if you intend to comply with<br/>
the law, ask other unschoolers how they&#39;ve done it.  <br/>
<br/>
Some places let you pick the test and the test results don&#39;t matter. <br/>
They don&#39;t have any bearing, according to the law, on whether you can<br/>
continue to keep her out of school.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people join umbrella schools that can help unschoolers with testing<br/>
requirements. <br/>
<br/>
I have read different things.   Someone once said their child magically<br/>
&quot;skipped&quot; those grades where testing was required.  So for two years she<br/>
was in &quot;second grade&quot; and then she &quot;jumped ahead&quot; to fourth.   <br/>
<br/>
If you are opposed to the concept of testing in general you could move to<br/>
a state that doesn&#39;t require testing.   <br/>

I appreciate the great advice... most of which we have already decided to adopt: no worries about the Laws or the in-laws, no artificial constraints, etc.<br/>

Dear Jeff,<br/>
I only have a second but couldn&#39;t resist commenting that I think you two are<br/>
off to a great start.  It seems like you both have the same goals for your<br/>
family and your Type A personality can get the ball rolling with reading,<br/>
research and asking questions but you&#39;ll probably find that your wife&#39;s more<br/>
laid back nature will prove out that as Bree grows and learns and *is* most<br/>
things really will &quot;take care of themselves&quot; as you said.  My bit of advise<br/>
is to read some unschooling websites and lists like this one.  Let that lead<br/>
you to books that strike your fancy and also try to get to know some local<br/>
families who are doing it.  There&#39;s nothing like relationships with other<br/>
unschoolers.  Our play group has families who&#39;s children are not &quot;school<br/>
age&quot; and we don&#39;t think that&#39;s strange at all.  Also attachment parenting<br/>
resources may be helpful to you at this stage in your lives.<br/>
<br/>
You have years before you have to be concerned about your state&#39;s laws -<br/>
really.  And by that time they very may well have changed.  If it makes you<br/>
feel better you can look up what you need to know on www.nhen.org  but I<br/>
truly wouldn&#39;t waste time on it now.  Bree&#39;s babyhood will be over in the<br/>
blink of an eye and I urge you not to waste a minute away from her on the<br/>
legalities of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Avoid declaring your unschooling status to people who might object (MIL, DS<br/>
etc.) after all, By the time they start asking about little Bree&#39;s schooling<br/>
years will have passed. Why have those arguments early?<br/>
<br/>
FWIW My family took a detour from our AP, unscooly beginnings to send two of<br/>
our children to a first rate Montessori school and we regret doing that a<br/>
lot.  It was way better in some respects than traditional school but still<br/>
not even close to as good as we have it now with all af them unschooled.  It<br/>
was a detour I avoided with my third child.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, relax, enjoy the baby, read Holt cause you&#39;ll find him interesting<br/>
(not as a how-to but just cuz *you* will enjoy it.) Love hug kiss live but<br/>
don&#39;t try to &quot;teach fundamentals&quot;  Bree will stun you with her ability to<br/>
learn what she needs to know - always.  OK I was supposed to be quick.<br/>

&gt; how do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can choose to decide however it will benefit her the best. In our <br/>
case, we chose the latest grade that we could, because it would delay <br/>
the year that our kids will be tested. Our son is on the cusp between <br/>
two school years, and we chose the earlier one (so right now, he&#39;s <br/>
officially in &quot;2nd grade&quot;). For a local homeschool resource center, <br/>
we might choose 3rd grade if he wants to get into a particular class <br/>
(he&#39;s very into robotics right now, for instance, and the robotics <br/>
classes they offer are for older kids).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our goal is a healthy, happy, well-adjusted daughter, unlimited in <br/>
&gt; her future prospects - while keeping Mom and Dad out of jail for <br/>
&gt; failing to follow the rules.  Any advice, resources, etc. that you <br/>
&gt; folks can recommend would be gratefully received.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about jail. I know at least that in <br/>
our state if you&#39;re out of compliance with the homeschool rules, they <br/>
send you a letter and you just have to get *in* compliance. I think <br/>
the worst thing that could happen would be that they would mandate <br/>
your child has to go to school. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got many years before you have to worry about any of the legal <br/>
aspects - probably at least 6 or 7. Right now, I&#39;d just concentrate <br/>
on living in the moment, enjoying your daughter, and watching her <br/>
live and learn. Actually, that&#39;s great advice for the next couple of <br/>
decades!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know I&#39;m not the one that originally wrote about Montesorri, but I thought I would share our experience.<br/>
<br/>
We did Montesorri with our oldest dd for 1.5 years.  Although she had a wonderfully loving teacher and room filled with so many things that encouraged learning, she was bored.  Despite what Montesorri claims, they can still only offer so much &quot;advance work&quot; and they still push children to grasp ideas that they may not be ready for.  I really believe the Waldorf philosophy that most children do not have all the skills necessary to read until around age 7.  It&#39;s like teaching a toddler to ride a two wheel bicycle when they haven&#39;t even mastered walking.  They need to be able to balance, stand well on one foot, be able to pedal their feet, and be able to do two things at the same time (pedal and steer).  Most toddlers can&#39;t do these things well.  That&#39;s why we give them tricycles or ride-on toys that they push with their feet.  <br/>
<br/>
There is still a lot of classroom competition.  For instance, a child who is behind his peers feels the pressure to catch up.  And the system is set up to make the &quot;next step&quot; seem better than the current one.  &quot;When you master addition and subtraction, then you can do *multiplication!*&quot;  And it is about mastering, not just attempting.  They have to show mastery in a subject before they move on.  I have a child that detests that sort of roteness to prove that she figured something out.  I can&#39;t tell you how many times in our ventures into schooling that I heard, &quot;Why do I have to do this over and over and over again to prove that I know how to do it?  I&#39;m ready to move on and learn something different NOW!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There were many things that we didn&#39;t care for in the Montesorri school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375546997">We looked into Montessori around the same time I was exploring <br/>
homeschooling, when Em (7) was around 2.5 years old. My biggest beef was <br/>
the rigidity of it. There is one right way to use something, and a child <br/>
cannot use that thing until they&#39;ve been shown the &quot;right&quot; way and <br/>
cannot move on until they&#39;ve demonstrated mastery of the &quot;right&quot; way. I <br/>
found that basic concept antithetical to real learning, though I did <br/>
like other aspects, particularly the way the method focuses on <br/>
empowering children and giving the &quot;real&quot; tools instead of pretend ones.<br/>
