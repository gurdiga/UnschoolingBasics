<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116171518">I don&#39;t know what will fit your son but it sounds to me like you&#39;re off to a good start! :)<br/>
<br/>
Nance<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I asked him this way... &quot;Tomorrow morning when  <br/>
you wake up and you could suddenly read and write better would you  <br/>
like that or would it not matter, no big deal?&quot;  He immediately  <br/>
responded positive saying that that would be nice.  I asked him if he  <br/>
would like it enough to be willing or want to work at it not in a  <br/>
schooly way but in a way that would be fun and when he wanted to work  <br/>
on it.  He said yes.  I asked what that would look like for him and  <br/>
he couldn&#39;t come up with an answer.  At one point he said that he  <br/>
would like to be able to write neater.  He didn&#39;t seem too interested  <br/>
in cursive.  He also said that he&#39;s ok with how he currently reads,  <br/>
but as we talked about it he sounded like he wouldn&#39;t mind reading  <br/>
better.  So?... we decided to think about it and talk about it  <br/>
tomorrow again.<br/>
<br/>
I ask all of you... what would that look like?  What are some fun  <br/>
writing and reading ideas that are natural and not schooly??<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My son too wanted to learn to print and spell better (he&#39;s nearly <br/>
 </span></blockquote>9). We made our own crosswords of words that meant something to him <br/>
(lizard, nintendo, his sister&#39;s name etc.). There is a great website <br/>
(I&#39;ll look for the link) that puts it all together for you.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing ever seemed to interest him at the library! He would feel <br/>
angry as his sisters grabbed armloads of books and he couldn&#39;t find <br/>
one.  <br/>
<br/>
He does love to tell his own made up stories...so I would type them <br/>
as he spoke and then we would read them together. He would get so <br/>
excited by his stories and add drawings. He would then write a Part 2 <br/>
and Part 3... Now he emails his stories (poor spelling & punctuation <br/>
& all) to his grandma. After his 3rd or 4th email, he started asking <br/>
me how to spell certain words. <br/>
<br/>
These were just a couple of &quot;unschooly&quot; things we did and it helped <br/>
him a lot. <br/>
