has made our lives more pleasant. It&#39;s pulled a cold front down, and we made <br/>
a record low of 66 degrees last night. The high today was 83 degrees with LOW <br/>
humidity...unheard of in mid-August. I just came home from work and it felt <br/>
like OCTOBER out there. Totally awesome. I just wish it didn&#39;t come at such a <br/>
high price for others. We&#39;ll get our turn eventually.....<br/>
Same here in Louisiana...made for some absolutely gorgeous weather this <br/>
weekend! Everytime a hurricane forms, we watch it like hawks.  We haven&#39;t had a <br/>
major hit in awhile but we always know that it is a very real possiblity every <br/>
time. ~Denise<br/>
