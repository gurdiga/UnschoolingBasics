<div id="ygrps-yiv-84447525">&quot;I guess if I had had to say it more than once or twice,<br/>
there would definitely have been something else going on, and anyway,<br/>
saying something like that more than once or twice can only bring<br/>
diminishing returns, no?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not necessarily.<br/>
Jalen just didn&#39;t have the capability to stay calm, but at the same<br/>
time I wasn&#39;t enjoying the way he shreiked at me. I look at it as<br/>
gentle reminders over years, to help him figure it out in his own time.<br/>
<br/>
He needed more time than other children, that&#39;s all. :)<br/>
I think some kids need more reminders over a longer span of time. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My girls all needed to learn how to handle PMS without being rude and  <br/>
short-tempered. So - we had this situation as they hit puberty. I  <br/>
still sometimes say, &quot;Here, but please don&#39;t talk to me like that.&quot;  <br/>
Or, &quot;Did I do something to deserve being spoken to that way?&quot; (Mostly  <br/>
to my 15 yo, who has the least experience with dealing with PMS, of  <br/>
course.)<br/>
<br/>
So - not just good advice for responding to little kids.<br/>
