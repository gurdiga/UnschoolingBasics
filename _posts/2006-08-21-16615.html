<div id="ygrps-yiv-591068173">*****I wanted to ask what you do about a negative attitude***** <br/>
<br/>
I have a 7yo who sounds just like your son. I don&#39;t have an answer for your son but I know when Coty says its too hard, its usually just because he wants company. If the other kids have gone to bed and he wants a track made he makes the most amazing tracks all by himself, so I know he can do it by himself, he just doesn&#39;t want to be alone.  <br/>
<br/>
Coty gets easily frustrated also, so I try & keep the frustrating activities to a minimum and if he wants to try something I think would be frustrating for him we try it together.  Could it be your son is not being negative but is frustrated or just doesn&#39;t think he has the ability to do the task (?) before him?<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to have an area where the tracks could be set up for a long period of time so he doesn&#39;t have to set them up everytime he wants to use them?<br/>
<br/>
Even at 7 I love the fact that Coty is so dependant on me ;)  My older kids are much more independant and I love having a little one ask me for help in his adventures.  Maybe your son is just not ready to be more independant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876258623">The first thought that came to mind is why this is perceived as a negative attitude?  Maybe it&#39;s just not a clear communication of his desire.  Perhaps he doesn&#39;t want to put his dish in the dishwasher.  Is he allowed to say no?   As for the toys, wow, he&#39;s asking to engage with you.  He needs your assistance.  A time will come when he won&#39;t ask for your help.  The last thing i would want is to turn my daughter away from feeling comfortable asking me for help with anything.  It doesn&#39;t always mean i&#39;m always able to drop everything and help at that very moment but i wouldn&#39;t want her to not trust that i am available to her when she needs help.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I want to help him feel more confident and more independent. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think confidence comes from being respected.  If his request for help or his declining to help you is not respected he is being judged negatively.  Perhaps the negative attitude is not your 5yo sons at all &lt;g&gt;.  As for independence, is pushing someone towards something really independence? Is moving someone in a direction they are not ready or willing to do really independence?  Is behavior as a result of being manipulated really independence?   I think an unschooled child does become independent because they know what is it to be trusted and respected and valued.  Not manipulated, pushed or devalued.<br/>
<br/>
He is so young.  I would respond positively to him with a loving gentle voice.  Watch out for your expectations of what you think he should be doing or not doing.  He will surprise you.  <br/>
<br/>
Its a wonderful journey.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055080202">There are several things here that I would like to comment on.  <br/>
First, you have labeled your son&#39;s reactions as a `negative <br/>
attitude&#39;.  Instead of seeing this as an attitude problem it might <br/>
be more helpful to see his reaction as an attempt to communicate his <br/>
needs.  `Negative Attitude&#39; makes it sound like he is not trying his <br/>
best or is being lazy.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I question lumping together the help he needs when playing <br/>
legos etc. and the help he needs when putting a dish away.  It is <br/>
unlikely that he is motivated in the same way when doing these two <br/>
activities.  Being asked or told to put a dish away is very <br/>
different than sitting down to some legos to play.  Perhaps each <br/>
problem should be addressed separately.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mind you, I was doing the rest and<br/>
he just was asked to do one plate, since he was standing there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What is your motive for asking your son to put away a dish? Was it <br/>
really because he was standing there?  Or, is it for some other <br/>
reason?  Do you wish for him to participate in family chores?  Do <br/>
you think that putting away a dish will make him more independent?  <br/>
More confident?  Are you using this to get your five year old to <br/>
recognize just how hard it is being a mom/grown up?<br/>
<br/>
What did you say to him right after he said it would take all day?  <br/>
Did your words validate or invalidate his feelings?<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, can your son say, `No&#39;, without being made to feel <br/>
guilty or ashamed?  If the putting the plate away comes piled with <br/>
guilt/shame/lack of choice, then perhaps moving all those ucky <br/>
feelings along with it _does_ seem as if it will take all day.<br/>
<br/>
I would just feel fabulous if I could say no and my Mom made me feel <br/>
that it was ok.  Alternatively, I can imagine how much lighter the <br/>
task would be for me if I got help with the plate when asked to put <br/>
it away.  If you and he work together, the plate may become a moment <br/>
to share and not an object of struggle.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I want to help him feel more confident and more<br/>
independent.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Five is so very young to put such heavy words on a little one such <br/>
as confidence and independence. Hold him, play with him and drink in <br/>
every moment of him.  These things will give him the firm foundation <br/>
to become confident and independent in his own time.<br/>
<br/>
I know how difficult it can be when a little one is frustrated with <br/>
his play things and wants you to be right at his side.  My son would <br/>
spend hours lining up hot-wheels cars up in rows and demand that I <br/>
be present and want me to occasionally place a car myself.  There <br/>
was one car that was very difficult to tell its front from its back <br/>
and I made the mistake of lining it up wrong one day.  My son cried <br/>
for an hour (or at least it seemed as long).  Those were trying <br/>
days, but I would never have wanted him to be more independent.  He <br/>
needed me right there for every car and every row.<br/>

9.99 times out of 10 it was quicker and easier and less stressful for<br/>
*all* if I just did it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>******************<br/>
I knew a lady who bought a cheap set of wood trains and glued them to<br/>
a piece of sanded plywood (I want to say she put something around the<br/>
edges as well) for her children when they were really younger.  She<br/>
made sure that it has crossings and overpasses and places to<br/>
&quot;uncouple&quot; trains but it was big enough and simple enough that they<br/>
could move the cars around and do imagination play.  As they got older<br/>
and were better able to engineer the rails to do what they wanted them<br/>
to then she pulled out the huge (and ever growing) box of wooden<br/>
rails.  The other thing that was nice about this is that it slid under<br/>
their beds so it stored easily even if they left it scattered.  She<br/>
could easily just dump everything onto the plywood and slide it under<br/>
the bed.<br/>
<br/>
I know that there are &quot;rail design programs&quot; on the internet that tell<br/>
you how to build different configurations.  I haven&#39;t been to one in<br/>
many years, but remember finding them when Keon was wanting<br/>
&quot;blueprints&quot; like his daddy&#39;s model railroads.  Sometimes though, you<br/>
can find unique ways to foster self confidence by helping them.  Help<br/>
him sort his rails into different sizes and shapes, show him how the<br/>
small curves make tight circles and the large curves make big circles<br/>
and how switching them around you can make S&#39;s or other squiggles.<br/>
See how long you can make a track through your house without going in<br/>
a circle (something that still gets done here and it surprises me how<br/>
many feet of track we actually own!)<br/>
<br/>
While you may not have an interest in playing with trains your son<br/>
does.  Get excited about his world.  Strew trains for him!  Find out<br/>
from a local terminal or railyard when trains come through and couple<br/>
and uncouple and see if you can arrange to go watch it (even if just<br/>
from a safe distance).  Once, though, I took my son to a lumber yard<br/>
that had deliveries and the owner let us go and sit on one of the<br/>
delivery docks and watch the trains back up and uncouple.  Very cool<br/>
day and all the lumber yard workers were about as fascinated as Keon<br/>
was!<br/>
<br/>
By appreciating his world he will learn to appreciate his abilities!<br/>

<br/>
Oh yes!! I talked about that in Peabody (I think?) how Markus would<br/>
stand in the kitchen hollering for whoever left the mayonaisse out to<br/>
come put it away. He was standing right next to the fridge!! I pointed<br/>
out how much energy it was taking to track down the culprit vs. just<br/>
putting it AWAY. Duh.<br/>
<br/>
When he started asking &quot;who left this out&quot; I would say &quot;I don&#39;t know,<br/>
but it&#39;s sure quick to put it away&quot; and I&#39;d put it away. He doesn&#39;t do<br/>
that anymore.;) At least not very often.<br/>
<br/>
I think it pays to look at motivation. If we&#39;re asking our kids to do<br/>
something to &quot;teach&quot; them responsibility instead of honestly needing<br/>
help, they&#39;ll pick up on that hypocrisy and resist (smart beings that<br/>
they are). If we truly and honestly could use the help and are willing<br/>
to help them whenever they need it, they learn over time how to work<br/>
with their family. <br/>

the plate felt to you to *him* the plate felt like a big thing. And  <br/>
it may not have been the plate itself that felt big, but the plate  <br/>
may have felt like the final straw that was being placed on his back.  <br/>
His reaction may have been to the weight of all the straws of things  <br/>
he&#39;s been asked to do rather than to one particular straw. It&#39;s a  <br/>
wake up call.<br/>
<br/>
If we want them to treat our feelings with respect, we need to treat  <br/>
their feelings with respect. A better response would be to say with a  <br/>
smile, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry! Let me help you with that then!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is there a neighborhood child who could come in to play with him?  <br/>
Maybe an older, homeschooled child you could pay who could come by  <br/>
once or a few times a week specifically to play trains with him?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s easy to dismiss their needs as being burdensome, but it  <br/>
often helps to picture someone else -- some stranger perhaps -- who  <br/>
will say &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll help you with that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we push our children&#39;s needs away the children will eventually  <br/>
stop asking because they give up on us. But the needs don&#39;t go away.  <br/>
And the kids become vulnerable to those who *will* say &quot;I  <br/>
understand.&quot; and &quot;Let me help you with that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Be the one who helps him and he won&#39;t be needful of strangers who  <br/>
will help him.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that&#39;s a bit extreme. I don&#39;t think not playing trains for the  <br/>
10th time in the day will cause him to be vulnerable to predators!  <br/>
But I do think the more they feel they&#39;re our top proiority, the more  <br/>
they&#39;re feel the answer to their questions will very likely be &quot;I&#39;d  <br/>
love to help!&quot; the more full they&#39;ll be and the less likely they&#39;ll  <br/>
be looking elsewhere to get filled up and they&#39;ll also be more  <br/>
accepting of the times when we say &quot;I have to finish this first. I&#39;ll  <br/>
be there in half an hour.&quot; (And set a timer and *be* there in half an  <br/>
hour even if you&#39;re not done.)<br/>

A message we pick up from society is that a &quot;polite&quot; way of  <br/>

This may sound rough but there will come a time when you are alone. Your kids will be all grown, have lives of their own and you will have days when you wish for the company of an inquisitive (even &quot;demanding&quot;) youngster. I am very rarely alone ( I even have people look for me when I make a 30 second run for the bathroom;).<br/>
I have 6 very energetic, inquisitive, marvelous kids living at home so I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll ever have an empty home ;)  My &quot;alone&quot; time is usually right now (a.m.).  Maybe you could work around the kids sleep time?  That way you get your time & you&#39;re refreshed for when they need you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****You mentioned you son is like this, what do you do when he gets to frustrated and you can&#39;t be there immediately?****<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I drop what I&#39;m doing & go help him.  I really try during the day not to get involved in something I cannot leave at a moments notice. I find with Coty that the longer he has to wait for that help the longer it takes him to calm down. <br/>
 I have other kids here so they help out at times but I can&#39;t expect or totally depend on them to be able to help the situation.  Sometimes its just a matter of ME being there.  When I find Coty is getting frustrated with something first I try & help out but if that doesn&#39;t work, I work on getting his attention on something else. Sometimes I go thru 10 things before we find one thing that works.<br/>
A song ( loud singing & crazy dancing;), a book, making cookies, my new rocking chair works great, a massage - sometimes I do him & sometimes he wants to do me !, something he can take his frustration out on (punching bag, smashing crackers for a future casserole, even ripping up newspaper works), we&#39;ve even had an indoor &quot;snowball&quot; fight with balls of newspaper, and best of all lots of really big hugs !!<br/>
If you can find someone else to help out that would be great if he just needs help, but sometimes there is no substitute for MOM ;)<br/>
<br/>
**** We do have a room just for trains, but the tracks get broken or he wants them different.****<br/>
<br/>
Coty&#39;s favorite thing is making new tracks. Sometimes he makes the tracks & doesn&#39;t even run the trains on them. Its just the idea of making & figuring out a new combination.<br/>

 for the company of an inquisitive (even &quot;demanding&quot;) youngster.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 This may sound even rougher:<br/>
<br/>
  There could come a time when he&#39;s not there at all. When I&#39;m having <br/>
moments when I just wish Duncan would go away, I think about Lisa <br/>
Strebler, Joanna Wilkinson, and Diana Jenner. They each lost a child. <br/>
At five (car wreck), at eight (falling through ice), and at nine <br/>
(leukemia).<br/>
<br/>
  There&#39;s *nothing* that brings me back to what&#39;s important faster than <br/>
thinking---for just a moment: &quot;What would I do without him?&quot; &quot;What if <br/>
he weren&#39;t here at all?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Slams me right back into the &quot;now&quot; in the blink of an eye.<br/>
<br/>
  *I* need LOTS of alone time. Duncan needs LOTS of stimulation and to <br/>
be surrounded by friends. One family just moved to Atlanta---took <br/>
*three* of his friends! I&#39;ve had to be more available lately---*just* <br/>
when I need MORE alone time. It&#39;s really hard. It makes me *very* <br/>
tired. I can do small spurts of it, but day after day after day is <br/>
very, very hard for me. The team&#39;s been and continues to be stretched <br/>
thin: Ben&#39;s working longer days lately, and Cameron just left for a <br/>
week in Oregon---they&#39;ve been very unavailable for him too lately. It&#39;s <br/>
all fallen on me.<br/>
<br/>
  Duncan&#39;s ten, so it&#39;s a bit easier than with a five year old! &lt;g&gt; I <br/>
can ask him to play upstairs a few hours and let me have a few <br/>
uninterrupted hours to myself. August has turned into <br/>
&quot;Get-it-yourself-month&quot; around here---I&#39;ve asked him to cut down on the <br/>
&quot;Mom, can you get me...&quot; requests and just come down and get things <br/>
he&#39;s capable of.<br/>
<br/>
  But the advice you&#39;ve already gotten---to fill him UP---helps a bunch. <br/>
I asked for a few hours to myself yesterday, but only *after* we&#39;d <br/>
spent the day together shopping and running errands. Plus, his new iPod <br/>
arrived yesterday, so he could play with that (AFTER *I* had downloaded <br/>
a bunch of songs for him! &lt;g&gt;). We&#39;re leaving in a bit today for <br/>
Carowinds (theme park), where he and I will play all day together. That <br/>
time totally devoted to HIM will fill him for a while (drain me! &lt;g&gt;). <br/>
But he will get what he needs of me, wholly and completely, which will <br/>
also allow me to have some quiet time alone. When *he* is filled up, he <br/>
can allow *me* to fill up. It&#39;s a dance. Not as easy a dance to learn <br/>
as the one with my older son, who has the same temperament that I do! <br/>
&lt;G&gt; But we manage.<br/>
<br/>
  My guess (because I&#39;ve been there! &lt;G&gt;) is that you&#39;re thinking of him <br/>
as a burden. Really and truly---just changing *your* thinking will <br/>
change the way *he* acts!<br/>
<br/>
  Know that every moment could be your last. Start enjoying the time you <br/>
*do* spend with him---TRULY enjoying that time, and he&#39;ll start needing <br/>
you less. Well, it&#39;ll *seem* that way. He&#39;ll still need you, but he <br/>
won&#39;t BE as *needy*.<br/>
<br/>
  AND...he gets older every single day. &quot;This too will pass&quot;---better <br/>
carve it on your forehead or tattoo it on your ass... &lt;g&gt; Nothing lasts <br/>
forever---enjoy each moment you DO have!<br/>
<br/>
  OH! Are you coming to the conference? Diana&#39;s talking specifically <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-318555601">&lt;&lt;There could come a time when he&#39;s not there at all. When I&#39;m having<br/>
moments when I just wish Duncan would go away, I think about Lisa<br/>
Strebler, Joanna Wilkinson, and Diana Jenner. They each lost a child.<br/>
At five (car wreck), at eight (falling through ice), and at nine<br/>
(leukemia).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My trick is in the morning, or at some point in time when they are all <br/>
upstairs, I sit in my rocking chair and imagine each child coming <br/>
downstairs as they would five years from now, or ten years from now...I <br/>
play that scene over in my head and then when one does awaken and come <br/>
down, poof!  I&#39;m back in time with my precious children who are growing <br/>
too fast each day. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Know that every moment could be your last. Start enjoying the time you<br/>

won&#39;t BE as *needy*.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Since we&#39;ve incorporated the &quot;stay up as late as you want&quot; I&#39;ve gone <br/>
through a major change as far as really missing my time alone in the <br/>
peace and quiet to loving to read to them a little longer or playing <br/>
cards or watching movies later than we ever did.  I&#39;m trying to get my <br/>
dh into that same gear...he&#39;s still grumpy because he doesn&#39;t have alone <br/>
time with me but I keep telling him that &quot;this too shall pass&quot;...advice <br/>
my dear ole&#39;ma always said.  We&#39;ll miss it when the house is all quiet <br/>
and it&#39;s just us. <br/>
<br/>
I gotta go find my kids because this is bringing tears to my eyes :-(<br/>
It&#39;s hard sometimes but we&#39;ve got to ENJOY THE NOW!<br/>

I had a few joyful but teary moments this morning.  In the last month,  <br/>
Brenna has decided to take a couple of classes at the community college and was  <br/>
given a car by her dad.  This morning she had her first class and just  bounced <br/>
out the door laughing.....&quot;Mom...I&#39;m off to college!&quot;  I watched as  she got <br/>
in her car and drove away. I was overwhelmed with happiness watching her  just <br/>
filled with joy and confidence but with a huge realization that...<br/>
Damn...it is just like everyone said....&quot;it will go by in a  flash.&quot;    It <br/>
really did.<br/>

 He is so young. I would respond positively to him with a loving gentle voice. Watch out for your expectations of what you think he should be doing or not doing. He will surprise you. <br/>

 Its a wonderful journey.<br/>

 BTW, he made a great train track by himself today, for the first time.  I am trusting the process.  I am trusting the process.  I am trusting the process... it is my new mantra.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-377330193">I do have to say that I asked him to put away the plate because he was standing in front of the dishwasher.  Our kitchen is only wide enough for one at a time.  We have not stressed chores for a long time.  Sometimes they help and sometimes they don&#39;t.  It depends on their moods and what is being asked.  My 3 yo ds LOVES to clean bathrooms.  They both like to mop and vaccum.  <br/>

 If you were feeling overwhelmed wouldn&#39;t that be what you&#39;d want to  <br/>

 <br/>
 &gt; It is the same thing when he wants to build a train track for his  <br/>
 &gt; Thomas Trains or Lincon logs, legos, imaginex.  He cannot do it, he  <br/>
 &gt; needs help.<br/>
 <br/>
 Is there a neighborhood child who could come in to play with him?  <br/>
 Maybe an older, homeschooled child you could pay who could come by  <br/>
 once or a few times a week specifically to play trains with him?<br/>
   <br/>
 ** I wish his good friend that liked trains moved a few years ago.  I am always on the lookout for new friends.  All his friends that he played really well with have moved.  And school has taken most of the rest away.  I am hoping more playdates will be in his future.  We are just needing some new kids to play with.  He gets aggressive with several of the children we know, so it can be hard to find a good fit.  <br/>

 ****I know he does not want to be alone, BUT I sometimes do*****<br/>
 <br/>
 This may sound rough but there will come a time when you are alone. <br/>
 Your kids<br/>
   will be all grown, have lives of their own and you will have days when <br/>
 you wish<br/>
  for the company of an inquisitive (even &quot;demanding&quot;) youngster.<br/>
 <br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 This may sound even rougher:<br/>
 <br/>
 There could come a time when he&#39;s not there at all. When I&#39;m having <br/>
 moments when I just wish Duncan would go away, I think about Lisa <br/>
 Strebler, Joanna Wilkinson, and Diana Jenner. They each lost a child. <br/>
 At five (car wreck), at eight (falling through ice), and at nine <br/>
 (leukemia).<br/>
   <br/>
 ****  I do remember this.  My parents adopt children with AIDS and two have died.  I remember them was dealing with my children, most of the time.  <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
 <br/>
 *I* need LOTS of alone time. Duncan needs LOTS of stimulation and to <br/>
 be surrounded by friends. <br/>
   <br/>
   **This is very much our problem, I do need that time alone and have not been gettine it lately.  With two boys so close in age, I am always in ear shot.  We also have a kitten less than two weeks old that is fed every few hours.  She has just started sleeping through the night, so she is taking up the rest of my time.  I think that has made it worse.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Duncan&#39;s ten, so it&#39;s a bit easier than with a five year old! &lt;g&gt; I <br/>
 can ask him to play upstairs a few hours and let me have a few <br/>
 uninterrupted hours to myself. August has turned into <br/>
 &quot;Get-it-yourself-month&quot; around here---I&#39;ve asked him to cut down on the <br/>
 &quot;Mom, can you get me...&quot; requests and just come down and get things <br/>
 he&#39;s capable of.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 My guess (because I&#39;ve been there! &lt;G&gt;) is that you&#39;re thinking of him <br/>
 as a burden. Really and truly---just changing *your* thinking will <br/>
 change the way *he* acts!<br/>
   <br/>
 ***I&#39;m trying.<br/>
  <br/>
 <br/>
 OH! Are you coming to the conference? Diana&#39;s talking specifically <br/>

 Maybe next year it wil be much closer in NC!!<br/>
