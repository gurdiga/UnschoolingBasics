<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652893289">I just found this article about not &quot;Coddling&quot; your children. The<br/>
author starts with this premise, &quot;People are becoming less and less<br/>
resilient and more and more clueless on how to survive in the real<br/>
world.&quot; but then some of his recommendations seem truly awful. At<br/>
first glance, I would think any confusion about the &quot;real world&quot; would<br/>
come from not spending enough time in it (i.e. School). Read the<br/>
article for his solution to coddling and my comments are below the<br/>
link.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2008/06/03/quit-coddling-your-kids/">http://artofmanliness.com/2008/06/03/quit-coddling-your-kids/</a><br/>
<br/>
I would generally agree with his sentiments around these points:<br/>
<br/>
     Give them some independence<br/>
     Let them do unsafe things<br/>
     Don&#39;t automatically take their side<br/>
     Don&#39;t praise them indiscriminately<br/>
<br/>
and I was simply aghast to read what he wrote in these sections:<br/>
<br/>
     Make them work for what they get<br/>
     Don&#39;t be their best friend<br/>
<br/>
In this last section on &quot;Don&#39;t be their best friend&quot;, he offers this advice:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you insist on being your kid&#39;s best friend, a situation will<br/>
inevitably arise where you do finally try to reign them in and make<br/>
them respect you. But it will be too late; they&#39;ll feel free to toss<br/>
your advice aside like they would for any friend.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He states this as fact, when I think he is absolutely backwards in is<br/>
assumption here. Why would you finally need to reign them in as they<br/>
were becoming fully grown adults? Why would a child come to you for<br/>
advice after 18 years of disrespecting them and forcing your &quot;advice&quot;<br/>
as the law of the land?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this was so wordy.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d rephrase both of these into &quot;support them in discovering how much <br/>
independence they want *and* how much help they want.&quot; People of all <br/>
ages learn some things on their own and some things with assistance. <br/>
Its really really useful to understand one&#39;s own learning process - <br/>
at any age.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      Don&#39;t automatically take their side<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is strange coming right after those first two - in order to give <br/>
kids space to try things on their own, we have to be on their side. <br/>
We have to be ready to trust - maybe trust with one hand out to catch <br/>
them if they fall, but trust that *they* believe they are ready. My <br/>
kids are often more ready for whatever they&#39;re doing than *I* am ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also found that my kids do best in social situations when I&#39;m <br/>
right there, backing them up. Adults tend to be really grossly <br/>
obnoxious to kids and it helps a ton to have another adult <br/>
saying &quot;hey, that&#39;s not called for.&quot; Other kids... how do I put this? <br/>
I tend not to &quot;dump&quot; my kids in social situations they aren&#39;t ready <br/>
to handle. I&#39;m there supporting them. I mean Right There - preferably <br/>
where I can see and hear what&#39;s going on. Since both my kids have <br/>
come to trust that I will back them up, and help them find solutions <br/>
to problems, they&#39;re both happy to come to me for help solving <br/>
problems. So, over time, there are more and more situations where <br/>
they say &quot;It&#39;s okay, Mer!&quot; Nowadays if my 15yo says he&#39;s fine, he&#39;s <br/>
fine. He&#39;ll leave if he&#39;s not happy in the situation - he&#39;s walked <br/>
miles to get away from a conflict and walked out of parties bc he <br/>
didn&#39;t trust the scene. I&#39;ve seen him, at the skatepark, plant <br/>
himself firmly behind the one adult skater when tempers started to <br/>
heat up between the other teens. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      Don&#39;t praise them indiscriminately<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t praise my kids. I say &quot;Thanks&quot; and &quot;I really appreciated <br/>
that&quot; and &quot;OMG that was sooooo Cool!&quot; in the same way I would say <br/>
those things to a friend. Kids don&#39;t Need praise. They need to be <br/>
treated like real people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I was simply aghast to read what he wrote in these sections:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m aghast too. Maybe disgusted is a better word, I&#39;m not exactly <br/>
surprised.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the most valuable concepts of radical unschooling is <br/>
that its okay - its even desirable - to be my kids&#39; ally. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099005999">Amen Dan!  I never, ever ask my mom for advice.  In fact, I go out of<br/>
my way to avoid my family as much and as often as possible. My DH and<br/>
I only have each other to rely on here, thankfully no family nearby as<br/>
that would make things worse!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has given me a better base of how to ask for my children&#39;s<br/>
opinions and find out why they feel a certain way or want to do<br/>
certain things.  Was this book written by a so called &quot;expert&quot;? <br/>
*sigh* we need fewer experts in the world...<br/>
