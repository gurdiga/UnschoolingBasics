<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788851023">I haven&#39;t had much time to be here...but I was reading that someone <br/>
recommended Daniel Pink&#39;s &quot;Free Agent Nation&quot; and couldn&#39;t help myself.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s donated two signed books for the conference. So if you&#39;re coming <br/>
to the conference and like his work, make sure you buy LOTS of raffle <br/>
tickets.:)<br/>
And think about donating something to the raffle, it&#39;s a most worthy <br/>
cause.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, starting to feel like a raffle queen</div>
