<div id="ygrps-yiv-915171698">Yes, Mary, you may put in new items.  Mainly I want people to not *spend* much if anything on raffle items.  I may end up buying some yarn for a raffle item, but I going to ask the shopkeeper if she will donate the yarn for my item, or maybe trade for a chair massage.  (Some of my ideas are rather extravagant, and then I think I could just donate that amount to the scholarship fund.)  <br/>

P.S. please excuse the non-trimmed post, yahoo is not allowing me to trim only a part.  hmmmm %-/<br/>

<br/>
Sure, New stuff would be fine. It&#39;s *your* $$$! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But old or gently used stuff would *not* be inappropriate! It&#39;s the <br/>
sharing of your passion, so you can be flexible.<br/>
<br/>
Some passions are expensive. I just didn&#39;t want people to think that <br/>
they have to spend big bucks to share it. Used is fine. New is fine. <br/>
Donated by a store/wholesaler is great! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>
They go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
