<div id="ygrps-yiv-437357319">We recently bought a pool for our back yard. It is a soft side round <br/>
pool that is colapsable at the end of summer. To give you an idea of <br/>
how big it is 18&#39; by 4&#39;. The ladder that came with it is not the best <br/>
but it works to get in and out. Me and the kids were in the pool today <br/>
while Charles was at work and they were jumping off the ladder onto the <br/>
pool toys and having a great time. Later on, when Charles was in the <br/>
pool with them, he got upset when they jumped off the ladder because if <br/>
it breaks we cannot really afford to replace it. I can see his point <br/>
but I also want the kids to have the best time that they can. Does <br/>
anyone have any suggestions about what we can do for the kids to jump <br/>
into the pool without dad getting mad. I was thinking about pulling <br/>
their trampoline upto the side of the pool but they cannot climb over <br/>
the sides without all of the water rushing out into the lawn. Open to <br/>
suggestions. Thanks. Mary King<br/>

Why does he think &quot;it&quot; will break?<br/>

I can say that we had an above ground pool four years running, and we  <br/>
jumped off the ladder LOTS, and it never broke. Six crazy  <br/>

 <br/>
we&#39;ve had ours two years and the kids jump off the ladder all the time. i did see a ladder at a thrift store near me, maybe you could look for one secondhand just to ease dad&#39;s mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354468626">He is afraid of faster wear and tear on both the ladder and the pool. <br/>
We dont have the money right now to replace it if it needs to be and <br/>
I am sure his fears are not being able to get into the pool and <br/>
having to spend more money. Money is tight now that we bought the <br/>
pool. We have talked about getting a better ladder in the future. If <br/>
he were to climb over one of the sides the water would come rushing <br/>
out.  Mary <br/>

covering it with a big towel helped it not be too slippery.<br/>

Do they know that they can all walk in one direction and create a whirlpool<br/>
in the middle? one of our favorite things to do in a softside pool :) You<br/>
can lift up your feet and swirl a bit!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-871090378">~~Reminds me of our favorite thing. Glow sticks in the pool at night!~~<br/>
<br/>
SOme of my favorite memories involve glowsticks!<br/>
Last year at a homeschooling camp-out a bunch of us took tons of<br/>
glowsticks down to the lake at night. It was quite a sight to see all<br/>
these moving glowsticks dancing through the woods and gathered on the<br/>
dock. One of the teens opened one up and we experimented with<br/>
splashing our clothes and the dock with it. Veeerrrrryyy eerie. Lotsa fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738706868">Such great ideas! The kids did do a whirlpool first thing as soon as <br/>
the pool was set up and they got in. I am going to try to find a second <br/>
hand ladder somewhere. maybe freecycle. We tried moving the trampoline <br/>
up to the pool today but it is a little shorter than the pool and it <br/>
has an enclosure which makes it difficult to jump off of it. Diana, <br/>
great idea about the picnic table. We dont have one yet but I will be <br/>
asking Charles to custom build one just the right size. We have some <br/>
wood he may be able to use. The glowsticks in the pool is cool. We are <br/>
going to try that. Thanks for all the awesome ideas. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739395802">It might be an idea to just let that happen - and then deal with whatever the consequences are - can&#39;t use the pool anymore?  And then that&#39;s a real thing - or it might lead to an alternative solution once it actually happens (if it even happens at all ) - because is it worth all the controlling of their behaviour for something that &quot;might&quot; happen - perhaps he could let go of it and just let it happen or not...<br/>
