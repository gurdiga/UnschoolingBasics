<div id="ygrps-yiv-51119548">Hello everyone,<br/>
    I am thoroughly enjoying the sheer volume of e-mails and insightfulness <br/>
shared on this list!  It is wonderful to have so many active people being so <br/>
open about what has and hasn&#39;t worked in their lives.<br/>
    I haven&#39;t been a member long, so I&#39;m not sure if there are folks on this <br/>
list who could help give me some suggestions.  My dh & I are contemplating <br/>
separation.  He&#39;s not a bad person or a bad father, but we are definitely at <br/>
very different places in our lives at the moment.  We will not part ways <br/>
until we can be certain that I am still able to be at home with our daughter <br/>
(almost 2).  While we may not be able to parent her under the same roof <br/>
together, we will not sacrifice her well-being for our own.  My biggest <br/>
concern about staying is modeling our relationships as an acceptable way to <br/>
live - which I fell very strongly it is not!  While we can be cordial and <br/>
respectful with one another, the affection and closeness is gone.  We view <br/>
life from very different perspectives.  Anyway, I don&#39;t really want to get <br/>
into any kind of &quot;blame game&quot; here - there are things we both could&#39;ve done <br/>
differently.<br/>
    So I guess my main questions is - how do you protect the little ones <br/>
when dealing with such &quot;adult&quot; issues that effect every aspect of their <br/>
lives???<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786395370">We have consider and re-considered this decision over and over again.  It is definitely not a decision being made lightly.  We have been together for over 12 years now and have been through a lot in that time.  The reality is that he is bi-polar.  When he is &quot;plugged-in&quot; he is a fabulous father, when he&#39;s not, he&#39;s asleep or growling.  While I would prefer not to go too deeply into our lives, perhaps a recent example may be helpful.  A few weeks ago our daughter woke up at 2 in the morning and was having a really hard time falling back asleep.  She was exhausted and crying.  His answer was to leave the bedroom and go lay on the couch.  When he left the room, she decided she wanted to go out in the living room also and have me rock her in the rocking chair.  All she wanted was to be in the same room with him while she fell back asleep.  His answer to that was that he wasn&#39;t going to be in the same room with her until she stopped screaming, and he stomped back off into the bedroom and slammed the door.  It took me about 10 minutes to get her to settle back down and go back to sleep.  The next day I tried to say to him that all she wanted was to be in the same room with him and that I thought it was really crappy that he couldn&#39;t give up 10 minutes of sleep for his 20 month old daughter.  He said she needs to learn she can&#39;t just scream to get what she wants, and he needs him sleep.  (Never mind the fact that he spent more than half the day before in bed).<br/>
    There are plenty more examples of choice I would make differently than him, but I don&#39;t really feel it&#39;s productive to get into them.  The bottom line for me is that if his almost dying didn&#39;t change his outlook on life and him literally bringing his daughter into this world (she was born at home), then what chance to I have of coming up with the right words to open his eyes.  He was raised in an abusive, alcoholic family and while he never drinks and wouldn&#39;t consider raising a hand to her, he is very much stuck in the &quot;victim mentality&quot;.  <br/>
    I posted my question to this list because I know that parents who unschool take their children&#39;s best interest very seriously.  There is a deeper dedication to children among those who take the time to actually care what their life experiences are.  If this is not an appropriate venue for my question I apologize.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043495578">Deb,  Just wanted to let you know that I&#39;m in the same boat as you.  <br/>
There is no hope for my marriage.  I still plan on unschooling after <br/>
the divorce but know that it will be extremely difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to school right now to get my real estate license.  I also <br/>
have a couple of home based businesses that I run.  That, along w/ <br/>
child support, should be enough.  I also plan on moving about two hours <br/>
south of where I am now to be closer to my brother & his family who <br/>
also homeschool for support.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to contact me off list, please email me at: <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282825517">Hi Debbie --<br/>
<br/>
Was that example about the worst thing you could think of? LOTS of  <br/>
dads don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the idea of comforting and caring for crying children  <br/>
during the night. Lots of dads don&#39;t have that nurturing sense and  <br/>
lots seem really unwilling to pay attention to baby&#39;s and young  <br/>
children&#39;s needs. Just saying, it is not uncommon.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously - I really am certain that many people have started from  <br/>
situations as bad or worse and made it better, over time.<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t come up with the right words to &quot;open his eyes,&quot; but divorce  <br/>
is truly very very hard on children and often in ways that are not  <br/>
anticipated by the parents at the time of divorce, so you&#39;re removing  <br/>
his very apparent difficult behavior and replacing it with other  <br/>
difficulties that you may not see for years.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t do it - obviously, we don&#39;t know your situation.  <br/>
You don&#39;t need to defend it here, either. Please don&#39;t take this as a  <br/>
criticism. It is just that divorce is seen as &quot;the answer&quot; by so many  <br/>
people these days and it is much easier to get divorced than imagine  <br/>
living for years with the difficulties of the marriage. There is a lot  <br/>
of support for divorce and much less support for sticking with a  <br/>
marriage that isn&#39;t working well. &quot;For the sake of the kids,&quot; is out  <br/>
of fashion, but still worth considering.<br/>
<br/>
Just giving you some support for considering. Unschooling can be  <br/>
extremely difficult for single moms and once he&#39;s not married to you,  <br/>
there is a good chance he&#39;ll find someone else to marry, have children  <br/>
with her, and that person won&#39;t be thrilled with him fully supporting  <br/>
you and things could get much harder.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Hi Debbie,<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s tough to find the good when you&#39;re feeling so bad; I&#39;ve <br/>
been there, done that.  I&#39;m one who has &quot;stuck it out&quot; even when <br/>
everyone else told me to leave... and I&#39;m so glad that I have.  One <br/>
question that really helped me to wrap my brain around the possibility <br/>
of *staying* was, &quot;Would things really be BETTER if we weren&#39;t <br/>
together?&quot;  Of course they would be different, but would they be <br/>
BETTER?  Using your example - would your daughter have calmed down any <br/>
sooner if dh was not in the house?  Knowing he&#39;s in the next room but <br/>
not visible might be more comforting than knowing you have no immediate <br/>
access.  Yes, it feels like rejection when he&#39;s not willing to give a <br/>
few minutes generously, but would it feel less like rejection if he <br/>
wasn&#39;t there at all?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not here to judge *anything;* I encourage you to think about <br/>
the &quot;big picture&quot; and not just the details.  Details pile up into big <br/>
heaps, but even the heaps don&#39;t block out the whole picture.  Back up <br/>
away from the piles and the heaps until you can see the giant picture.  <br/>
If you can see the entire horizon and can SEE the BETTER, then maybe <br/>
you can stay in the picture and find the better at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I would suggest is that giving this lifestyle a chance <br/>
and extending it to dh will probably, over time, bring some positive <br/>
changes as well.  Using your example, how would you have handled dh&#39;s <br/>
reaction if he was another child?  So often we get caught up in <br/>
expecting our partners to &quot;behave like adults&quot; (whatever that means) <br/>
that we fail to treat them as well as we do our children.  How would <br/>
you have handled it if dh was a child instead of dh?  Would following <br/>
him into the space he retreated into have seemed kind?  Mainstream <br/>
thinking expects that adults will be in control and that we &quot;train&quot; our <br/>
children to &quot;be in control.&quot;  That&#39;s not this lifestyle&#39;s goal.  The <br/>
goal is joyful living.  If you can possibly extend that generousity to <br/>
your dh and think in terms of helping *him* to feel better as well as <br/>
your dd, you&#39;ll be further on your way to BETTER.  I know it&#39;s a tough <br/>
mind change and requires a lot of generousity!  But as one person who <br/>
has BTDT, I can highly recommend it as worthwhile and as WAY BETTER <br/>
than I could have ever imagined when I started!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been on this life journey for 2 years now, and I can&#39;t even begin <br/>
to tell you how drastically different our marriage and family have <br/>
become through this life.  It&#39;s been really really hard at times -- and <br/>
I can tell you without a doubt that it&#39;s SO much BETTER because I made <br/>
the effort.  Many many weeks I felt like I shouldn&#39;t HAVE to give what <br/>
I gave... but that was the trick.  When I gave it because I wanted our <br/>
whole family to feel better and not because I HAD to then magic things <br/>
started to happen.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, I&#39;m not trying to talk you out of anything you know is right for <br/>
you and your family.  I&#39;m just sharing what my experience has been and <br/>
that truly LIVING this lifestyle and applying it to ALL members of the <br/>
family has brought gifts beyond my wildest dreams.  &quot;Generousity of <br/>
spirit&quot; is what I think was the key for me.  I felt like I was giving <br/>
and giving and getting nothing... but then after a while it started <br/>
coming back to me and now I can honestly say that I GET SO MUCH!  It&#39;s <br/>
been so worth it!<br/>
<br/>
All the best to you!<br/>

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
   <br/>
  This post speak very clearly to my situation.  I can *so* relate to all that has been shared in this thread!  Dh and I are going through a pretty rocky time , in fact just about every day I think about leaving, usually after yet another conflict that leaves me feeling pretty hopeless and exhausted about how things are between us right now.<br/>
   <br/>
  I have received the message so many times that &#39;if it is to be it is up to me&#39;, and MAN, do I hate hearing that!  I too have felt so often like I shouldn&#39;t have to give as much as I give, to the girls, to dh, and then I sit and think of the alternative.  Me committed to being home with the girls, dh not making enough to support 2 households, me being a single mama with no other adult in the house hardly at all, the girls missing their dad all the time, the message it would send to the girls about how hard we work for those we love, etc., these are all things that run through my mind.  I can love and hate that man in the space of 3 seconds it seems!<br/>
   <br/>
  And to be honest (and when I&#39;m being totally out of denial and blaming him), I see that I can be just a little challenging to be in relationship with too!!  It has helped me *immeasureably* to treat dh like a third child.  To apply the unschooling principles to him as well as to the girls.  To give him freedom.  To let him see what we&#39;re doing and work it out for himself.  I have no idea if it will come back to me yet, since I&#39;m still in the giving giving giving phase of all this.  I just wanted to encourage you as well to look at the big picture.  My dh was raised in a family where what was really going on was never mentioned, and it&#39;s a completely new thought to him (much to my amazement) that his childhood has anything to do with how he parents and is relationship now!  So he&#39;s beginning his journey, and we&#39;re along for the ride &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

BE KIND and to treat dh at least as well as I treated ds... then he <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-818098188">I&#39;m so looking forward to getting to &quot;this life is amazing!&quot;.  I still revert back to doing *way* too much talking with dh.  I believe the same, that unschooling our partners is a very key piece to having a joyful life.  Cuz clearly what I&#39;m doing with him *isn&#39;t* working!

Does anyone know of an instance where the roles in a situation like<br/>

primary childcare giver during the early years?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s simply that there are more wives/moms on these lists.<br/>
<br/>
I do know of a handful of husbands/dads that are either the <br/>
stay-at-home parents and/or the parents who &quot;get it&quot; more than their <br/>
wives, and their wives need the convincing. So if they were to share <br/>
here, they would probably be in that position. It&#39;s just that the <br/>
overwhelming majority here are moms.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not wild about considering treating Ben as &quot;another child&quot;---nor <br/>
would I appreciate it if he referred to me that way. &lt;g&gt; I look at it <br/>
as treating *all* members of our family as important and worthy and <br/>
valued. And yes, Ben treats me that way too. &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s that Golden Rule <br/>
thang.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes dads are so removed from the day-to-day goings-on because <br/>
they&#39;re simply not there---they&#39;re *literally* removed. To assume that <br/>
dads can understand and grasp this concept when absent (when some of <br/>
the moms who are working at it both online with us and at home with <br/>
their kids are having a very difficult time making changes) is a large <br/>
order! Treating them (our husbands) as whole and learning and wanting <br/>
the best for their kids too is a kind and generous way to go about it.<br/>
<br/>
We assume our children want to be the best people they can be, and by <br/>
treating them that way, they can&#39;t help but BE the best people they can <br/>
be. Why would treating our spouses the same way not work?<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately many come with some ugly baggage that is hard to shed. <br/>
But when they know we want the best for THEM too (and that it&#39;s not <br/>
always mom-&-the-kids against the dad), they&#39;re more likely to join us <br/>
on the journey.<br/>
<br/>
I know that Ben and I are better spouses---not just better <br/>
parents---due to this lifestyle/philosophy change.<br/>
<br/>
Just before finding unschooling, Ben and I attended Retrouvaille. I <br/>
cannot recommend it enough as far as saving our marriage. It&#39;s a <br/>
Catholic church thing, but they do NOT push the religion bit---I mean, <br/>
if *I* can attend it, *anyone* can! &lt;g&gt; Retrouvaille got us out of the <br/>
pit. Unschooling has allowed us to fly.<br/>

marriage hovering on the edge of divorce. I did not like the way he <br/>
was with the kids. I thought he was critical and not compassionate. I <br/>
thought he should try harder, do better. Do I sound a bit critical;]?<br/>
I thought he could potentially be endangering to their well <br/>
being.Plus I thought he was a jerk. <br/>
<br/>
After being seperated one Christmas and the kids seeing him part of <br/>
Christmas Day my daughter then nine said it was the worse Christmas <br/>
of her life. <br/>
<br/>
When hubby and I reconcilled things were still not perfect, but I <br/>
decided to be happy. I DECIDED TO BE HAPPY&gt; I decided to be the lover <br/>
of my children and the lover of my hubby.<br/>
<br/>
FF I am probably more in love with my dh than ever. I am glad my kids <br/>
do not have to travel between us. I am glad that it is me he is <br/>
married to and not someone else and visa versa. <br/>
<br/>
I still am a bit critical of him also of myself in the parenting <br/>
department. I am working on it. He sometimes is not the most <br/>
compassionate guy, but sometimes he really is GREAT!<br/>
<br/>
I am not telling you what to do, or advocating one way or the other. <br/>
I am just saying for us it got much, much better. <br/>
<br/>
The reasons that Kelly stated were ones that made me choose to stay <br/>

always going to be the wife/mother/woman in this position since she <br/>
is the primary childcare giver during the early years? &lt;<br/>
<br/>
My first thought after reading your question was, &quot;Of course, there <br/>
are millions of husbands who feel they have to treat their wives as <br/>
another child; just look at the number of overbearing, budget <br/>
controlling, domineering, bullying in the name of training <br/>
husbands.&quot;  In my childhood as well as in dh&#39;s it most certainly was <br/>
that way.  That was the expected behavior of the dad and husband.  <br/>
But on the other hand the &quot;expected&quot; behavior of the mom and wife was <br/>
to &quot;obey&quot; the &quot;man of the house&quot; and to live up to his expectations <br/>
and demands, while &quot;training&quot; the children to do the same.  Yuck!  <br/>
<br/>
My goal is to live a different kind of life.  I care passionately <br/>
about making that change, but dh, not so much yet.  He kind of liked <br/>
thinking that it was acceptable behavior to be the &quot;King of the <br/>
Household&quot; in much the same way that his father did.  When I learned <br/>
better, I did better.  *I* have to be the one to SHOW dh that it DOES <br/>
feel better when everyone is respected and valued and given real <br/>
validation and choice, and that means treating HIM that way as much <br/>
as any child.  It&#39;s really kind of crazy to think that just because I <br/>
found something that I think is &quot;better&quot; that he would <br/>
automatically &quot;get it&quot; and make a complete change based on no <br/>
personal experience.  He really didn&#39;t care a lot about what was <br/>
going on at home as long as HIS needs were being met.  But the thing <br/>
is that his needs WEREN&#39;T really being met because I was so resentful <br/>
and sarcastic and quick to internally condemn &quot;his selfishness&quot; that <br/>
he couldn&#39;t possibly feel safe or welcome, loved, or truly part of <br/>
the family.  The best meal really doesn&#39;t taste very good when served <br/>
with a big ol&#39; side of resentment.<br/>
<br/>
The thing about this lifestyle is that it&#39;s about EVERYBODY&#39;S needs <br/>
being met, and balancing that is quite the challenge when you&#39;re <br/>
learning something that&#39;s never been modeled.  So when I say that <br/>
I &quot;treat dh like another child&quot; what I mean is that I don&#39;t expect <br/>
him to behave any differently than he always has just because I <br/>
decided to change some things.  By &quot;treating him like a child&quot; I mean <br/>
extending to him the same freedom, support, choice, kindness, <br/>
forgiveness, respect and attention that I extend to ds.  It&#39;s the <br/>
backward but same thinking as, &quot;Would I treat dh/friend the way I am <br/>
treating my child?&quot;  I had some pretty lofty expectations that dh <br/>
would behave in the parental and spousal manner that I thought he <br/>
should, without showing him why or how.  I assumed a lot, and you <br/>
know about ass-u-me-ing....<br/>
<br/>
I believe that those who are capable are the ones who <br/>
should &quot;lead/show&quot; by example.  Right now in this situation I&#39;m the <br/>
one who is capable and wants to see the changes.  Therefore it IS up <br/>
to me to demonstrate WHY I believe this path is one worth walking.  I <br/>
can encourage or discourage my partner into joining me on this path <br/>
by how I choose to treat him.  I strive to make it a safe, <br/>
fulfilling, and enjoyable experience for all of us.  Sometimes it <br/>
means stepping back and seeing how far we&#39;ve come rather than how far <br/>
we still have to go.  It&#39;s not about &quot;being there&quot; but about finding <br/>
the good in each and every day.  Knowing that we are working <br/>
TOWARD &quot;better&quot; and keeping that at my center every day is what <br/>
sometimes keeps me going.  And it&#39;s worth it, especially in being <br/>
able to model &quot;better&quot; and striving for harmony for ds.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of people think, &quot;Well what about me?  Who is showing me <br/>
respect or consideration; who is meeting my needs?&quot;  To that I say <br/>
that my need for a peaceful and joyful family encompasses most every <br/>
other need I have.  If my family is FEELING the love they will be <br/>
capable of sharing the love.  It has to start somewhere, so if it is <br/>
to be then it has to start with me.  It doesn&#39;t come out of thin air, <br/>
it&#39;s something that has to be created.<br/>
<br/>
Pay it forward,<br/>

You say your husband is bipolar but you don&#39;t mention if he&#39;s<br/>
medicated.  My BIL is bipolar too and I know he had to have a lot of<br/>
fine tuning with his meds to get to a comfortable place.  Perhaps he<br/>
should see his MD or even a holistic practitioner for a &quot;tweek&quot; of his<br/>
meds?  I know my BIL swears by fish body oil for helping him stay on a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344471798">Yes, he&#39;s medicated - sort of... Very long story short - before he was <br/>
diagnosed with Leukemia, they had his meds fairly well balanced. <br/>
Unfortunately, through our research of causes of this particular type of <br/>
leukemia, we found out that the particular med combo he was on has a fairly <br/>
high risk of being one of the many causes.  Whether the cause is the <br/>
combination of drugs or the bipolar predisposing someone to immune issues is <br/>
a whole other debate.  At this point he uses Prozac and holistic measures to <br/>
remain balanced.  For the majority of the time it works out well.<br/>
    More than anything, most of our issues stem from his really crappy <br/>
childhood (alcoholism, drugs, physical & mental abuse) and old patterns that <br/>
seem to be resolved only to pop up again and again.<br/>
