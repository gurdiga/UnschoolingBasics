<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401077702">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
This is our first year homeschooling and I&#39;m learning more every <br/>
day, letting go a little every day and trying not to panic ~lol~ <br/>
every day.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to trust, for me. I was schooled in a school building, I <br/>
went to college for an education degree and my kids went to ps. At <br/>
this point, I CAN&#39;T let my son have all the screen time he&#39;d like. I <br/>
know I may get flamed for this but I&#39;m working on it. There are <br/>
limits at times. When my oldest starts watching tv, he canNOT stop. <br/>
At this point in my life, it upsets me too much to let it go all day <br/>
all night. I hope this group is open enough for me to be able to <br/>
ADMIT that without serious accusations of being inadequate or the <br/>
such.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m admitting to it because, in our lives, for the way I know my <br/>
oldest, I worry about his downward spiral when he feels out of <br/>
control and can&#39;t switch his behavior. This can be television <br/>
watching, gaming or raging... He has always had a difficult time <br/>
transitioning and NOT turning the tv on in the first place HELPS <br/>
him, in my opinion, and his. Other screen time seems easier for him <br/>
to eventually stop. The commercials for what&#39;s coming up next keeps <br/>
him glued and he can&#39;t get away. 4-5-6 hrs later .. My kids stay up <br/>
very late, sleep in, and thrive in the nighttime hours. They eat <br/>
when they&#39;d like, make many of their own choices about food, etc <br/>
etc. The tv thing is the biggest one right now, for us.<br/>
<br/>
So the point I was making is, I feel your pain regarding <br/>
homeschooling sometimes! Some days I feel like I&#39;ve made the biggest <br/>
mistake in the world. It doesn&#39;t happen often and there are more <br/>
times than not that I&#39;m forever grateful that they are home but <br/>
there are those days. :)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be at the Unschooling Convention in Peabody this weekend! It&#39;s <br/>
going to be a wild ride and I can&#39;t wait!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-764496706">After lurking and occasionally posting on these lists for a while I<br/>
have come to the following conclusion.  If it&#39;s a choice of limiting<br/>
one or two areas where you feel you absolutely must limit or chosing<br/>
to give up on the concept of unschooling completely, it&#39;s better to<br/>
limit what you feel you must.  However, any time you post about the<br/>
necessity of limiting a particular area, you should expect this list<br/>
(and others like it) to question that necessity.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t to say that you&#39;re a bad person/parent or whatever if you<br/>
feel you must limit TV or food (the most common areas).  However many<br/>
people on this list have found an amazing connection to and trust in<br/>
their children by being willing to re-evaluate their felt need to<br/>
control and limit.<br/>
<br/>
So, my suggestion for those who feel they&#39;d like to unschool but just<br/>
couldn&#39;t bear letting go of the controls in a few areas is this:  By<br/>
all means, take whatever stops toward unschooling you feel you can at<br/>
the moment.  But keep reading (and thinking about what you read) as it<br/>
relates to the areas that you feel you need to control.  It&#39;s quite<br/>
likely that in a few months or so you&#39;ll find that need to control is<br/>
disappearing.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably most of the people have something they aren&#39;t ready to let  <br/>
go of.<br/>
<br/>
But the list is to provide help and support for the practices someone  <br/>
*has decided they want to change* not the practices they want to hold  <br/>
onto.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately that gives the impression that everyone on the list is  <br/>
perfect, that it&#39;s easy to just let go of old ways and all they need  <br/>
is some tips on what to do instead!<br/>
<br/>
But I think a better way to look at the list is to picture everyone  <br/>
with a dozen practices they&#39;re holding onto that make their own life  <br/>
easier and less fearful. The practices are like balloons that support  <br/>
their fears because their fears are threatening to pull them into a  <br/>
bottomless abyss. They *want* to hold onto the balloons and they  <br/>
can&#39;t understand why people find it so easy to let go.<br/>
<br/>
It *isn&#39;t* easy to let go! It&#39;s scary! It takes some uncomfortable  <br/>
self examination to let go. But what you&#39;re seeing displayed on the  <br/>
list is the one balloon someone has decided to let go of. You&#39;re just  <br/>
not seeing the other 11 balloons they&#39;re still holding onto ;-)<br/>
<br/>
When people decide to let go, when they bring a practice to the list  <br/>
that they want help with, it isn&#39;t because it&#39;s easy. It&#39;s because  <br/>
they&#39;ve been examining that practice in a new light and they don&#39;t  <br/>
like the new vision. The new vision makes them more uncomfortable  <br/>
than the fear. One of their balloons doesn&#39;t look so comforting any  <br/>
more. They were only seeing the balloon part of the practice that was  <br/>
holding them up and supporting their fears, but now they&#39;ve seen the  <br/>
lead part that was weighing down their kids and holding themselves  <br/>
back. They&#39;ve reached the point with that practice where they&#39;ve  <br/>
said, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s scary to let go, but I can now see that where this  <br/>
balloon is taking me is even scarier. And I want help letting go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t assume that everyone has let go of all their balloons!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t assume that letting go is easy! You just haven&#39;t seen all the  <br/>
self-examination that has gone on in private as people read the list  <br/>
without posting. This is the list to post to when you&#39;ve decided to  <br/>
let go.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s also a good list to read to help you get to the point where  <br/>
you want to let go of a practice.<br/>
<br/>
It just isn&#39;t a good place to tell people why you aren&#39;t ready to let  <br/>
go ;-) Because everyone who posts regularly has let go of at least  <br/>
one balloon and is eager to help others let go of the ones they now  <br/>
see were weighing them down.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At<br/>
&gt; this point, I CAN&#39;T let my son have all the screen time he&#39;d like.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you&#39;re ready to work on that, it will help yourself *hugely* to  <br/>
see that you are *choosing* not to let him. You don&#39;t like the  <br/>
consequences (they *are* temporary consequences!) of letting him have  <br/>
all the screen time he&#39;d like. So you are *choosing* to limit.<br/>
<br/>
If there is one piece of advice I could give people it would be to  <br/>
see everything they do as a choice. It is so incredibly freeing :-)  <br/>
It seems like the only reason we do so many unpleasant things in life  <br/>
is because we don&#39;t have a choice. But it&#39;s the perception of not  <br/>
having a choice makes them doubly onerous.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, I hated cleaning the toilet. It was just something you  <br/>
had to do every week (or month ;-) And just because I had to do it, I  <br/>
never wanted to and fought against it, often avoiding my  <br/>
responsibility for 6 months! But when I realized it was a choice,  <br/>
that I could choose to never ever ever scrub the toilet again, I  <br/>
realized that it was nice to see it not filthy. I could choose --  <br/>
when I wanted to! -- to have a clean toilet. And I found that once I  <br/>
realized there wasn&#39;t anyone making me clean, that I cleaned it a lot  <br/>
more often.<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to let him have all the screen time he&#39;d like I promise  <br/>
you it will be hard! It will be hard to make the decision. It will be  <br/>
hard on you to let go of control over a piece of your life. It will  <br/>
be hard to see the new problems letting go creates. But the place on  <br/>
the other side on beyond this transition period where your son sees  <br/>
screen time as just another thing to do and not something precious to  <br/>
be coveted is a really awesome place :-) And it will be worth it.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s only when you have read enough to see that there&#39;s something  <br/>
better, when you&#39;ve reflected on the tension in the house and feel  <br/>
that tension doesn&#39;t seem a good enough compromise to prevent  <br/>
something that isn&#39;t seeming as scary as it once was, only then will  <br/>
you be one of the perceived &quot;perfect&quot; ones who posts to the list and  <br/>
says &quot;Okay, I&#39;ve let go, now what?&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I hope this group is open enough for me to be able to<br/>
&gt; ADMIT that without serious accusations of being inadequate or the<br/>

<br/>

type of list. Many people want places to vent, where they can air  <br/>
their faults and have others say &quot;Yes, I have that exact same  <br/>
problem. I know what you&#39;re going through because I&#39;m going through  <br/>
the same thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what support lists are for :-)<br/>
<br/>
This is a discussion list. It&#39;s a place to work out the things you&#39;ve  <br/>
decided to work on.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there are two types of people: People who want to work out  <br/>
their problems in private while getting support for how hard it is.  <br/>
And people who recognize that not being perfect is part of life and  <br/>
want a place to work on being better.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it&#39;s personality or school that causes people to think  <br/>
they&#39;re bad for not doing everything right? Probably personality but  <br/>
then school makes it worse :-/ But no one on the list sees anyone as  <br/>
bad for not doing everything &quot;right&quot;. No one expects everyone to be  <br/>
doing everything &quot;right&quot;.  Because there isn&#39;t &quot;right&quot; so much as  <br/>
there is actively working towards better, or moving towards  <br/>
unschooling instead of away. And the list is a place to work towards  <br/>
better. Any posts are assumed to be a request for help. It&#39;s the next  <br/>
step beyond &quot;Life&#39;s hard.&quot; That&#39;s why there isn&#39;t much support for  <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s hard,&quot; and &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; This type of list is the place to go when  <br/>
you want to ask &quot;So what do I do about that? How do I make it less  <br/>
hard. How do I move beyond &#39;I can&#39;t&#39;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I<br/>
&gt; know I may get flamed for this but I&#39;m working on it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not flames. It&#39;s help to move on! :-)<br/>
<br/>
The list is just not a support list where people can post about how  <br/>
hard life is and sympathize with each other.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, life&#39;s hard. Let&#39;s talk about the things we&#39;re ready to change  <br/>
so it&#39;s not so hard! :-)<br/>

Maybe we should have every new member read this! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

For those of you unfamiliar with Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s writings, she has a <br/>
wonderful website filled with pithy, helpful posts like this one. She <br/>
*so* understands unschooling---and more importantly, can plainly and <br/>
straight-forwardly put it into words. Her posts on the old <br/>
unschooling.com message boards and unschoolingdotcom e-lists (now <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@...">UnschoolingDiscussion@...</a>) were essential in helping me <br/>
take the leap.<br/>
<br/>
Her site should be one of your first stops (along with Sandra Dodd&#39;s) <br/>
on your journey into unschooling.<br/>

way to mark a reminder on programs you want to see later on. Find ways <br/>
that he can see what he wants when HE chooses rather than him being at <br/>
the beck and call of the TV programmer&#39;s schedule. Empower him to <br/>
watch what he wants when and for how long he chooses. For example, DS <br/>
(just about 8 yrs old) got to liking Fawlty Towers. But it comes on <br/>
late and sporadically. He was staying up really late to watch it - <br/>
later than he usually did and it was interfering with things he wanted <br/>
to do during the day - he&#39;d either miss other things or be tired and <br/>
irritable which none of us liked. So, we got a whole season of Fawlty <br/>
Towers on DVD (Netflix rental) and he watched and watched and watched. <br/>
We&#39;ll also set the digital reminder timers (he knows how to do that <br/>
himself) so that he can walk away or change to another program or <br/>
whatever and a reminder will pop up - if DH or I see a timer pop up, <br/>
we&#39;ll call DS and let him know - and he can choose to come and watch <br/>
or skip it. He&#39;s learned that *most* programs will repeat eventually.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>See you there! I usually write in my other screen name &quot;Bugsmom&quot; under <br/>
my real name on my nametag to differentiate me from all the <br/>
other &quot;Deb&quot;s that might be around. If you spot a 6 ft tall 350 lb <br/>
bearded long haired guy (probably doing cannonballs in the pool lol) <br/>
go say hi - that&#39;s my DH and the bundle of energy with him is DS.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-54979251"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Unfortunately that gives the impression that everyone on the list <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is perfect, that it&#39;s easy to just let go of old ways and all they <br/>
need is some tips on what to do instead!...... But I think a better <br/>
way to look at the list is to picture everyone with a dozen <br/>
practices they&#39;re holding onto that make their own life easier and <br/>
less fearful. The practices are like balloons that support their <br/>
fears because their fears are threatening to pull them into a <br/>
bottomless abyss. They *want* to hold onto the balloons and they <br/>
can&#39;t understand why people find it so easy to let go.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is great Joyce!   I love the balloon analogy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Don&#39;t assume that everyone has let go of all their balloons!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m still holding on to quite a few of my balloons!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  And just because I had to do it, I never wanted to and fought <br/>
 </span></blockquote>against it, often avoiding my responsibility for 6 months! But when <br/>
I realized it was a choice, that I could choose to never ever ever <br/>
scrub the toilet again, I  realized that it was nice to see it not <br/>
filthy. I could choose --  when I wanted to! -- to have a clean <br/>
toilet. And I found that once I realized there wasn&#39;t anyone making <br/>
me clean, that I cleaned it a lot more often.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have always been a procrastinator about things I felt I &quot;had to <br/>
do.  I know some of this stems back to when I was growing up and my <br/>
mother &quot;made&quot; me, or required me to clean my room, dust, etc, <br/>
whatever it was.   I think it was the way she demanded that I do it, <br/>
I stubbornly resisted.   You&#39;ve helped me look at this in a <br/>
different light.<br/>
<br/>
There are SO many good things in this post....I&#39;m saving it for <br/>
inspiration.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825943191">Firstly, Joyce,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you SO much! It makes SO much more sense now. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Probably most of the people have something they aren&#39;t ready to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>let  <br/>
go of.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can I say I believed that all/most of those in these groups were <br/>
100% unschooly pros??<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; It *isn&#39;t* easy to let go! It&#39;s scary! It takes some uncomfortable <br/>
 </span></blockquote>self examination to let go. But what you&#39;re seeing displayed on the  <br/>
 list is the one balloon someone has decided to let go of. You&#39;re <br/>
just not seeing the other 11 balloons they&#39;re still holding onto ;-)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Love this, thanks SO much!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But it&#39;s only when you have read enough to see that there&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>something  better, when you&#39;ve reflected on the tension in the house <br/>
and feel that tension doesn&#39;t seem a good enough compromise to <br/>
prevent something that isn&#39;t seeming as scary as it once was, only <br/>
then will you be one of the perceived &quot;perfect&quot; ones who posts to <br/>
the list and says &quot;Okay, I&#39;ve let go, now what?&quot; ;-)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to it. I guess I should give myself a SHRED of <br/>
credit. There is SO much that I have let go of and those balloons ;) <br/>
have drifted away. TV must be a bigger one ~for me~ and that&#39;s why <br/>
it&#39;s taking longer.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I have some confusion regarding the support vs. discussion <br/>
part when I see posts that eminate &quot;I need to... because of x&quot; <br/>
Sounds like looking for support to me. I&#39;ll keep working on that <br/>
with getting the semantics/reality straight.<br/>

hehehe... not... but it came way more comfortably to who I am at heart,<br/>
which is why it&#39;s been very easy to dive into for me... when challenged by<br/>
everyone here at the beginning, I didn&#39;t run and really let what they were<br/>
saying sink in, which helped to let go of those learned habits that were<br/>
hurting both me and my DD.  we have to unlearn to learn.<br/>

though that&#39;s what it&#39;s called.<br/>
<br/>
There is certainly support and encouragement for people who are  <br/>
trying to change here. And it&#39;s not that people aren&#39;t sympathetic to  <br/>
people who are clinging to their balloons. We&#39;ve all been there. But  <br/>
the list is focused on change. If someone says they won&#39;t/can&#39;t/don&#39;t  <br/>
want to change, there isn&#39;t much people can offer on this type of  <br/>
list where words are oriented towards encouraging people to push past  <br/>
the difficulties. To tell someone that it&#39;s okay to not change is  <br/>
discouraging to people who are going through the trials and  <br/>
tribulations of changing.<br/>
