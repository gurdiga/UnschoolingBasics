All unschoolers are homeschoolers, but all homeschoolers are not <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling falls under homeschooling laws. Some states are more <br/>
difficult to unschool AND homeschool in (NY & PA are awful, but <br/>
manageable).<br/>
<br/>
NHELD monitors homeschooling laws.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757729358">I joined HSLDA when I was contacted by a Quebec school board letting<br/>
me know that they were sending my case to child services. This was<br/>
after no contact from them after my formal withdrawal in which I<br/>
followed the guidelines they had set for withdrawal from school.  I<br/>
had to think hard about joining the HSLDA because quite a bit of their<br/>
philosophy doesn&#39;t jibe with mine but I was very worried and wanted<br/>
someone that appeared to have muscle on my side.  There was another<br/>
Quebec legal group that didn&#39;t respond to me so they were what I was<br/>
left with.  I have to say that I have not been disappointed. The<br/>
liaison has been very reassuring calling me with updates whenever<br/>
something has changed or they&#39;ve been contacted by the school board. <br/>
They&#39;ve handled all the letters and contact with the board since that<br/>
initial letter I&#39;ve received.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to point out that although they are not supportive of<br/>
unschooling and are a Christian organization, they have been helpful<br/>
to me so far.  I&#39;ll check out the NHELD.  I had not heard of them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316021071">H$LDA will NOT defend unschoolers in most cases (I&#39;ve had long email<br/>
correspondence with them a time or two). And, if you look at the<br/>
enrollment form, you are signing and agreeing to:<br/>
<br/>
By signing this application, we agree:<br/>

children.<br/>
* To keep records of each child&#39;s educational progress. <br/>

IMO that just doesn&#39;t square with unschooling - &quot;a clearly organized<br/>
program&quot;, uh yeah right. Keeping records is not required legally (my own<br/>
beef with them is that they &quot;suggest strongly&quot; that folks here follow<br/>
the &quot;Suggested Guidelines&quot; of the State Dept of Ed which are not law and<br/>
not required).<br/>

Because homeschooling (schooling too!) is not a federal issue, each <br/>
state has jurisdiction (some are county/city regulated though). So <br/>
most, if not all, states have some kind of regulatory &quot;group&quot; which <br/>
keeps an eye on the laws in its state.<br/>
<br/>
NHELD and H$LDA are the two national groups, but H$LDA has a <br/>
right-wing, reconstructionist, political agenda that should be <br/>
considered.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a yahoogroup---maybe someone knows the name off-hand----maybe <br/>
google &quot;homeschooling law yahoogroup&quot;? &lt;g&gt; I have a friend who was <br/>
*really* active on that group a few years ago. It may be NHELD&#39;s group??<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I think FL can be a lot easier than that. Like an umbrella school? I <br/>
know a bunch of FL unschoolers who don&#39;t do what all you&#39;ve described. <br/>
Any FL unschoolers want to chime in?<br/>
<br/>
I know there was a group here in SC that worked HARD to push the laws <br/>
to where we are now. They are always watch-dogging and sending us <br/>
updates whenever there&#39;s a new bill working its way through--both <br/>
positive and negative for homeschoolers. Often they have rallies at the <br/>
State House and send out petitions. But it&#39;s important to understand <br/>
*exactly* what you&#39;re signing/supporting &#39;cause some of the time, it&#39;s <br/>
the Christian Right School-at-Homers (doh!) wanting *more* regulations, <br/>
disguised as &quot;good for homeschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But as for a national *unschooling* watchdog group---no, not that I <br/>
know of. Homeschooling is legal in all 50 states, so technically <br/>
UNschooling is also legal in all 50 states.<br/>
<br/>
I do what *I* can to get the word out about unschooling as a good <br/>
option (the best! &lt;g&gt;), and I hope that as it becomes more and more <br/>
popular/common, it will just kind of smoothly float into mainstream. <br/>
It&#39;s gotten lots and lots of press recently---and GOOD press! Parents <br/>
are getting more and more disillusioned with the school system and are <br/>
looking for options. Unschooling is looking better and better!<br/>
<br/>
I used to say that I wish there were a stock option on unschooling: <br/>
homeschooling has grown sooo much these last ten years, and within <br/>
homeschooling, unschooling is ZIPPING along! &lt;g&gt; If I could have bought <br/>
stock when we first started, I would be one RICH bitch by now!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451680490">I&#39;m in Florida as well, and I&#39;ve decided, for simplicity&#39;s sake, to<br/>
enroll in an umbrella school.  In Florida we have several choices:  1. <br/>
never file your intent with your district, and basically have truant<br/>
kids.  I&#39;m not comfortable with this, but know several RU who are.  My<br/>
fear is that if they ever catch up with me and see that I don&#39;t<br/>
vaccinate, had a homebirth, . . . and am a RU, they might get child<br/>
services involved and start an ugly mess;  2.  you can file your intent<br/>
to homeschool and be required to keep records, get yearly evaluations .<br/>
. .  this is the only choice most homeschoolers in Florida are aware of<br/>
and therefore follow; or 3.  you can enroll your kids in a private<br/>
school.  Umbrella schools are private schools.  Here&#39;s a link to one<br/>
with a lot of info.:<br/>

<br/>
It is legal to unschool in Florida.  However, the legal group that<br/>
defends Florida homeschoolers through the FPEA will only defend if you<br/>
follow a curriculum.  Thus, if you run into a problem during an<br/>
audit/investigation (whatever you want to call it) you&#39;ll have to find<br/>
your own representation.<br/>
<br/>
My reasons for using an umbrella school are in large part due to my<br/>
jaded view of the government and their employees, especially when it<br/>
comes to education.  In addition, I find it time consuming, and quite<br/>
frankly just don&#39;t want, to translate our lives into pigeon-holes of<br/>
&quot;learning&quot; .  If I had to, I would.  For now, I&#39;m happy to be able to<br/>
enroll in an umbrella school and avoid the system&#39;s involvement in how<br/>
my children are learning.<br/>

really not necessary if you want to peacefully unschool. You can sign  <br/>
up with an umbrella school (600 school) and happily unschool free of  <br/>
any government ties at all.<br/>

unschooling - the answer is no. First, that would be a state-specific  <br/>
endeavor. Second, it would largely be a waste of time given the  <br/>
current mood in this society to in the opposite direction - toward  <br/>
more standards and more testing.<br/>
<br/>
If you mean helping people learn about and understand unschooling, you  <br/>
are talking to people who have devoted large amounts of their personal  <br/>
time to that endeavor through establishing unschooling groups, email  <br/>
lists, websites, publications, blogs, conferences, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
NHEN does have a media presence and does a considerable amount of work  <br/>
informing journalists and, to some degree, legislators and other  <br/>
public officials about the diversity of homeschooling styles,  <br/>
including unschooling. Our approach is to slowly get the idea across  <br/>
to the public that learning can happen in a wide variety of different  <br/>
ways and that homeschooling is not only the stereotype of mom sitting  <br/>
the kids down at the kitchen table to do their workbooks. We&#39;ve had  <br/>
success in that there has been a very clear shift in news stories -  <br/>
many more articles about unschooling and a lot fewer articles that  <br/>
make ignorant assumptions about homeschooling. NHEN doesn&#39;t usually  <br/>
get directly quoted in the articles, but we&#39;re almost always consulted  <br/>
by journalists and we provide lots of background information and we  <br/>
help journalists find real (and diverse) homeschoolers/unschoolers to  <br/>
interview.<br/>
<br/>
Many states have active state organizations that monitor proposed  <br/>
legislation and respond to it when they deem it appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A more direct involvement at the state level by a national  <br/>
organization would not be welcomed by the inclusive state  <br/>
organizations. The Christian organizations usually welcome HSLDA&#39;s  <br/>
involvement, but HSLDA has caused lots of problems over the years by  <br/>
getting involved at the state level.<br/>

Records can be as simple as attendance if you are registered  with an umbrella <br/>
school.  Even if you are registered under the county with  the public schools, it <br/>
is very easy to do a portfolio evaluation with an  evaluator that is familiar <br/>
with unschooling.  There is no submitting to  random testing or entrance into <br/>
your home or delivering your child  anywhere if you understand the <br/>
homeschooling laws.  <br/>

schools or unschooling in general in Florida.<br/>

Not necessarily - in FL you can use an umbrella (sometimes called a 600<br/>
school) and not deal with the school district at all, legally. There are<br/>
some that are about as restrictive as the districts but others simply<br/>
request that you email a monthly attendance log and that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
And you NEVER have to let ANYONE into your home without a bona fide<br/>
warrant. That doesn&#39;t need any additional laws, that&#39;s a Constitutional<br/>
protection.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-483807061">The wording of things can be confusing to me because they seem to <br/>
mean different things in different areas. In NC you have to register <br/>
yourself as either a private or religious school when you want to <br/>
homeschool even if you are only homeschooling your own children. I <br/>
can&#39;t remember all the specifics now because I haven&#39;t looked at the <br/>
law itself. The law does say that you have to meet all the same <br/>
requirements as a public school except for the safety requirements. <br/>
It reads as if you have to maintain lots of records and be ready for <br/>
an inspection any time. I&#39;ve been told, though, that that&#39;s not how <br/>
it actually works. I don&#39;t have to deal with it yet since my oldest <br/>
homeschooler is only 4 and they don&#39;t require anything until 7 years <br/>
of age. I&#39;m just trying to gather information. Additionally, we&#39;ll <br/>
most likely only be in this state for about a year after my oldest <br/>
homeschoolers reaches the age that we have to do anything.<br/>
