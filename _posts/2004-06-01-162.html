<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800827535">Hey!<br/>
Darn it all, I went away to Learnapalooza in Missouri for the <br/>
weekend, and when I came home all my unschool lists are homeschool <br/>
lists!  Ugh!<br/>
<br/>
SO, thanks, Deb Lewis, for steering me this way....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Dana, mom to Lauren, 11.5, and Emma, 6.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was in Kansas City :)  (PHEW!  QUITE A DRIVE FROM MONTANA!!!) It <br/>
was a bit light on unschooling, but there were some unschoolers and <br/>
that makes it 1000% better than than Montana convention ;)<br/>
<br/>
The group is LEARN (I don&#39;t remember what that stands for...) and <br/>
they are a secular homeschooling group from Kansas City...I am <br/>
looking for the address but not finding it yet....Anyone?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I don&#39;t know....I thought it would be more<br/>
unschooly, but in reality there were just two<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; workshops, actually one and a Q&A.  The<br/>
first workshop had only about 15 people in it, and it<br/>
was by Victoria Moran, who, although very nice,<br/>
thought that the TV was a demon box (I can never trust<br/>
a person who says that to *actually* be<br/>
unschooling--maybe it&#39;s just me ;).  The Q&A was full<br/>
of people who &quot;well, of course we can&#39;t trust our 13<br/>
year old home alone while we go to town....just think<br/>
what she might get into!&quot; and &quot;we have a TV, for after<br/>
the kids go to bed at night...&quot;  There were some<br/>
&quot;real&quot; unschoolers there, too, but it didn&#39;t feel like<br/>
they were as loudly voiced.  As for the other<br/>
speakers?  David Albert said things in his teen class<br/>
like &quot;You should have some sort of ceremony so that<br/>
your kids understand they have more say in their<br/>
education now as they get older....&quot;  In one class the<br/>
speaker said she &quot;got the kids up for school at<br/>
7&quot;....Maybe I&#39;m too overly sensitive (? been known to<br/>
happen!) but no, I would call this a secular<br/>
homeschooling convention with a few unschoolers thrown<br/>
in for good measure....But maybe others saw it<br/>
differently?  Kelly, I think you don&#39;t have to worry<br/>
about any competition just yet ;)  Until Deb and I get<br/>
the Montana Unschoolers conference off the ground :D<br/>
