<div id="ygrps-yiv-916874838">I am writing this knowing I won&#39;t be able to respond for about a week <br/>
hoping that when I get back from a business conference I will get <br/>
some great advice from you all, as always!!<br/>
<br/>
My parents are moving into our house (thankfully temporarily - about <br/>
2-3 months tops!).  This being said, for this amount of time we will <br/>
have the &quot;stress&quot; that comes with more adults and more parenting <br/>
styles.<br/>
<br/>
I try to respect my parents and, although I am the parenting head of <br/>
the house, I have always raised my children to listen to grandma and <br/>
grandpa if they are in charge.  Much to my chagrin, they use time-<br/>
outs and take away privileges more than I would, however, if I ask <br/>
them to be in charge while I am out, etc I feel I have to abide by <br/>
their methods.  Otherwise, I would (and sometimes do) hire a <br/>
babysitter that I pay for the services and can dictate how to take <br/>
care of my children.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my dilemma:<br/>
<br/>
Since my parents will be here more full-time, does anyone have any <br/>
suggestions as to how to handle things I disagree with when we are <br/>
doing things together.  For example, we do not make our children sit <br/>
at the table after they are finished eating but my parents make <br/>
comments and expect them to sit quietly and wait for everyone to <br/>
finish.  I realize I have the final decision, but sometimes it is ok <br/>
to be diplomatic, especially since they will be here ALL THE TIME!!<br/>
<br/>
Also, my mother and I have a very strained relationship.  My sister <br/>
died 5 years ago and my mother has never moved on to a different <br/>
level of emotion about this.  I, on the other hand, have come to <br/>
terms with it and am in a happy place now.  My mother resents this <br/>
from me, as well as she HATES that I homeschool.  She won&#39;t even have <br/>
conversations about it, nor does she attend 90% of the things we do <br/>
with the homeschool community.<br/>
<br/>
If I offend my mother, I get the silent treatment for DAYS!  After <br/>
giving birth to my third child she didn&#39;t speak to me on Christmas <br/>
Day because she disagreed with the turkey cooking time (no joke - <br/>
yes, she has issues!!!)<br/>
<br/>
So, with all that being said, I am taking the book &quot;Raising Our <br/>
Children, Raising Ourselves&quot; to finish reading and get some ideas, <br/>
but could use some practical advice or first-hand stories.  I won&#39;t <br/>
be rude to my parents and tell them it&#39;s my way or the highway.  I <br/>
value the relationship they have with the grandkids too much.  But, <br/>
maybe somebody has some ideas about how to handle things when we <br/>
disagree, especially considering that she is not supportive of my <br/>
lifestyle, homeschooling, letting the kids have freedom, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, chat with you all in a week!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484507940">Make a list of the specific things you can think of. Do this in advance <br/>
- not after they&#39;ve moved in. Be very specific - 1. Anyone, including <br/>
kids, can leave table when they decide to do so.<br/>
2. Anyone, including kids, can go to bed when they feel they are ready.<br/>
3. Nobody will be shut in their room as a punishment.<br/>
and so on....<br/>
<br/>
Make a long and detailed list - and post it somewhere, on the <br/>
refrigerator, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
You can call it &quot;House Rules&quot; even though it will really be a list of <br/>
&quot;House Unrules&quot; &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

Add things to it as they come up. Get your kids input.<br/>

Tell your parents you want everyone to get along well, so, to avoid <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-373380734">Hi Heather:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious to read what wisdom and insight and suggestions others <br/>
will come up with for you.  I really am -- because my first, and <br/>
maybe only -- response is entirely unhelpful, I&#39;m sure ... but is the <br/>
foremost question that comes up:  why are you inviting this pressure <br/>
cooker into your home?<br/>
<br/>
To me it sounds like conflict and resentment aren&#39;t probabilities -- <br/>
they&#39;re certainties.  My instinct says, given what you have <br/>
described, is to be VERY clear about &#39;discipline&#39; and parenting <br/>
decision boundaries with your parents BEFORE they move in <br/>
temporarily.  AND be VERY clear about the move out date.  I&#39;d talk <br/>
with the kids ahead of time, reviewing the possible conflicts that <br/>
might occur and strategize *with them* on how to handle uncomfortable <br/>
or heated moments when grandma wants something different from or <br/>
about them then what as a family you have established as a grounding.<br/>
<br/>
Given the volatility and immaturity of what you&#39;ve described, I&#39;d <br/>
much rather err on the side of being completely frank, (ie:  &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
not ok to try to shame our children into going to bed.  They stay up <br/>
as long as they want.  Period.  My children are &#39;allowed&#39; to leave <br/>
the table when they&#39;re done eating.  Period.  You will never, ever, <br/>
forcibly manhandle my children.  Period.  If you disagree with any of <br/>
our parental decisions, you can discuss with me, in private.  If you <br/>
are upset about any of those decisions, I want you to know I will <br/>
always invite an open conversation, rooted in loving respect, about <br/>
how and why we came to them.  I appreciate that you have a right to <br/>
your opinions.  I&#39;ll ask you to appreciate the same about me.&quot;) ahead <br/>
of moving in, and possibly in that frankness earning a passive <br/>
agressive sulk from your mother than try to establish the boundaries <br/>
once their already inside them, where there might be perceived more <br/>
lattitude than you&#39;re comfortable with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-306393230">Cindy,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
First of all - thanks to everyone for their helpful insight.  Everyone seems to be saying be CLEAR about expectations and I am in the process of drawing up some rules for all to follow and posting them.  This should help immensely.  I have also had a few conversations with my oldest two about respecting each adult individually but that mommy and daddy are their parents and they can continue to follow our house &quot;rules&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To answer your question, my father quit his job in order to help my husband open up his second restaurant.  It is something my father has been excited about (like a 16 year old with a new car) for the past year and since the reality is going to happen in two months, he wants to be helping from the get-go.  My father quit his full-time job and took a hefty pay cut to do this, but it has been his dream and desire for the past year, and we are just as happy about it as he is.  He will be a FABULOUS help for the future of our business.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Because my father took this pay cut and still has a house in his hometown, we offered to let them live in our rental property for free.  We would still continue to pay the mortgage but not charge them.  This will stretch us somewhat financially, but not to any breaking point.  Our current renters are only paying about 1/2 the rent right now and at least with my parents there we know the property will be taken care of.  We don&#39;t want to sell the house in this economy and haven&#39;t needed to yet.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Since we have renters in our house, we have to give them 60 days notice due to our contract.  Then there will need to be a few weeks to get it back in shape.  This is the reason why my parents are moving in with us.  Probably not the single best idea for us, but they still have a house payment and we cannot afford to pay our house, the rental and an apartment or hotel, too.  My mother cannot be left alone for too many days because of her physical (and I would say mental) condition, so my father will not let her live in their old house until it sells because he doesn&#39;t trust her to be able to take care of herself properly (she has earned this lack of trust based on some previous actions of not taking care of herself and landing in the hospital).  Luckily, about the move out date, they will be ready to move out as soon as the house is ready, so that won&#39;t be an issue.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Today was the first day back from my trip and it went smoothly, however, my husband took the day off, so that helped.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that is my situation in a nutshell.  I really appreciate the wisdom everyone has given me - especially that I should be prepared for this to be volatile.  I think I knew that but by hearing other people say it, now I REALLY know it!!  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Since we have renters in our house, we have to give them 60 days <br/>

to get it back in shape.  This is the reason why my parents are <br/>
moving in with us.  Probably not the single best idea for us, but <br/>
they still have a house payment and we cannot afford to pay our <br/>
house, the rental and an apartment or hotel, too.  My mother cannot <br/>
be left alone for too many days because of her physical (and I would <br/>
say mental) condition, so my father will not let her live in their <br/>
old house until it sells because he doesn&#39;t trust her to be able to <br/>
take care of herself properly (she has earned this lack of trust <br/>
based on some previous actions of not taking care of herself and <br/>
landing in the hospital).  Luckily, about the move out date, they <br/>
will be ready to move out as soon as the house is ready, so that <br/>
won&#39;t be an issue.<br/>

&gt; Hi Heather:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m curious to read what wisdom and insight and suggestions others <br/>
&gt; will come up with for you. I really am -- because my first, and <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; To me it sounds like conflict and resentment aren&#39;t probabilities --<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; they&#39;re certainties. My instinct says, given what you have <br/>
&gt; described, is to be VERY clear about &#39;discipline&#39; and parenting <br/>
&gt; decision boundaries with your parents BEFORE they move in <br/>
&gt; temporarily. AND be VERY clear about the move out date. I&#39;d talk <br/>
&gt; with the kids ahead of time, reviewing the possible conflicts that <br/>
&gt; might occur and strategize *with them* on how to handle <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Given the volatility and immaturity of what you&#39;ve described, I&#39;d <br/>
&gt; much rather err on the side of being completely frank, (ie: &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
&gt; not ok to try to shame our children into going to bed. They stay up <br/>
&gt; as long as they want. Period. My children are &#39;allowed&#39; to leave <br/>
&gt; the table when they&#39;re done eating. Period. You will never, ever, <br/>
&gt; forcibly manhandle my children. Period. If you disagree with any of <br/>
&gt; our parental decisions, you can discuss with me, in private. If you <br/>
&gt; are upset about any of those decisions, I want you to know I will <br/>
&gt; always invite an open conversation, rooted in loving respect, about <br/>
&gt; how and why we came to them. I appreciate that you have a right to <br/>
&gt; your opinions. I&#39;ll ask you to appreciate the same about me.&quot;) <br/>

&gt; &gt; some great advice from you all, as always!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My parents are moving into our house (thankfully temporarily - <br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt; &gt; 2-3 months tops!). This being said, for this amount of time we <br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; &gt; have the &quot;stress&quot; that comes with more adults and more parenting <br/>
&gt; &gt; styles.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I try to respect my parents and, although I am the parenting head <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt; the house, I have always raised my children to listen to grandma <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; grandpa if they are in charge. Much to my chagrin, they use time-<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Here is my dilemma:<br/>

&gt; sit <br/>
&gt; &gt; at the table after they are finished eating but my parents make <br/>
&gt; &gt; comments and expect them to sit quietly and wait for everyone to <br/>
&gt; &gt; finish. I realize I have the final decision, but sometimes it is <br/>
&gt; ok <br/>
&gt; &gt; to be diplomatic, especially since they will be here ALL THE <br/>
 </span></blockquote>TIME!!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, my mother and I have a very strained relationship. My <br/>

&gt; &gt; level of emotion about this. I, on the other hand, have come to <br/>
&gt; &gt; terms with it and am in a happy place now. My mother resents this <br/>
&gt; &gt; from me, as well as she HATES that I homeschool. She won&#39;t even <br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt; conversations about it, nor does she attend 90% of the things we <br/>
 </span></blockquote>do <br/>

&gt; &gt; If I offend my mother, I get the silent treatment for DAYS! After <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Day because she disagreed with the turkey cooking time (no joke - <br/>
&gt; &gt; yes, she has issues!!!)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, with all that being said, I am taking the book &quot;Raising Our <br/>
&gt; &gt; Children, Raising Ourselves&quot; to finish reading and get some <br/>
 </span></blockquote>ideas, <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; be rude to my parents and tell them it&#39;s my way or the highway. I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075428981">oooh! I&#39;m glad this resurfaced :) I was just thinking the other day: How<br/>
about she just tells them they&#39;re here to grand-parent and all parenting<br/>
should be left to the parents?  So there&#39;s my advice :)<br/>
Tell them they&#39;re welcome to do all those gramma/grampa things they&#39;ve<br/>
always dreamed of doing with the kids -- no fussy parental buzzkill, just<br/>
g-parent fun, fun, fun!! :D<br/>

&gt; First of all - thanks to everyone for their helpful insight. Everyone seems<br/>
&gt; to be saying be CLEAR about expectations and I am in the process of drawing<br/>
&gt; up some rules for all to follow and posting them. This should help<br/>
&gt; immensely. I have also had a few conversations with my oldest two about<br/>

fun things to do together.<br/>

Maybe find some kind of really sweet description of what a <br/>

house, too.<br/>
