<div id="ygrps-yiv-940135721">Hi!  My name is Sandra & I just started homeschooling my 8-year old son<br/>
this year.  I also switched my daughter to a private school for 6th<br/>
grade, after 6 years of public school.<br/>
<br/>
We started out with a comprehensive instruction plan, but I&#39;m finding<br/>
that we&#39;re enjoying going off on tangents.  Right now all three of us<br/>
are enjoying (and learning from) creating blogs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to learning from you how to make unschooling work. <br/>
I would also welcome your comments on my blog at Living By Learning<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025579126">Hi Sandra, I&#39;m Meredith, mom to &quot;always unschooled&quot; Morgan (6) and <br/>
stepmom to Rayan (14) who has lived and unschooled with us for <br/>
almost a year. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great! I&#39;ve had some of my best life experiences going off on <br/>
tangents... in a sense my life now started as a tangent - the clutch <br/>
on my car failed and I ended up moving to the place I was stranded. <br/>

<br/>
Oh, lots of grand sweeping concepts like Trust and Patience and <br/>
Unconditional Love - real helpful, huh? &lt;sneaky grin&gt; Feel free to <br/>
ask any questions you may have, rummage through the archives and <br/>
links or just read along. You&#39;ll start to notice pretty quickly, <br/>
though, that even for a lot of really specific questions <br/>
the &quot;answers&quot; are often along the lines of &quot;change your <br/>
perspective/expectations&quot;. Most of the &quot;work&quot; of unschooling from <br/>
the parenting side happens inside your head.<br/>
