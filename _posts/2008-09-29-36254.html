<div id="ygrps-yiv-819227334">Hello,<br/>
I have been a member for several months and gotten a lot out of<br/>
reading posted questions and feedback. I often have lots of questions,<br/>
but I will start with two.<br/>
1) Has anyone read the book, &quot;Reviving Ophelia?&quot; A friend recently<br/>
lent it to me and said it was good. I thought I would read it because<br/>
my oldest is a 9 y/o girl. I barely started reading it and found it to<br/>
be a bit depressing about adolescent girls developing self destructive<br/>
behaviors. I am just curious if anyone else has any feedback about it.<br/>
I am trying to decide whether there is good information in it and to<br/>
continue reading it, or not. <br/>
2) The other night my kids (9 y/o girl, 6 y/o boy) wanted to watch TV<br/>
in the evening. It was 8pm and I thought primetime was pretty kid<br/>
friendly, most nights seem to be. Anyway, there wasn&#39;t much on so they<br/>
chose &quot;Ugly Betty.&quot; We have never seen it before. During the half hour<br/>
that we watched it I was uncomfortable with some of the content. There<br/>
was a seen with a young couple on the couch half naked as if they just<br/>
had sex. Then his cell phone rings and he looks at it and says, &quot;It&#39;s<br/>
my wife.&quot; Then he decides not to answer it. <br/>
Another frequent seen was of a magazine office called &quot;Player&quot; which<br/>
had a lot of women walking around the office that were barely clothed.<br/>
The part that bothered me the most was when a young woman wearing very<br/>
revealing clothes (short shorts, and skimpy shirt) walked into a room<br/>
the men would cheer. When ugly Betty walked into a room the men would<br/>
boo. I finally said I thought it was a show for adults and I asked if<br/>
we could turn it off. My kids reluctantly agreed and we went off and<br/>
played together. I later told my dtr that I didn&#39;t like the way the<br/>
show made women seem like sex objects and that it gave the impression<br/>
that you have to look a certain way in order for people to like you.<br/>
Does anyone have any feed back about the way I handled this. Should I<br/>
let my kids watch shows like this? How do other people handle<br/>
situations like this?<br/>

better understanding of what *I* went through as an adolescent. I have an 11<br/>
1/2dd who has never exhibited any self-destructive behavior. She is still<br/>
very much herself. She has retained all her sparkle and most of her<br/>
authenticity. i say most only because she is trying on different &quot;hats&quot;<br/>
right now and feeling out the teenage social circles and exploring their<br/>
games. She has her head on straight and wouldn&#39;t let anyone talk her onto<br/>
something she doesn&#39;t wanna do (even me). I don&#39;t  think the adolescent<br/>
years *need* to be as they are described by those girls. It is only common<br/>
experience in the mainstream.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would have (and I do) say things like that to my kids all the time at that<br/>
moment. We might even pause the show to discuss things. My kids will usually<br/>
say things like that while watching a show. Sometimes if no one is watching<br/>
with them we will talk about it later.<br/>
fyi I have a 11dd 5 ds and a 1dd. All of them can watch whatever they want,<br/>
whenever. However that doesn&#39;t mean that they watch in a vacuum. I will<br/>
sometimes watch with them or just be around while they are watching.<br/>

deeply about the causes of the problems she talks about and how to  <br/>
avoid creating those problems in your own family.<br/>
<br/>
Follow up with her second book, &quot;The Shelter of Each Other.&quot; It is an  <br/>
antidote to the first. Includes a homeschooling family as an example.<br/>

if all the kids at school were participating in today&#39;s culture (TV,<br/>
movies etc.) and your children weren&#39;t. Well, then technically they<br/>

Reading and Shakespeare does not make one &quot;cultured&quot; in the way you<br/>
mean it.  It makes them interested in reading and Shakespeare.  I&#39;m<br/>
not into Shakespeare.  Does that make me culturally deprived?</div>

 </span></blockquote>First, kids don&#39;t see the adult interaction the same way adults do.  <br/>
They aren&#39;t seeing that scene and saying &quot;Oh, casual sex! Must be  <br/>
okay if mom&#39;s showing it to me.&quot; &quot;Oh, cheating on his wife. People  <br/>
laughed so it must not be serious.&quot; Unless they&#39;re very precocious in  <br/>
interpersonal relationships, they&#39;re probably just waiting for a joke  <br/>
they get. So I doubt they picked up what you did from it and they  <br/>
aren&#39;t scarred for life.<br/>
<br/>
Second, it doesn&#39;t have much kid humor in it so it&#39;s not something  <br/>
that kids would normally choose to watch. That&#39;s not a criticism,  <br/>
just that parents tend to worry that there&#39;s something magnetic about  <br/>
adult programs that kids will naturally drift to if they&#39;re given  <br/>
free rein. It just isn&#39;t true. They no more drift to adult programs  <br/>
than they do the adult section of the bookstore or library.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I later told my dtr that I didn&#39;t like the way the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My guess is that this was said with some tension because you were  <br/>
trying to undo any positive message about values you don&#39;t agree with  <br/>
that the program might have placed in her head. And that may have  <br/>
called more attention to it than she had paid to it originally.  <br/>
You&#39;re tension may have actually intrigued her.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. I think what will help is if you pass on  <br/>
your comments as you might to a friend, rather than as a lessons you  <br/>
want to get into them to negate something they&#39;ve seen. It&#39;s more  <br/>
honest to say &quot;I&#39;m not really enjoying the humor in this. I think I&#39;d  <br/>
like to play a game. Anyone want to join me?&quot; Make it about you  <br/>
rather than about them. Be okay if they&#39;d rather watch. Ask what  <br/>
they&#39;re finding funny. I doubt it&#39;s the same things adults are  <br/>
finding funny!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should I<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do they want to?<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s the central question parents often fail to ask! Rather  <br/>
than seeing the world divided into what you want them to see and what  <br/>
you don&#39;t want them to see, divide the world into what interests them  <br/>
and what doesn&#39;t (yet) interest them. They want to avoid the things  <br/>
that don&#39;t yet interest them! I&#39;m sure Ugly Betty isn&#39;t high on their  <br/>
list of what interest them.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re often faced with not having something to watch, you might  <br/>
try Netflix. (I think there lowest rate is $5 a month.) Or a  DVR so  <br/>
you can record their favorite shows and time shift them to the times  <br/>
you&#39;re available to watch. (VCR tapes work too, of course! I had  <br/>
loads of episodes taped from TV when Kat was young.) Or keeping a  <br/>
selection from the library. Shop library sales and movie rental place  <br/>
sales for movies and shows they would like to see. (Netflix often  <br/>
puts their excess inventory up on eBay very cheap.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And unschooling parents shouldn&#39;t be seeing TV (or books or movies)  <br/>
as things to teach children good values.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;d like to pass on our values, we should live them and use them  <br/>
in our daily lives. I think a hard part to grasp is that if we value  <br/>
certain adult relationships (like no casual sex) that&#39;s not any easy  <br/>
one for kids to see from us, so how will we pass it on? So how do we  <br/>
express something like that?<br/>
<br/>
Through discussions of relationships on TV. *Not* the &quot;I think that  <br/>
was wrong&quot; kind of value judgement, but closer to &quot;I don&#39;t think her  <br/>
choice made her very happy. I think she would have been happier if  <br/>
she&#39;d done x. What about you? What do you think she should have  <br/>
done.&quot; And really listen to their ideas. Don&#39;t worry if they don&#39;t  <br/>
match yours.<br/>
<br/>
In these cases it&#39;s often easier to step back from the protecting mom  <br/>
role and step into a friend role. Don&#39;t project their right now ideas  <br/>
into the future and worry that you need to nip them in the bud! Trust  <br/>
that they&#39;re thinking creatures and *if* your values are good ones,  <br/>
the kids will come to that conclusion too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; typically<br/>
&gt; only let them watch things like The Brady Bunch and Little House on<br/>
&gt; the Prairie.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it makes sense to show kids only the values that we value.  <br/>
That way they absorb the right way to think.<br/>
<br/>
But people aren&#39;t so simple. If we could learn the right way to be  <br/>
just by being told, humanity wouldn&#39;t be having so many problems and  <br/>
schools would work like a charm!<br/>
<br/>
We learn by seeing what&#39;s good in the bad and what&#39;s bad in the good  <br/>
and weighing and judging what we&#39;d like for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter and I have had much richer discussions about Simpsons and  <br/>
South Park and her current obsession -- 80&#39;s hair metal. Since she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have anything to rebel against --- like a parent who controls  <br/>
what she can and can&#39;t see -- she can objectively observe the  <br/>
excessive behavior and shake her head and see the humor in it. But  <br/>
also see that it&#39;s not for her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My kids used to come home from school saying that they<br/>

yes, they *were* culturally deprived. Still are, apparently unless  <br/>
you&#39;ve transported them back to the 70s.<br/>
<br/>
Shakespeare was meant to appeal to the highest and lowest of the  <br/>
population. It has some incredibly low brow humor, cruder than kids  <br/>
will get on a lot of TV! But that&#39;s not going to give them something  <br/>
to talk about with their peers unless their peers are living in the  <br/>
1400s.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-627901895">~~ It&#39;s definitely not appropriate for teaching children good values.<br/>

<br/>
Children don&#39;t learn values from tv or books. They have an internal<br/>
guide and they are influenced by their environment. But even their<br/>
parents values won&#39;t automatically be passed on to them. Hopefully<br/>
not. Because values that aren&#39;t digested, reflected, analyzed and<br/>
viewed from many angles aren&#39;t true values at all, they&#39;re just<br/>
mimicry. I want my kids to figure out their own values system, so that<br/>
it truly belongs to them.<br/>
<br/>
~~In our home,we preview shows before we show them to our children and<br/>
typically only let them watch things like The Brady Bunch and Little<br/>
House on the Prairie. ~~<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s control. It isn&#39;t very conducive to natural learning or trust,<br/>
which is the crux of unschooling in my opinion. <br/>
<br/>
My parents decided that tv was a bad thing in general, so we didn&#39;t<br/>
have one. <br/>
They thought that eating meat was good and healthy for growing children.<br/>
They thought that our church was the one &quot;right&quot; and &quot;true&quot; Christian<br/>
church.<br/>
They believed that women should not wear much (or any) makeup and be<br/>
&quot;modest&quot; by wearing dresses all the time.<br/>
My Mom was a teacher and later a librarian that thought school was<br/>
important for children.<br/>
<br/>
All of their children own more than one television.<br/>
Two of their children are vegetarians.<br/>
None of their children are Christians and some of us are agnostic.<br/>
All the girls wear makeup and I am a professional makeup artist. We<br/>
all wear funky and/or trendy clothing and rarely in the form of a<br/>
dress. None of us are particularly modest.;)<br/>
One of my sisters and myself are radical unschoolers and one other<br/>
sister sees right through the school system&#39;s issues, and believes her<br/>
child could learn just fine without a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
So how did their values play out in our lives? A lot of them didn&#39;t.<br/>
Now their work ethic and some of those examples stayed with us. The<br/>
stuff they didn&#39;t make a big deal over, or try to control us about. We<br/>
seemed to absorb some of that stuff. Family connections and rituals.<br/>
Work habits, etc... That stayed with us. But NONE of the things they<br/>
were controlling about ended up being something we valued. None of it.<br/>
So you&#39;re taking a big risk by choosing what SHOULD be valuable to<br/>
your children. They will decide for themselves one day and all control<br/>
does is damage relationships.<br/>
<br/>
~~My kids used to come home from school saying that they are<br/>
culturally deprived because all the other children at school<br/>
watched lots of tv and then spent most school time discussing it.~~<br/>
<br/>
It makes for great discussions. I remember feeling SO stupid around my<br/>
friends because they were all &quot;culturally literate&quot; about current pop<br/>
culture and I was not! I hated it. It took me years of not being able<br/>
to ignore a tv if it was on, to get over my obsession because it was<br/>
controlled for so much of my life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 ~~So we pulled them from that school and now they spend their time<br/>
reading and going to Shakespeare plays instead.  Who is really<br/>
culturally deprived here?~~<br/>
<br/>
Depends. If they want/love Shakespeare and books then they are being<br/>
filled up with what they love. If they want/love some of the tv shows<br/>
you are limiting, then they are culturally deprived.<br/>
<br/>
Deprivation and abundance are all about our own perception. YOu can&#39;t<br/>
change what they want. You can only hinder them or enable them.<br/>

It&#39;s about the Purity movement based in Colorado Springs and how these daughters of these fathers are signing up to be virgins until they are married. We had the best conversations about sex and premarital sex and how many sexual partners I&#39;ve had and why I think premarital sex is a good thing, certainly not a bad thing.

Television is a fantastic conversation starter. We watch a fair bit of Family Guy and American Dad and other shows that have controversal themes.

My dad once questioned me allowing Linnaea to watch the My Humps video by The Black Eyed Peas because it degraded women, he said.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865644001">Thank you for these great stories.  I raised my kids like this, too, discussing topics as life presented them.  My first born is now an adult and doing rather well in life.  She makes great choices because she thinks about those choices.  She&#39;s even won the respect of many adults in the professional world and is being sought after for employment with a few local cities. (She&#39;s just graduated from the Fire/EMT Academy.) I don&#39;t see how I could have raised a sweeter, kinder, and smarter young lady.  I, also, don&#39;t think I did much more then try and let her live the life she desired.  Life is to short and childhood even shorter to make absurd rules. Afterall, why have children in the first place if you don&#39;t plan on letting them live the best and most wonderful life you can?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847758393">She has retained all her sparkle and most of her authenticity. i say most only because she is trying on different &quot;hats&quot; right now and feeling out the teenage social circles and exploring their games. She has her head on straight and wouldn&#39;t let anyone talk her onto something she doesn&#39;t wanna do (even me). I don&#39;t  think the adolescent years *need* to be as they are described by those girls. It is only common experience in the mainstream.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
It sounds like trying on different hats is part of your daughter&#39;s authenticity at this point in her journey.  She is being authentic to her own path, even tho it may look to you like she&#39;s playing games.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926288107">It&#39;s definitely not appropriate for teaching <br/>
children good values.  But then again, almost no tv is.  In our home, <br/>
we preview shows before we show them to our children and typically <br/>
only let them watch things like The Brady Bunch and Little House on <br/>
the Prairie.  My kids used to come home from school saying that they <br/>
are culturally deprived because all the other children at school <br/>
watched lots of tv and then spent most school time discussing it.  So <br/>
we pulled them from that school and now they spend their time reading <br/>
and going to Shakespeare plays instead.  Who is really culturally <br/>
deprived here? <br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
Your kids are really culturally deprived.<br/>
I watched The Brady Bunch and Little House on the Prarie and Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley and Gilligan&#39;s Island and Bewitched and All in the Family and lots and lots of other shows. Those were the shows of my time and a bit earlier. Gilligan&#39;s Island and The Brady Bunch and Bewitched were all on after school on some rotation where each was available for some period of time and then the next.  I watched other shows, too. My parents were quite keen to not limit my media experience. They used to take me to R rated movies when I was young to broaden my horizons. I saw Everything You Wanted to Know about Sex but Were Afraid to Ask when I was too little to remember what it completely and would ocassionally ask what the movie was with a giant boob rolling around. Nobody could tell me.  Although they were loathe to get cable when it came out and I had to fill that desire with the cable at the homes where I babysat. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I wasn&#39;t culturally deprived because I lived fully within my culture. Part of the culture of my childhood was television. It was knowing all about Luke and Laura on General Hospital and Chachi and Joanie and The Greatest American Hero and going from listening to Bill Cosby comedy albums and 500 children on gocarts going down the hill to  Eddie Murphy and ice creams and Steve Martin singing about King Tut. And because of all of those things I was able to talk with my friends about ideas and approaches to humor and to have common references. I was also able to discover what I liked and to have a taste for my own culture. I could not like &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and like &quot;Rock n Roll High School&quot;. Because I was wealthy in cultural experiences I could pick and choose what I most enjoyed. <br/>
<br/>
By limiting your children to culture that has a range from 500 to 25 years ago you are limiting their ability to communicate with other people and to judge for themselves variations between television shows.  And other countries. That&#39;s so cool. I love watching the way that tension is built up and released in Japanese movies, it is done at a very different pace to U.S. or U.K. movies. That&#39;s true historically as well. Watching the old Parent Trap versus the remake. The concerns about being loved by both parents, the change in the culture of divorce.  Wonderful things to talk about. Remakes are fascinating things. <br/>
<br/>
My parents-in-law have insulated themselves against the cultures in which they lived. They were very specific in their cultural approach. They lived in Oman and in Pakistan and in Hong Kong and the Phillipines to name a few places and in all of those places they worked hard not to let the regional culture touch them. They wanted to remain as British as they possibly could. They had staff who were required to maintain things as would be normal for a British household, breakfast at 8, coffee at 11, lunch at 1, tea at 4, dinner at 7 with the  required meat and two vegetables. David loved to hide out in the kitchen with his Amah and the cooks.  The food was so much better there, where the cook was cooking the food he or she knew, rather than the recipes that David&#39;s mom required, and David loved listening to the language flowing around him. When they lived in Sri Lanka and he came back for Christmas break he got the cook to serve him a different fruit every<br/>
 morning for breakfast. Something that his parents would never have done.  They wanted a wall between themselves and the world they lived in. A wall that let them hold on to their sense of being British. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a similar wall that you are erecting between your children and the culture at large. Have you expanded out from the shows you allow? Having children who aren&#39;t versed in the Brady Bunch, Simon and Linnaea don&#39;t really appreciate The Brady Bunch movies. I imagine your children would be able to enjoy the heck out of the humorous look back. And it might get you thinking about living a life that is out of sync with the world around you. <br/>

&gt; It makes for great discussions. I remember feeling SO stupid around my<br/>
&gt; friends because they were all &quot;culturally literate&quot; about current pop<br/>
&gt; culture and I was not! I hated it. It took me years of not being able<br/>
&gt; to ignore a tv if it was on, to get over my obsession because it was<br/>
&gt; controlled for so much of my life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never felt deprived growing up. We never had a TV until I was 12 or 13. I<br/>
lived in an impoverished neighborhood and no one had TVs so it just didn&#39;t<br/>
matter. However, my dh was deprived because his parents heavily control the<br/>
TV, the amount viewed and the content. The deference was our person<br/>
perspectives on TV.<br/>
<br/>
For years I never questioned the common conception that TV is &quot;bad&quot; and will<br/>
make you stupid. I just didn&#39;t have one. I didn&#39;t supply one for my dd. She<br/>
loved TV and I kept it from her. I did it because I thought it was the right<br/>
thing to do. I hadn&#39;t questioned that yet. When she was 5 a friend left his<br/>
TV in our house when he moved out. We had free cable. It turned into a<br/>
control issue between me and dd. I hadn&#39;t questioned the validity of my<br/>
argument. I was afraid that she would turn into a stupid american.<br/>
<br/>
My dh came into our life around the same time as TV. Becuase of his<br/>
childhood experience he helped me move into a more open space with TV. We<br/>
gradually came to let it go. We wanted our children to be themselves, and<br/>
happy. TV made Malila happy, she loves TV/movies. So now our kids have<br/>
unlimited access (for lack of better terms) and have for years. There is no<br/>
issues over it. They can discuss cartoons, anime, or books. It is all the<br/>
same.<br/>
OK, I wrote this with the kids all playing and talked and needing so I hope<br/>
that it is clear enough.<br/>

and manhole covers, kind of thing. Also had a performance of Romeo and <br/>
Juliet that was fun - the company was just 6 or 7 people, mixed male <br/>
and female. At the start of the show, they went into the audience with <br/>
a bag. In the bag were slips of paper with the names of the various <br/>
characters writ on them. Some had multiple names (for characters with <br/>
smaller roles). Each actor had to perform whatever role(s) the person <br/>
drew for them - so a big burly guy ended up being Juliet&#39;s nurse and a <br/>
lovely blonde young lady ended up being Romeo&#39;s father and so on. Every <br/>
performance, the roles changed - EVERY player had to know EVERY part, <br/>
how&#39;s that for a challenge? WOW!). Anyhow, back from the digression, <br/>

<br/>
 My kids used to come home from school saying that they <br/>
are culturally deprived because all the other children at school <br/>
watched lots of tv and then spent most school time discussing it.  So <br/>
we pulled them from that school and now they spend their time reading <br/>
and going to Shakespeare plays instead. <br/>
<br/>
-------------snip-----------<br/>
Are you serious? I&#39;ve treated it as such, but maybe this is a joke and I didn&#39;t get it the first time. If you aren&#39;t joking,  it is not a good way to unschool, to choose to cloister your children with only the knowledge that you think is appropriate. Unschooling is about making the world more accessible, about finding and exploring more and more and sharing and feeding in lots and lots of potential sources of information. <br/>
If Simon or Linnaea came home from anything saying they wanted more, I would make that happen. I would buy a tv, if we didn&#39;t have one, I would rent videos, I would find and supply many, many things.  Whatever it was, really. I would never cut off the supply of information. In fact, given a slight competitive nature, I would research the heck out of what it was they wanted and try and be as good as their other source, maybe. <br/>

the Prairie:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are only whites in the world.<br/>
People of color are servants or objects of hate.<br/>
Punishment that includes beating with switches is normal.<br/>
Standing in corners<br/>
public humilation is normal in school<br/>
rich kids have more fun<br/>
religious kids are better behaved<br/>
the only family model that is OK is mom and dad<br/>
but step families are OK<br/>
and a personal peeve....dogs live outside<br/>
<br/>
TV is not evil.  Shakespeare is NOT highbrow and sanitized for your<br/>
protection...My tv is on all the time.  Sometimes it&#39;s kid stuff and other<br/>
times it&#39;s football...sometimes it&#39;s Everybody Loves Raymond, which has been<br/>
a very good discussion platform about how married couples should treat each<br/>
other and what my boys should look for in a wife.<br/>
<br/>
Relax...the world is a much nicer place when you do.<br/>
