&gt; OP: he pinches, punches, refuses to follow any request, command or<br/>

&gt; he&#39;ll look me straight in the eye when i make a request, demand, etc. and<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; my husband and i are completely out of solutions. i can not see what the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am wondering if I am getting this right. You are saying that your three<br/>
year old will not listen to commands and demands?<br/>
Could you give us a specific example?<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking that you perhaps you are asking him but you aren&#39;t accepting<br/>
his answers. Are you allowing him space to follow his own path? Doe he have<br/>
adequate autonomy?<br/>
<br/>
I have three dd12, ds6 and dd22months. When I want my children to do things<br/>
I ask. They are free to respond the way that fits them.<br/>
Me: &quot;dd12 could you help me bring in the groceries or watch the baby so I<br/>
can&quot;?<br/>
dd12 can answer in any way that works for her...<br/>
&quot;Sure I will watch the baby&quot;<br/>
&quot;Sure I will carry in the groceries&quot;<br/>
&quot;in a minute I am in the middle of something&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
&quot;no I don&#39;t want to&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am sure there are more options but anything is acceptable because I am<br/>
asking. I am not requesting, demanding, begging or bribing. I am asking for<br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
If the toddler wants to do something I am opposed to I try to figure out a<br/>
solution that works for both of us.<br/>
<br/>
scenario: toddler has sharpie marker and is writing on the wall.<br/>
I ask dd22m to please stop drawing on the wall. typically this is enough. If<br/>
it isn&#39;t I will offer paper and myself (to draw with her, as it seems she<br/>
also wants attention). If that doesn&#39;t work I will remind her that we have a<br/>
wall specially for drawing on and take her there.<br/>
<br/>
I do A LOT of problem solving with all my kids, even the baby. If it hasn&#39;t<br/>
been your way before it might take some getting use to. You may have to pick<br/>
your battles a little more carefully while adjusting to this new way to<br/>
communicate.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and How To Listen so Kids Will<br/>
Talk? by Faber & Mazlich? That is a really good start towards filling up<br/>
your tool box.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to write more but I am out of time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330345977">i get what you are saying and that is what i do.  i ask, and if it&#39;s &quot;please help me put away groceries&quot; he&#39;s all for it!<br/>

here&#39;s an example:<br/>
he&#39;s punching/kicking/hitting/pinching/head butting<br/>
me: auggie, that hurts, please stop. please give me nice touches.<br/>
auggie: &lt;smirks, stares me in the eye and keeps doing it&gt;<br/>
me: you are hurting my body and my feelings.  please stop<br/>
auggie:&lt;same, possibly worse&gt; it doesn&#39;t hurt you<br/>
me: yes, it does.  let&#39;s go play.<br/>
auggie: &lt;more of the same&gt;<br/>
<br/>
so i try to redirect, he escalates in the severity and frequency of his aggression.<br/>
<br/>
i then change to demanding:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;do not hurt me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
it just never stops.<br/>
<br/>
he screams and yells and we often just let it go because it makes him feel good. (never more than a suggestion like &quot;auggie, that is a loud voice, could you please use your quieter voice?&quot; we a pretty sure he sometimes doesn&#39;t even know he&#39;s doing it.)<br/>
<br/>
i understand what you are saying and he has every opportunity for autonomy.  <br/>
<br/>
he has no impulse control.  i am taking him for his well child exam next week and having him screened for sensory disorders.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ll let you know what the doc says next week. thanks for thinking about it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882345886">Chrissy, that&#39;s hard. With my ds I would hold his hands as gently as  <br/>
possible and not physically allow him to hit me. If he needed to be  <br/>
removed I would. It is absolutely not ok with me to be hit by anyone.  <br/>
I don&#39;t allow my children to hit each other in anger or without consent.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; he has no impulse control.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its not uncommon for young children to have little to no impulse control. The more proactive you can be the happier you&#39;ll be - look for ways to meet his needs *before* he&#39;s hitting you. Observe carefully what kinds of big muscle movements he enjoys and look for ways for him to use those muscle groups that don&#39;t include hurting people. If he likes punching, encourage him to punch pillows and other &quot;safe&quot; things - I don&#39;t just mean when he punches you to try to redirect him. I mean fill his day with offers and suggestions for the kind of fun he likes. Give him sticks to whack down weeds, soft things to pinch in his fingers, hold a couch cushion and encourage him to head-butt it. Brainstorm a list for yourself and hang it up somewhere you can see it. Any time he&#39;s not all wrapped up in something, offer some new, big muscle action. Some kids need a lot of big muscle stimulation - either as a phase or as an aspect of their temperament. Ray *still* needs big muscle stimulation... as I&#39;m typing he&#39;s in the workshop downstairs pounding something on his new anvil!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*Does* it hurt you? If he&#39;s actively hurting you, then saying &quot;stop&quot; in a nice voice isn&#39;t helpful. You&#39;re giving him conflicting messages. If you&#39;re hurt say &quot;hey, that hurts&quot; in a loud, firm tone right off the bat. Learn to block punches safely if you need to, until you can figure out the proactive part of dealing with his needs, but don&#39;t let him hurt you. That&#39;s not good for either of you.<br/>
<br/>
Kids, even adults can smirk or smile under stress. I have a strong impulse to laugh under stress that I&#39;ve learned to control bc its just soooooooo socially inappropriate. I once read that smiling has evolved from an expression some mammals use to show submissiveness - which may or may not be true, but I find it interesting in this context. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so i try to redirect, he escalates in the severity and frequency of his aggression.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i then change to demanding<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of the problem may be that you&#39;re using an approach that&#39;s too verbal. Shorten the whole interaction down to: &quot;stop, do this instead&quot; and then *give* him something else to hit, right then and there. Or wrap him up in a big playful hug and wrestle him so he gets the big, physical stimulation he needs in a different way.<br/>
<br/>
But the important part is the proactive part. If he has poor impulse control, then by the time he&#39;s hitting he has none at all - so redirecting is going to be hard, at best. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; having him screened for sensory disorders<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whether or not he has a sensory delay/disorder, being proactive is the most important thing you can do for him. And either way, I totally recommend you read &quot;The Out of Sync Child&quot; for its wonderful lists of activities. <br/>
