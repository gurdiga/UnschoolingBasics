<div id="ygrps-yiv-54093614">Hello, <br/>
I used to think my child might suffer from ADHD.  People, especially <br/>
neighbors who saw him often, gave him the evil eye.  Some of the <br/>
children came right out and told him their parents didn&#39;t like him.  <br/>
I can&#39;t imagine how painful that was for a 5 yr old to here.  I knew <br/>
that getting in trouble all the time was beginning to seriously chip <br/>
away at his self-esteem.  I myself was starting to wonder though if <br/>
something was really wrong with him.  <br/>
So began my quest for info regarding ADHD and what was known and <br/>
unknown.  <br/>
A book called the Family Virtues Guide enlightened me.  The author <br/>
explained that children that appear to be, for instance bossy, are <br/>
natural leaders who need to learn the virtues of patience and <br/>
compassion.  I began to wonder if my child had been mislabeled.  I <br/>
discovered that he was not annoying; he was active, energetic & <br/>
brilliant. He was behaving normally for him- even thought he didn&#39;t <br/>
fit societies version of normal.  <br/>
I also encourage you to see Raising Cane if you haven&#39;t.  I have not <br/>
seen it yet but have heard that it has helped many parents realize <br/>
that there is absolutely nothing wrong with their children. Maybe <br/>
Grandma might be persuaded to watch it too.  <br/>
I discovered that in my case, my child&#39;s ADHD related aggression, <br/>
impatience & impulsiveness were learned behaviors and that I need to <br/>
learn how to model patience, compassion & non-violent communication. <br/>
<br/>
As far as the soda goes, I encourage you to hold off on that if <br/>
possible.  It might be much more beneficial if he could learn how to <br/>
help himself in a natural way.  I think that once we attach to the <br/>
thought that something outside ourselves is the answer to our <br/>
challenges we begin the never-ending quest for that magic thing to <br/>
help solve our &quot;problems&quot;.  <br/>
I suggest experimenting with guided imagery (very calming), peaceful <br/>
music, breath control and other mind control techniques. I would <br/>
make a game out of it and see what you both can come up with it- <br/>
sort of a challenge not a problem.  I believe he will feel much <br/>
better, self-esteem wise if he learns that he is brilliant and that <br/>
only he can truly help himself.  <br/>
Peace & Blessings, <br/>
Sandra</div>
