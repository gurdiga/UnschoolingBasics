<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050606703">&quot;. I really want to find a place where we fit in a<br/>
little, where my son can make a friend.Perhaps I&#39;m trying too hard.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re in the wrong place I think. <br/>
I can tell you from experience, that the differences will just get<br/>
deeper and you&#39;ll feel more and more out of place. I&#39;m not sure why<br/>
that would be a great place to find acceptance for an unschooled child<br/>
that has difficulty in social situations. <br/>
<br/>
Does he really feel a need for more social activities? Are you feeling<br/>
that it&#39;s something good for him or is he asking for more? I would<br/>
really look for alternative mommies that schooled, before I looked at<br/>
groups of Christian homeschoolers. BTDT...no thanks.<br/>
