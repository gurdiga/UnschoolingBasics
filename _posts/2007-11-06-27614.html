<br/>
	ARGH is a two-day event loosely inspired by BarCamp, an experiment in<br/>
bringing people together to share, learn and play in an open<br/>
environment.  For more information on Barcamps, check this website: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://barcamp.org/">http://barcamp.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
How the Schedule Works<br/>
ARGH has no strict format. The actual schedule will be determined as a<br/>
group on Saturday morning based on the number of, and interest in, the<br/>
proposed sessions. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	Event details<br/>
<br/>
When:  Friday November 23rd and Saturday November 24th.<br/>
Where:  Locations to be announced soon! <br/>
Cost:  Requested donation of $10 per family to cover space rental<br/>
costs and help cover some of Steve and Eli&#39;s travel costs.  If your<br/>
family can help out with a bit more, that is great. If you truly can&#39;t<br/>
afford it, please come anyway!! All are welcome regardless of<br/>
financial situations. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Schedule:<br/>
<br/>
Friday<br/>
<br/>
~Potluck and drum circle 5pm-8pm<br/>
<br/>
~For anyone wanting to stay up later and hear some live music,<br/>
Cristabel and the Jons will be playing in downtown Johnson City at<br/>
Acoustic Coffeehouse at 10pm. You can hear some of their music at<br/>
myspace:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/christabelmusic">http://www.myspace.com/christabelmusic</a><br/>
<br/>
Acoustic Coffeehouse has food (including some veggie choices), great<br/>
beer, smoothies and more for those that want to hang out for a while.<br/>
It&#39;s a diverse and family friendly environment. Cristabel plays a lot<br/>
of old standards and swing style music, great fun for dancing!<br/>
<br/>
Saturday <br/>
<br/>
This will be loosely structured in the bar camp style. We will post<br/>
all possible topics and everyone will decide which they&#39;d like to<br/>
attend. We&#39;ll split up into various areas with a very open format that<br/>
gives everyone input and allows for a lot of flow. The main idea is to<br/>
have fun, learn and share while building connections with other<br/>
unschoolers (and those interested in unschooling) in our region.<br/>
<br/>
Proposed Sessions <br/>
	&quot;Winging It Around the World: Assorted Nuts and Bolts of World<br/>
Travel&quot; (Eli)<br/>
	&quot;Self-Educated = Self-Employed: Entrepreneurism 101&quot; (Steve/Eli)<br/>
	Grown Unschooler Panel (if you have a teen/young adult unschooler<br/>
that might like to participate, please let me       <br/>
        know!)<br/>
	&quot;The case for creativity&quot; (Ren)<br/>
         &quot;The Zen of Unschooling&quot; (Ren)<br/>
	&quot;Creating Community: A Structured Conversation&quot; (Steve)<br/>
	Ongoing ATC funshop<br/>
        Cob building and sustainable communities workshop (Katherine)<br/>
<br/>
Please add your ideas here. Any passion or interest you&#39;d like to<br/>
share with others, is most welcome as a possible topic.  Think of<br/>
topics you might like to see discussed also.  There just might be<br/>
someone willing to facilitate such a discussion!:)<br/>
<br/>
	Planners<br/>
	Ren Allen, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:starsuncloud@...">starsuncloud@...</a> <br/>
	Eli Gerzon, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:egwizard@...">egwizard@...</a> <br/>
	Steve Cooperman, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:stevecooperman@...">stevecooperman@...</a><br/>
	<br/>
<br/>
Please email me to be added to the participants list.<br/>
Walk-ups are also welcome, but we need some idea of how many to expect<br/>
in order to better plan. Thank you!!<br/>
<br/>
	Task List/items to bring:<br/>
<br/>
~Anyone willing to bring a couple items to share for the toddler<br/>
corner (open to any and all ages, the idea is to have items that are<br/>
safe for little ones for ongoing play) let me know.<br/>
I will have large legos and brio train track in abundance. Bring<br/>
anything other than those items. Once a person offers to bring an<br/>
item(s) we won&#39;t have anyone else bring that so it&#39;s easier to sort<br/>
out when the day is over.<br/>
<br/>
~Any art supplies you might enjoy using for ATC&#39;s.  More information<br/>
can be found about artist trading cards here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cedarseed.com/air/atc.html">http://www.cedarseed.com/air/atc.html</a><br/>
I will have plenty of blank ATC&#39;s for you and your family to create<br/>
with.  Bring some extra scissors (might want to mark with your name)<br/>
glue sticks, stickers, funky papers, embellishments, stamps etc...<br/>
anything you would enjoy using. There will be art materials available<br/>
for everyone to use also.<br/>
<br/>
~Sack Lunch for Saturday lunch break.  Once a location is secured, I<br/>
will post a list of nearby restaurants and delivery for those that<br/>
prefer this option. I am hoping to have a location that will have a<br/>
kitchen available for us.<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
**Note: If you&#39;re traveling from out of town and plan to stay<br/>
overnight, please let me know right away so I can secure a discount<br/>
for everyone. Sleep Inn has promised a $62.99 price if I book a<br/>
certain number of rooms for our group. Their usual rate is $84.99. <br/>
They are located near the freeway, lots of restaurants, Barnes and<br/>
Noble etc.... If you need other options please let me know that also.<br/>
It would be nice to have a single hotel so folks can connect with each<br/>
other more easily when coming from other areas.<br/>
<br/>
Also: If anyone wants to stay around for Sunday to just hang out and<br/>
walk downtown Jonesborough (or go to a park, or???) that is an option<br/>
too!  My family will certainly be available for more fun.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793618633">For anyone that is coming into the Tri-cities area for the ARGH<br/>
gathering on November 23rd ad 24th, I have the hotel information for you.<br/>
Sleep Inn has agreed to give our group a generous discount. Regular<br/>
rate is $84.99, but for our group it will be $62.00 per night. I have<br/>
reserved a block of rooms for both Friday and Saturday night if anyone<br/>
wants to stay and hang out on Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
Please call them to book as soon as possible if you&#39;re coming<br/>
overnight!  Until you reserve your own room, there is nothing saved<br/>
for you. They will release that block back to the public if they are<br/>
not booked soon.<br/>
<br/>
Please call Sleep Inn directly to book your room:  423-915-0081<br/>
They are located at 2020 Franklin Terrace in Johnson City, right off<br/>
of I-26. <br/>
You can look at the location at google maps here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tiny.cc/K0ySY">http://www.tiny.cc/K0ySY</a>  <br/>
<br/>
Make sure you tell them you are with the ARGH homeschool group so they<br/>
will give you the discount!! Very important.<br/>
You can reserve your room anytime now, starting tonight.<br/>
<br/>
I will be sure to email everyone very clear directions to both the<br/>
potluck and Sat. activity locations before you get here.:)  See you soon!<br/>

	ARGH is a two-day event loosely inspired by BarCamp, an experiment in<br/>

How the Schedule Works<br/>
<br/>
ARGH has no strict format. The actual schedule will be determined as a<br/>
group on Saturday morning based on the number of, and interest in, the<br/>
proposed sessions. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	Event details<br/>
<br/>
When:  Friday November 23rd and Saturday November 24th.<br/>
Where:  Johnson City TN area<br/>
Cost:  Requested donation of $10 per family to cover space rental<br/>
costs and help cover some of Steve and Eli&#39;s travel costs.  If your<br/>
family can help out with a bit more, that is great. If you truly can&#39;t<br/>
afford it, please come anyway!! All are welcome regardless of<br/>
financial situations. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Schedule:<br/>
<br/>
Friday<br/>
<br/>
~Potluck and drum circle 5pm-8pm at Kiwanis Rec Center on Market<br/>
Street. Bring a dish to share and drinks for your family.  If you have<br/>
drums, please bring them along!<br/>
<br/>
~For anyone wanting to stay up later and hear some live music,<br/>
Cristabel and the Jons will be playing in downtown Johnson City at<br/>
Acoustic Coffeehouse at 10pm. You can hear some of their music at<br/>
myspace:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/christabelmusic">http://www.myspace.com/christabelmusic</a><br/>
<br/>
Acoustic Coffeehouse has food (including some veggie choices), great<br/>
beer, smoothies and more for those that want to hang out for a while.<br/>
It&#39;s a diverse and family friendly environment. Cristabel plays a lot<br/>
of old standards and swing style music, great fun for dancing!  They<br/>
do request that minors leave at 11pm (city thing) so we could just<br/>
hang out on the non-stage side after the potluck rather than waiting<br/>
to get down there until 10pm.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday <br/>
<br/>
10am-6pm at Trinity Baptist Church on Hwy. 11E in Jonesborough.<br/>
This church is letting us use a main room and a couple classrooms plus<br/>
a kitchen. The kitchen has everything needed to prepare/heat your lunch.<br/>
<br/>
This will be loosely structured in the bar camp style. We will post<br/>
all possible topics and everyone will decide which they&#39;d like to<br/>
attend. We&#39;ll split up into various areas with a very open format that<br/>
gives everyone input and allows for a <br/>
lot of flow. The main idea is to have fun, learn and share while<br/>
building connections with other unschoolers (and those interested in<br/>
unschooling) in our <br/>
region.<br/>
<br/>
Proposed Sessions <br/>

Please email me to be added to the participants list.<br/>
Walk-ups are also welcome, but we need some idea of how many to expect<br/>
in order to better plan. Thank you!!<br/>
<br/>
	Task List/requested items to bring:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~Anyone willing to bring a couple items to share for the toddler<br/>
corner (open to any and all ages, the idea is to have items that are<br/>
safe for little ones for ongoing play) let me know.<br/>
I will have large legos and brio train track in abundance. Bring<br/>
anything other than those items. Once a person offers to bring an<br/>
item(s) we won&#39;t have anyone else bring that so it&#39;s easier to sort<br/>
out when the day is over.<br/>
<br/>
~Any art supplies you might enjoy using for ATC&#39;s.  More information<br/>
can be found about artist trading cards here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cedarseed.com/air/atc.html">http://www.cedarseed.com/air/atc.html</a><br/>
I will have plenty of blank ATC&#39;s for you and your family to create<br/>
with.  Bring some extra scissors (might want to mark with your name)<br/>
glue sticks, stickers, funky papers, embellishments, stamps etc...<br/>
anything you would enjoy using. <br/>
There will be art materials available for everyone to use also.<br/>
<br/>
~Taco Bell, McDonalds, Arby&#39;s, Jonesborough Pizza Parlour and other<br/>
restaurants are nearby if needed.  The location is also within short<br/>
driving distance to several grocery stores.<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
Overnight accommodations can be found at Sleep Inn. If our group<br/>
reserves at least fiverooms, the rate will be $62.00 instead of the<br/>
usual $84.99.  You can contact Sleep Inn at 423-915-0081.  I will be<br/>
emailing directions to both activity locations from the Sleep Inn<br/>
and from the freeway.  The hotel is conveniently located near I-26,<br/>
Barnes and Noble, Atlanta Bread Co., Natural Food Market and other<br/>
businesses.  It&#39;s an easy drive to both activity locations for Friday<br/>
and Saturday.  **NOTE:  Please make sure you tell them you are with<br/>
the ARGH homeschool group so they apply your discount!!<br/>

Jackson lived in for a year or so while he practiced law in<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333902355">Unschooling gathering in Eastern TN!!<br/>
<br/>
There is still time to make your reservations and join us here in<br/>
Eastern TN for a gathering of unschoolers, enjoying a fun weekend<br/>
together!  I really hope more of you will consider joining us:<br/>
<br/>
Autodidact Radical Gathering of Homeschoolers<br/>
<br/>
ARGH is a two-day event loosely inspired by BarCamp, an experiment in<br/>
bringing people together to share, learn and play in an open<br/>
environment. For more information on Barcamps, check this website:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://barcamp.org/">http://barcamp.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
How the Schedule Works<br/>
<br/>
ARGH has no strict format. The actual schedule will be determined as a<br/>
group on Saturday morning based on the number of, and interest in, the<br/>
proposed sessions. Feel free to offer something, or request!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Event details<br/>
<br/>
When: Friday November 23rd and Saturday November 24th.<br/>
Where: Johnson City TN<br/>
Cost: Requested donation of $10 per family to cover space rental costs<br/>
and help cover some of Steve and Eli&#39;s travel costs. If your family<br/>
can help out with a bit more, that is great. If you truly can&#39;t afford<br/>
it, please come anyway!! All are welcome regardless of financial<br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Schedule:<br/>
<br/>
Friday<br/>
<br/>
~Potluck and drum circle 5pm-8pm at Kiwanis Rec Center on Market<br/>
Street. Bring a dish to share and drinks for your family. If you have<br/>
drums, please bring them along!<br/>
<br/>
~For anyone wanting to stay up later and hear some live music,<br/>
Cristabel and the Jons will be playing in downtown Johnson City at<br/>
Acoustic Coffeehouse at 10pm. You can hear some of their music at<br/>
myspace: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/christabelmusic">http://www.myspace.com/christabelmusic</a><br/>
<br/>
Acoustic Coffeehouse has food (including some veggie choices), great<br/>
beer, smoothies and more for those that want to hang out for a while.<br/>
It&#39;s a diverse and family friendly environment. Cristabel plays a lot<br/>
of old standards and swing style music, great fun for dancing! They do<br/>
request that minors leave at 11pm (city thing) so we could just hang<br/>
out on the non-stage side after the potluck rather than waiting to get<br/>
down there until 10pm.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday<br/>
<br/>
10am-6pm at Trinity Baptist Church on Hwy. 11E in Jonesborough.<br/>
This church is letting us use a main room and a couple classrooms plus<br/>
a kitchen. The kitchen has everything needed to prepare/heat your lunch.<br/>
<br/>
This will be loosely structured in the bar camp style. We will post<br/>
all possible topics and everyone will decide which they&#39;d like to<br/>
attend. We&#39;ll split up into various areas with a very open format that<br/>
gives everyone input and allows for a<br/>
lot of flow. The main idea is to have fun, learn and share while<br/>
building connections with other unschoolers (and those interested in<br/>
unschooling) in our<br/>
region.<br/>
<br/>
Proposed Sessions<br/>
<br/>
~&quot;Winging It Around the World: Assorted Nuts and Bolts of World Travel&quot;<br/>
(Eli)<br/>
<br/>
~&quot;Self-Educated = Self-Employed: Entrepreneurism 101&quot; (Steve/Eli)<br/>
<br/>
~Grown Unschooler Panel (if you have a teen/young adult unschooler<br/>
thatmight like to participate, please let me know!)<br/>
<br/>
~&quot;The case for creativity&quot; (Ren)<br/>
<br/>
~&quot;The Zen of Unschooling&quot; (Ren)<br/>
<br/>
~&quot;Creating Community: A Structured Conversation&quot; (Steve)<br/>
<br/>
~Ongoing ATC funshop<br/>
<br/>
~Cob building and sustainable communities workshop (Katherine)<br/>
<br/>
Please add your ideas here. Any passion or interest you&#39;d like to<br/>
share with others, is most welcome as a possible topic. Think of<br/>
topics you might like to see discussed also. There just might be<br/>
someone willing to facilitate such a discussion!:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573825511">For anyone on the fence about going...<br/>
Last year I drove from SD to OR to visit my friends, the Gold Family. Once<br/>
my trip was confirmed, it was &quot;well, why not see who else will come?&quot; on<br/>
Mary&#39;s part. We had an amazing Non-Con (Not a Conference) adventure! This<br/>
year, the 2nd annual NonCon coincided with my housewarming! Check out my<br/>
blog for pictures and links to other blogs with pictures. It&#39;s an amazing<br/>
and powerful thing to gather with unschoolers.<br/>
Go! It&#39;s worth every mile!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573639416">If anyone is still thinking about joining us for the Unschooling<br/>
gathering this weekend (Fri/Sat) in Johnson City TN, there is still<br/>
time and we&#39;d love to have you come!!<br/>
<br/>
Just in case there is any confusion, we are styling the structure of<br/>
this like a Barcamp but it is NOT technology focused, it&#39;s<br/>
play/unschooling focused.:)  We are simply using the idea of an open<br/>
forum with less structure for this gathering. The format allows for a<br/>
lot of creative flow!<br/>
<br/>
There will be games and crafts and bag ice cream and round table<br/>
discussions and lotsa time to just chat too.  Come on out for a great<br/>
time and the chance to meet with other unschooling (or unschooling<br/>
interested) families.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For everyone that is planning to attend the ARGH unschooling<br/>
gathering, here are the details about where to meet: <br/>
<br/>
For the Friday night potluck, we are at the Kiwanis Rec. Center on<br/>
Market Street. From the Sleep Inn in Johnson City (near I-26), you<br/>
will just go back out to State of Franklin, head south and you will<br/>
come to the intersection of Market street (11E) where the rec center<br/>
is on.  Take a left onto Market and it&#39;s just a little ways up on your<br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
When heading out for Saturday&#39;s activities, turn right onto 11E/Market<br/>
street from State of Franklin and head West towards Jonesborough. You<br/>
will pass the new Wal-Mart and go about 3 miles (roughly). You&#39;ll see<br/>
the sign for Trinity Baptist on your right, but you&#39;ll go past it to<br/>
the next intersection which is Headtown Road. Take a right on Headtown<br/>
and go a short distance to the church driveway. It will be marked with<br/>
another Trinity Baptist sign on your right. As you face the church,<br/>
you can enter by the main doors, or there is a set of doors to your<br/>
right which is near the rooms we will be using all day.<br/>
<br/>
See you there!!:)<br/>
