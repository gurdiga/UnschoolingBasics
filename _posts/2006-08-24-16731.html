<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404194315">I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on dealing with depression<br/>
in an adolescent.  My just 13yo dd had a wonderful exciting summer. <br/>
She was ecstatic about being in a local theatre production. She was up<br/>
at 7:00 without fuss to get to rehersals every morning for five weeks,<br/>
declaring that she found her &quot;thing&quot; (acting).  She was on cloud nine.  <br/>
<br/>
I was kind of anticipating a big let down when the show was over, and<br/>
sure enough, she&#39;s now in a real funk.  Thankfully she talks about<br/>
what she&#39;s feeling: sad, like she&#39;s a zombie, days are pointless,<br/>
nothing to look forward to, dread, etc. She&#39;s also feeling anxiety<br/>
because she&#39;s feeling so bad. She looks to me for answers and trusts<br/>
me to help her and it&#39;s so important for me to make sure I&#39;m doing the<br/>
best I can.  I&#39;ve assured her that being depressed is part of life and<br/>
it will pass. I know boredom causes her dread, so we&#39;ve been trying to<br/>
plan and keep busy.  I&#39;ve been with her 24/7 sleeping on an air<br/>
mattress in her room because she&#39;s been feeling anxious.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
staying upbeat and not showing her my concern, but I am concerned.   <br/>
<br/>
  She does have things to look forward to, she&#39;s starting an acting<br/>
class with the same people that put on the summer production, we&#39;re<br/>
throwing a &quot;cast reunion&quot; party next month,and we&#39;re planning a trip<br/>
inNovember along with other small plans over the comingweeks. She&#39;s<br/>
trying hard to fight it, but she&#39;s struggling. I&#39;m pretty sure once<br/>
things get going in mid-September she&#39;ll start coming out of it, but<br/>
she/we need some tools in the meantime. <br/>

Have any of you dealt with this?  What has worked?  Any ideas for her<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344478695">My only suggestion for you is to try to show that the times between busy, fun activities are good rest time. We all need our rest periods. Maybe if she thinks of it as rest in preparation for the fun times she&#39;ll feel better. Remind her it is just a temporary lull and things will pick back up again soon. Last year when we moved to Oregon and I expereinced the Eugene &quot;rainy season&quot; for the first time it was a bit hard on me. I am actually looking forward to that winter rest this year. Spring, summer and fall are so busy for us that I long for those days when we stay in and read, watch movies, sew or just sleep! <br/>

Take Care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-71875020">You are e a very good mom to take your daughter&#39;s depression and <br/>
anxiety seriously and even sleeping in her room.  I started <br/>
experiencing depression and anxiety a year ago when we moved and  <br/>
got into a huge remodeling project.  I was (and still am) trying to <br/>
help my son with autism with special diets and such as well.  <br/>
Anyway, it just hit me like a train and I had feelings I had never <br/>
felt before.  I felt sweaty, scared, anxious and had huge adrenaline <br/>
surges.  I would be soaking wet when I woke up from anxiety.  Later, <br/>
I actually went on Paxil to try to get some help after talking to a <br/>
psychiatrist.  It was the best thing I did to go see a <br/>
professional.  The Paxil made all the anxiety and depression go away <br/>
and I was on a very low dose.  I am not necessarily advocating Paxil <br/>
(and I don&#39;t do meds with my son), but I reluctantly tried it at <br/>
that time.  After 3 weeks of being on it, I felt like my old self <br/>
and decided to go off of it, and I was so happy to realize that I <br/>
didn&#39;t need it...but I know it&#39;s there if I ever feel that bad <br/>
again.  <br/>
<br/>
There are some wonderful books out there as well that list many <br/>
techniques for dealing with anxiety and depression.  I love &quot;Coping <br/>
with Anxiety:  10 simple ways to relieve anxiety, fear and worry&quot;.  <br/>
It is a PB that isn&#39;t too long and wordy (found in local bookstore <br/>
less than a year ago).  The biggest thing that will help right now <br/>
is major exercise.  It really makes a huge difference!  The book <br/>
also discusses diet and how important eating right is right now.  <br/>
There are also many herbs such as St. John&#39;s Wort (I started <br/>
drinking Kava tea at bedtime) that the book discusses.  <br/>
<br/>
I think you are very wise to take her feeling this bad seriously.  <br/>
It is very scary to feel miserable and in fight/flight mode all the <br/>
time.  You feel like you will never enjoy life or be happy again.  <br/>
And the nights were the worst!  I was also subscribed sleeping <br/>
pills, which I used several times.  They worked effectively and so I <br/>
wasn&#39;t so worried about the night and able to face it without <br/>
dread.  I would also consider taking her to a doctor to check out <br/>
hormone levels and such.  My dr. put me on progesterone cream, which <br/>
helps with cortisol and adrenaline levels.  There is a ton of info <br/>
if you check out &quot;anxiety and worry&quot; online.  <br/>
<br/>
In a way, I am glad I went through this, because I have learned many <br/>
techniques to help me deal with scary and depressing situations.  I <br/>
feel stronger with many tools available to cope with whatever the <br/>
future holds.  I hope I helped in some way.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106771547">Another book that I would really recommend for any and every woman to read is &quot;Women&#39;s Moods: What every woman must know about hormones, the brain, and emotional health&quot; by Deborah Sichel and Jeanne Watson Driscoll. It&#39;s very easy to read, and incredibly informative and helpful. It talks about medications, but also about other ways to help your brain be healthy without meds. I would recommend it to any female dealing with mental illness or who wants to be aware of the warning signs for mental illness.<br/>
