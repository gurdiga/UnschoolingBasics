<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524259279">Hello I have read a many post recently and a lot of you have began <br/>
the quest to LIVE and quit your current lifework... I am curious on <br/>
how you began the planning stages of that.. <br/>
Did you or do you have a mortgage?<br/>
Did you sell?<br/>
What about the bills.. how did you manage that .. (if you have lots)<br/>
<br/>
My husband is in a job that is better for sure than the last but he <br/>
is not happy to the fullest. We are struggling paycheck to paycheck <br/>
and he hates it.. He sees nothing for his hard work except more <br/>
work. I want to travel the states for a while and he wants to quit <br/>
and begin writting a book. We are very afraid of doing it though.. <br/>
We have a 1st and a 2nd on the house.. YEP BIG MISTAKE THERE!!!<br/>
 He has had this dream for 10yrs now..To write a book and I want to <br/>
see him do it..   <br/>
But we are a 1 income family with to much debt.. <br/>
Any suggestions on how to begin a plan for a &quot;work free&quot; life would <br/>
be great. We are located North of Seattle, Wa. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765118919">I highly, highly recommend the book &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot; by Joe<br/>
Dominguez and Vicki Robin. That book, while I haven&#39;t fully<br/>
implemented everything in it, helped change my relationship to work<br/>
and money - or contributed to my ongoing relationships with those. It<br/>
was life-changing - over the long run for me, very quickly for some<br/>
other folks.<br/>
<br/>
You can find it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/3buyr5">http://tinyurl.com/3buyr5</a><br/>
<br/>
Before I ever read that book, I asked myself, &quot;If I had unlimited<br/>
money, time and energy, what would I do with my time?&quot; Then set about<br/>
finding ways to make that happen - because there&#39;s always a way! I&#39;ve<br/>
had quite a journey with that question, and sometimes I&#39;m not even &quot;on<br/>
that path&quot; because I&#39;ve gotten caught up in the drama of life, but I<br/>
always return to it. I have grown so much through that whole process;<br/>
it&#39;s been a very powerful adjunct to unschooling. Both have really<br/>
worked and reworked my whole belief system, and helped heal some<br/>
things from my past.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings to you on your journey! Keep following your heart ~<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-159870165">Hi Kasey,<br/>
There&#39;s a whole slew of families out there, traveling full time, who have<br/>
left any sort of &quot;expected ways to live&quot; behind (house, mortgage, cars,<br/>
stuff, stuff, stuff...) sold it all, bought a motor home/camper/big<br/>
tent/bus, etc.  and hit the road to live outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple lists if you&#39;d like to listen in a while, ask questions,<br/>
or just hear how life works out for them.  One of them is specifically for<br/>
Unschoolers living on the road full time.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck, and never stop dreaming! :)<br/>
