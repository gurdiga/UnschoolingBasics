<div id="ygrps-yiv-119887819">Good Morning Everyone, Well we are new to this whole unschooling thing. <br/>
I have been doing research on it for a while now but after a horrible<br/>
experience in public school my husband and I decided that homeschooling<br/>
would be the best for our ds (who will be 6 next week).  I guess I<br/>
should tell you a little about us.  We are a Navy family currently in<br/>
FL.  I&#39;ve been married for over 8 years now and we have 2 wonderful<br/>
children......Morgan Kay who is 3 and Christopher who is almost 6.  Both<br/>
sides of our family are, to say the least, not happy with our decision<br/>
to homeschool and when I brought up unschooling even my dear husband was<br/>
a little skeptical.  So in a compromise we are using a few worksheets<br/>
here and there but for the most part you could say we unschool.  Ds<br/>
loves it and I have seen SUCH a difference in dd.  So my questions are<br/>
these.......did any of you run across opposition when you told your<br/>
family you were going to unschool?  how did your spouse/partner feel<br/>
about this decision?  now we are attempting to change our parenting<br/>
style and so far it is working but it is really hard for me to change my<br/>
views on discipline and my reactions to &quot;misbehavior&#39;s&quot; from the kids. <br/>
i&#39;ve been reading the book positive discipline, anyone familiar with it?<br/>
i must admit after using just a few of the techniques from the book my<br/>
house is so much more calmer!!!  i would be thankful for any suggested<br/>
reading or advice from those of you who changed their parenting style. <br/>
Well it is snack time and then off to run errands...............thank<br/>
you all in advance for your answers and advice. Christian<br/>

<br/>
Welcome Christian. :-) <br/>
<br/>
I never told anyone. I just started making changes in my home and in <br/>
myself. In the mainstream unschooling is controversial, so when I <br/>
was learning about it, I felt better keeping my thoughts to myself <br/>
until I felt more confident. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;how did your spouse/partner feel about this decision? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband Billy, trusts my judgement on important issues. Also, we <br/>
had had several conversations about it, while our kids were still in <br/>
school. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;i would be thankful for any suggested reading or advice from <br/>

Read some of the archives from this list. Also, check the links <br/>
section. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285618060">Hello.  I never post here but I&#39;ve been a member for a long time and <br/>
lurk now and then. I just wanted to respond to this one.<br/>
<br/>
We started unschooling a year ago.  I have a 7 yo, 5 yo and 2 yo <br/>
twins.  We had mixed support from our families about homeschooling. <br/>
I didn&#39;t tell them anything about unschooling.  As the year went by, <br/>
they found out one way or another that we are unschooling.  Everyone <br/>
is baffled by it.<br/>
<br/>
I started peaceful (nonmanipulative) parenting before my dh did.  <br/>
For a while there we had such different approaches to parenting that <br/>
our kids were confused and everyone was pretty miserable.  One book <br/>
that helped was Parent Effectiveness Training by Thomas Gordon.  He <br/>
explained the effects of manipulating and controlling kids in a way <br/>
that made sense to my dh.  Since then we have gone deeper into <br/>
mindful parenting.  But that was a good beginning.<br/>
<br/>
As far as relatives go, I have been tempted to &quot;convince&quot; them or <br/>
win them over.  But I had to question my motives.  Yes it would be <br/>
nice to have everybody treat my children with dignity and trust.  <br/>
But that is not where they are.  Nobody has asked for my advice.  No <br/>
one wants it necessarily. (I learned I can clear a room real quick <br/>
just talking about treating children with more respect!)  I don&#39;t <br/>
allow anyone to yell at my children or grab them in a disrespectful <br/>
way. And frankly, I get all stressed out when I try to control <br/>
everybody else.  I trust my children.<br/>
<br/>
Forums like this one are great places to connect.  It&#39;s nice to know <br/>
there are other families like ours peppered across the country.  An <br/>
unschooling convention is another great way to meet other families <br/>
and get support.  We went to Rethinking Education in Dallas last <br/>
year because it was the closest to us.  That was a real turning <br/>
point for me.  I think unschooling needs peaceful parenting in order <br/>
to work.  And peaceful parenting needs both parents to be on board <br/>
(especially if they are in the same house).  But don&#39;t give up on <br/>
your dh.  Perhaps if he hears it from a source that makes sense to <br/>
him, he can own it.  Then he won&#39;t be doing it just to please you.  <br/>
My dh and I have come a long way but we&#39;re still working on it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Ds<br/>
&gt; loves it and I have seen SUCH a difference in dd.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the key.  Watching my kids, I know we have made the right <br/>
choice.  Good luck.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll be speaking at that conference this fall!!:) I&#39;m really looking<br/>
forward to visiting TX again and meeting some unschoolers down that way.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another really fabulous conference up here in the beautiful<br/>
Appalachian mountains called Live and Learn<br/>
(liveandlearnconference.org) if you want a change of pace this time<br/>
around. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448098874">Ren, i saw that! We live three hours from Dallas, and when I read that online, I turned to my <br/>
husband and said &quot;REN ALLEN IS GOING TO BE IN DALLAS!!!&quot; Funny is that he knew exactly <br/>
who I was talking about and asked if we wanted to go. Kinda, but we&#39;re planning on leaving <br/>
early for the L&L so we can stay with my cousin in TN for a few days before.<br/>
<br/>
Going to a conference really does make all the difference in the world. Okay, maybe living <br/>
your life and seeing it work makes ALL the difference, but conferences really help when you <br/>
start out. We went to our first one last year and dh finally climbed on board. he needs a <br/>
booster shot though, so I am so glad we&#39;ll come this year!<br/>
