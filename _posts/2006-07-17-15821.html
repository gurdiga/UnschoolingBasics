<div id="ygrps-yiv-667795273">Apparently, I am missing something. so I am going to ask very basic <br/>
honest questions about unschooling in hopes that I can at least get <br/>
clarity. This is not to insult anyone, I am really asking.<br/>
<br/>
Am I right or are approximate bed times taboo in unschooling circles?<br/>
<br/>
What about insisting on respect from children (express yourself but <br/>
watch your tone kind of thing)? Is this also taboo?<br/>
<br/>
The impression I get is that unschooling (please forgive my <br/>
ignorance I thought the unschooling ideals were limited to not <br/>
forcing the child to &quot;do school&quot; and letting them direct the <br/>
learning that WOULD be engaged in) parents engourage their kids to <br/>
have fun and experience life but don&#39;t require anything of the <br/>
children that they don&#39;t want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Am I right about that? Am I asking this correctly?<br/>
<br/>
If not, can someone please explain what &quot;Unschooling&quot; practically <br/>
and the philosophy behind teaching a child to navigate life.<br/>
<br/>
I stay at home with my kids all day. None are in school and none are <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time.</div>

<br/>
What about insisting on respect from children (express yourself but<br/>

<br/>
There are no &quot;taboo&#39;s&quot;, but you might get questioned or given options<br/>
on this list that are different. That&#39;s all.:)<br/>
<br/>
When a parent says &quot;I trust you to learn what you want when you want&quot;<br/>
but then insists on lights out at 9pm every night, that isn&#39;t trusting<br/>
the child to learn about their body&#39;s need for sleep.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t paying attention to their body signs of<br/>
tiredness, or helping them transition to sleep. It means a time is<br/>
less important than helping them to sleep when they&#39;re actually tired.<br/>
That&#39;s all. For some kids it will happen at roughly the same time<br/>
every night (unless they go through a growth spurt or other change)<br/>
for others it varies. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how anyone can &quot;insist on respect&quot; since respect would be<br/>
something another person feels. We can&#39;t control how another person<br/>
feels, but we CAN manipulate them enough to get fake respect.<br/>
I think it&#39;s better to act in a way that earns respect. If we treat<br/>
our children respectfully, they&#39;ll be more likely to give respect.<br/>
<br/>
Most children are treated so disrespectfully, and then the parents<br/>
demand this &quot;respect&quot; they haven&#39;t earned. It&#39;s sad.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, do I ask my child to treat me kindly? Sure.<br/>
Jalen (5) is a very intense child to say the least. He tends to act<br/>
out his emotions without pause...which leads to screaming or angry<br/>
words. When we have a moment to pause and talk, he really doesn&#39;t WANT<br/>
to be that way. In fact, after a particularly rough day today, he said<br/>
&quot;I wish I didn&#39;t feel crazy inside&quot;.<br/>
He FEELS that out-of-control feeling and doesn&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing I can do for him, is to gently (which I sometimes fail<br/>
miserably at) remind him that I don&#39;t like being screamed at. When he<br/>
yells &quot;get me my goggles&quot;, I DO say something along the lines of &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t like being screamed at, all you have to do is talk to me!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I remind him daily that talking is a great way to get help. Slowly, he<br/>
is becoming more capable of calmiing himself faster. I have no control<br/>
over how he feels, but I can act in a respectful manner myself, and<br/>
that makes it likely he will  learn those skills in his own time and<br/>
way. The rest of my children are very kind and sweet and yes,<br/>
respectful. It&#39;s all part of their learning...just like everything<br/>
else in life.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All people have a bedtime (except those of us that tend to deal with<br/>
insomnia from time to time :) )  The key is learning when your body is<br/>
tired and responding to that.  You can put a child to bed at 9:00 but<br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean that they are going to fall asleep at 9:00.  My<br/>
daughter Emily is the perfect example of that.  She is a night owl.<br/>
Was born a night owl.  Has always been a night owl.  Her energy rarely<br/>
gets running until mid afternoon and she is at her peak creativity<br/>
after 11pm.  For years we tried getting her to go to bed at a bedtime<br/>
because she needed to live in &quot;the real world.&quot;  (rolling eyes).  At<br/>
9:00 (or whatever her bedtime was) we would send her to bed.  She<br/>
would almost always still be awake at 11:00 when I would check on her<br/>
before going to sleep.  Then I would be dragging her out of bed at<br/>
6:00 am for school or when we stopped going to school around 8:00 so<br/>
she could have the whole day to do things.  Somehow I thought that if<br/>
I could get her in a habit of getting up earlier then she would have a<br/>
more &quot;normal&quot; schedule.  Now I know that what is &quot;normal&quot; for her is<br/>
this really weird (to me a morning person) schedule.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; What about insisting on respect from children (express yourself but<br/>
&gt; watch your tone kind of thing)? Is this also taboo?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wanting to be respected is not taboo.  *Expecting* someone, *anyone,*<br/>
is.  I want to be respected, but my children are not going to learn to<br/>
be respectful unless they are treated with respect first.  I was<br/>
channel flipping last night and came across an episode of The Nanny<br/>
(someone whose parenting philosophies I disagree with about 98% of the<br/>
time).  Anyway the family that she was working with showed a mom who<br/>
basically ignored her two children.  They sat in front of the tv all<br/>
day or played video games.  This would be fine in an unschooling<br/>
family with a mindful parent.  Then she decides that they need to do<br/>
something for her. I don&#39;t remember what, but the children are sitting<br/>
there watching tv and in the middle of the program the formerly<br/>
uninvolved parent turns off the tv and states that it is &quot;her way or<br/>
no way. Sorry tv is off, get over it.&quot; After this there comes a huge<br/>
fight where the son actually gets physical with the mom hitting her<br/>
and she leaves him in his room.  I think that I would be pretty ticked<br/>
too if someone had ignored me all day and then suddenly decided that<br/>
they were going to control my life, turning off something I was<br/>
engaged in and bullying me around being &quot;boss.&quot;  The mother showed NO<br/>
respect to these children and then got upset when her son showed her<br/>
no respect in return.  He didn&#39;t comply.  Children will not learn<br/>
respect if they, themselves, are not treated with respect.  Do you<br/>
want to be respectful to people who treat you poorly?<br/>
<br/>
I believe that my children have come to treat me with respect and<br/>
dignity because I have respected them, their needs and treated them as<br/>
loving whole people who have dreams, hopes and desires and helped them<br/>
in a achieving those things not because I gave them a list of rules to<br/>
teach them to &quot;respect their elders.&quot;  I also think that they are<br/>
respectful to most other people that they encounter.  I have seen my<br/>
children, on occasion, be disrespectful towards someone, but it would<br/>
be a case where I would probably end up being disrespectful as well  -<br/>
because they were not themselves being treated with respect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207762265">Okay...thanks. You know, I saw the Nanny episode last night (and the <br/>
one after it also) and spent a lot of time wondering where the mother <br/>
was and why she didn&#39;t just get them out more.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, I am glad to know that you don&#39;t stay silent when someone is <br/>
screaming at you. I take a very similar approach to how you handle <br/>
your son. I talk to her in similar ways and I understand she doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to be so angry. She has always been an intense child. I do try to <br/>
teach her healthy ways of handling her passion. I try to help her get <br/>
her head around what is going on and to think about if she finds her <br/>
reactions to be useful to her. She usually stops and we talk about how <br/>
to better handle it or to learn to let little things go. (she&#39;s pretty <br/>
hard on her little sister)<br/>
I teach her tricks that I had to learn on my own. It works.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BEDTIMES:<br/>
<br/>
I have a baby who is 1. I put him down at whatever time he gets fussy <br/>
in the evening which is usually between 7 and 8.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 3 year old who I will put down if he seems especially tired, <br/>
and I am tired, and we are all soon going to bed...and that is usually <br/>
about 8:30-9. Last night he fell asleep on me watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
My 6 year old and my 10 year old will get dressed for bed and usually <br/>
I have been directing them to bed between 8:30-9. Unless we are <br/>
watching something or have something to do and then when we are done, <br/>
they go to bed.<br/>
<br/>
I keep them pretty active and they usually fall asleep within a half <br/>
hour or so.<br/>
<br/>
So, since we aren&#39;t doing the school thing anymore, I have decided to <br/>
try taking away the bed times without telling them that&#39;s what I am <br/>
doing. Except for my 1 year old. <br/>
<br/>
I did that last night with my kids and my son fell alseep on me, my 6 <br/>
year old fell asleep on me, and my 10 year old went to be right after <br/>
I did. She asked me why I let her stay up. lol...she was totally <br/>
confused.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t force my kids to eat anything. <br/>
I don&#39;t force them to wear anything. <br/>
But we do agree on staying away from certain types of clothing.<br/>
I don&#39;t force them like everybody, but I do ask that they keep their <br/>
dignity and not result to intentionally insulting people.<br/>
I don&#39;t force school anymore.<br/>
I talk to them.<br/>
<br/>
Do unschoolers here have ANY rules at your house? Is the unschooling <br/>
life a life of zero rules? Or is it not forcing the issue on little <br/>
things like bed times or clothes or how much they eat?<br/>
<br/>
I am willing (and want) to try some things and test out these theories <br/>
and am willing to give it time. But I do have to understand what you <br/>
are talking about.<br/>
<br/>
I was under the impression that [for example] when your children <br/>
screamed at you, nothing was said and you just let them go without <br/>
addressing the issue. When does one childs &quot;freedom&quot; infringe on <br/>
another childs&#39; rights or even the parents&#39; rights? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to address my posts. :)</div>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>At exactly the same time that one adult&#39;s rights infringe on <br/>
another&#39;s. You can&#39;t yell Fire in a crowded theater. If your spouse <br/>
or SO yelled at you, what would you do? Apply that both ways: that <br/>
is, how would you respond to the yeller? And if you were doing the <br/>
yelling, how would your SO respond to you? We&#39;re just taking age out <br/>
of the equation and treating all persons in the household with <br/>
respect.<br/>
<br/>
As far as screaming (or hitting, kicking, whatever), sometimes that <br/>
is not the issue - it is a symptom. So, sending a child to their <br/>
room (or time out or whatever) does nothing to address the cause, <br/>
just the symptom. It&#39;s like sucking a Ricola cough drop for a <br/>
serious throat infection - it might calm the symptoms temporarily, <br/>
but the underlying issue is still there and will come back and more. <br/>
You may even do it enough that the child no longer screams at you - <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean the underlying issue is gone, just that they&#39;ve gotten <br/>
better at hiding or ignoring it. Sometimes it may look like the <br/>
screaming is not being addressed (because there&#39;s no one <br/>
saying &quot;Don&#39;t yell; go to your room&quot; etc). There have been times in <br/>
the past when my son hit me and I just hugged him and gave him a <br/>
kiss (I&#39;m sure there were people going &quot;what is she, nuts?&quot;). He <br/>
didn&#39;t need me to jump on him for hitting - he already felt bad. He <br/>
needed to know he was safe when those big feelings overwhelmed him. <br/>
Then we could talk and find out what was going on AND address <br/>
finding ways to deal with things that did not hurt others. I am his <br/>
partner in learning to deal with the world, not his adversary. Kids <br/>
come into the world fully equipped with a set of emotions. What they <br/>
don&#39;t have at that point are the skills to deal with expressing <br/>
those emotions in a manner that is safe for themselves and those <br/>
around them. That&#39;s where we come in. <br/>
<br/>
Another part of the situation is learning our kids. Knowing when a <br/>
situation is getting too overwhelming and they need help. Knowing <br/>
when something just is not a good idea and skipping it. Knowing that <br/>
he needs to eat every 3 hours even though he&#39;s now 8, not a <br/>
nursling. And so on. Rather than always reacting defensively, <br/>
working proactively together to not get into those situations in the <br/>
first place. And if they do arise, finding safe ways to vent those <br/>
emotions and move on.<br/>

  You can&#39;t insist on respect. You can earn it. You can *think* someone <br/>

 Have you read John Holt? He coined the word unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
  He wrote that he thought children were much brighter than adults give <br/>
them credit for. That they were capable of much more than adults think <br/>
they are. That they are generous and kind and want to learn to navigate <br/>
their world, but that adults seem to *need* to control them.<br/>
<br/>
  If you can trust them to learn academics, why do you feel you cannot <br/>
trust them to learn how to live in the world?<br/>

People have to *sleep* sometime. They never need to be in a bed! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
Duncan prefers the sofa.<br/>
<br/>
I had strict bedtimes as a child. I still have trouble falling asleep. <br/>
I lie there and think---just as I did as a child.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan, on the other hand, will fall asleep when he&#39;s tired.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m green with envy! &lt;g&gt; Is my insomnia due to my bedtime? Maybe. Is <br/>
his quick-to-sleep due to his lack of one?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s genetic.<br/>
<br/>
Hard to say. But I know I&#39;d spend hours and hours lying in bed before <br/>
I&#39;d get to sleep. And I still do most of the time. Although it seems to <br/>
be getting better as I change the way I look at the bed and sleep. <br/>
Luckily, Duncan will never have that issue.<br/>

&quot;guidelines&quot; than actual rules. Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss<br/>
Turner. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have &quot;guidelines&quot; in our house.  We agree to certain things like<br/>
treating each other with respect, helping when we can but<br/>
understanding that help isn&#39;t expected (such as in &quot;can you help me<br/>
with the dishes so we can get them done quicker so we can bake<br/>
cookies?&quot;)  Oh wait, we do have one rule, &quot;Keon flush the toilet!&quot;<br/>

says to me, but I might have a problem with HOW something is said to<br/>
me.  I always acknowledge anger, fear, sadness, happiness, etc when I<br/>
hear it, but that doesn&#39;t mean that I can be abused.  It&#39;s part of the<br/>
whole respect thing.  This also goes for parents as well.  Parents<br/>
can&#39;t yell at their children and expect their children to give them<br/>
the same respect back.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. There is no reason to put children to bed when they are not <br/>
tired.<br/>
But<br/>
I have 3 kids under 6. I use clues for them like; my one year old <br/>
gets fussy between 7-8. If i put him down, he goes right to sleep. <br/>
My 3 year old frequently asks to go to bed if I don&#39;t put him down <br/>
soon enough. Last night he just fell asleep on me. He had all the <br/>
tired clues. He never lasts past 9. So when I put him to bed, it&#39;s <br/>
usually about 8:30-9. If he gets up, I let him get up.<br/>
My six year old gets tired at the same time. sh eeither falls asleep <br/>
on me or she tells me she is tired and goes to bed. There are also <br/>
times when I say &quot;bed time&quot; and she just goes to bed and right to <br/>
sleep. The time she falls asleep on me is the same time I would tell <br/>
her to go to bed.<br/>
I have seen my oldest daughter lay in bed awake. So, because of <br/>
advice here, I will let her stay up until she gets tired. I trust <br/>
her to know when she&#39;s tired.<br/>

I can see the level of dirt that would accumlate if I assumed my 6 and <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly - calls to mind something going on today at home. DS got one <br/>
of those cheap plastic bristle dart games somewhere (forget why or <br/>
where). He fell in love with it. However, the bristle started <br/>
breaking making it even harder to get the silly darts to stick. Last <br/>
night, while Ds was at MIL&#39;s as usual, DH and I stopped in to a <br/>
sporting goods place to browse the kayaks (we&#39;re considering getting <br/>
a couple - they&#39;re way easier to manage/transport than our current <br/>
large canoe). While we were there, we passed the regular dartboards <br/>
and DH mentioned how much DS liked the little dartboard but how hard <br/>
it was getting with the broken bits. We looked at the selection and <br/>
picked an inexpensive, electronic, soft tip set (weighted like <br/>
regular darts but with plastic tips - can&#39;t pierce skin but would <br/>
hurt if hit hard with one). We set it in the back seat of the car <br/>
and headed to pick DS up. We hung around and chatted a bit as usual <br/>
then told DS there was a surprise in the car for him. He said his <br/>
goodbyes and headed to the car. When he saw what it was he gasped in <br/>
glee, jumped back out of the car and wrapped a big hug around me. <br/>
Then I said &quot;Daddy told me how much you liked the dart game and how <br/>
it was getting broken&quot; so he ran over to DH (who was still on the <br/>
sidewalk near the house, I was right at the car already) and gave <br/>
him a massive hug and thank you (which DH loved - I could see *him* <br/>
light up as well as DS&#39; major glow of glee - being able to do stuff <br/>
like this for DS, getting things he would enjoy &quot;just because&quot; not <br/>
for any &quot;reason&quot; or anything he earned, is really healing for DH). <br/>
Anyhow, long story longer, by the time we got home, we set about <br/>
getting the batteries in and reading a bit of how to operate the <br/>
electronic settings. Then it was getting late (I need to get to be <br/>
so I can be up for work in the a.m) and DH wanted to be able to <br/>
clean and rearrange the basement &#39;rec room&#39; area in order to make a <br/>
proper space to hang the dartboard. So, he told DS that he would be <br/>
cleaning and organizing the area in order to hang the board in the <br/>
morning. If he wanted to, DS could help with it which would help <br/>
things get done faster so they could play sooner. I&#39;m guessing <br/>
they&#39;re already done and playing as I type.<br/>
<br/>
One recent humorous bit is that DS has taken a liking to the weed <br/>
whacker for some reason. About two weeks ago, DH asked if DS would <br/>
like to weed whack while he (DH) was cutting some branches and doing <br/>
other yard work. DS said Sure! and got dressed, got his sunglasses <br/>
as eye protection and DH showed him how to safely use the thing. He <br/>
did about an hour that day and has done about an hour or so in <br/>
smaller bits since then without us mentioning a word. Last Saturday, <br/>
after he finished breakfast he said &quot;I want to do some weed whacking <br/>
so I&#39;m going to go get dressed&quot; and off he went... No expectation, <br/>
just opportunities presented.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No they don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; be done - you could choose to make a home for <br/>
fruit flies (maybe make extra income by selling them to genetics labs -<br/>
 they&#39;re always experimenting on fruit flies lol). You could choose to <br/>
pay someone to come in and clean. You could choose not to buy bananas. <br/>
You could choose to not have beds with an &quot;under&quot; for things to get to <br/>
(DS&#39; has a &quot;mate&#39;s bed&quot; which has drawers underneath so there&#39;s no way <br/>
for stuff to get &quot;under&quot; the bed - it&#39;s a big box with a mattress on <br/>
top). You could choose a lot of things besides cleaning under the <br/>
beds. <br/>
<br/>
So when you say &quot;Yes I do things I don&#39;t choose to do&quot; that&#39;s not <br/>
quite accurate - you CHOOSE to do things that might not be your <br/>
favorite things to do because you dislike the consequences more than <br/>
you dislike the activity involved. You dislike fruit flies more than <br/>
you dislike cleaning under the bed - so you choose the cleaning. You <br/>
could choose the fruit flies. It&#39;s ALL choice.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think that in our culture, having a choice means picking <br/>
things we like when really it just means there are two or more options <br/>
to the situation - and there are very few situations that have no <br/>
options (dying is one). Even paying taxes is a choice - you can be <br/>
a &quot;tax resister&quot; and risk going to jail and having property seized. <br/>
You can move to someplace that has no income tax. And so on. I&#39;ve even <br/>
considered on occasion moving to NH where there&#39;s no sales tax - but <br/>
(a) there&#39;s more homeschool regulation than here in CT (b) they have a <br/>
hefty &#39;entertainment tax&#39; and we really like movies and dining out. <br/>
So, we CHOOSE to stay in CT because the lack of state intervention in <br/>
our unschooling lives really overrides the rest. <br/>
<br/>
Choices are everywhere. And, it really changes my whole outlook when I <br/>
recognize that. I don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do the dishes ... but I like having <br/>
a clean, non-smelly, non-buggy kitchen and making it an active choice <br/>
empowers me rather than giving the dishes the power to change my <br/>
outlook. So, I choose to do the dishes, I select a dish liquid that I <br/>
like (the orange cleaners are nice - clean well and smell great). I <br/>
sometimes put on some music. More often I use it as quiet thinking <br/>
time. <br/>

<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 But you&#39;re CHOOSING to do it, right? Or is someone making you?<br/>
<br/>
  Seriously, choosing to see the things we do as choices is powerful! It <br/>
*will* change your life and the lives of those around you. I choose to <br/>
do all sorts of weird and difficult things because it makes me feel <br/>
good afterwards or I get some kind of sick thrill out of seeing the <br/>
poop scooped or the lawn mowed or the happy faces of conference <br/>
attendees! &lt;bwg&gt; I don&#39;t do them because I *have* to, but because I <br/>
*choose* to.<br/>
<br/>
  I could get a maid to come in weekly. I could eat of paper plates and <br/>
napkins. I *choose* to clean my house because then I know where things <br/>
are. I choose to wash dishes because I don&#39;t like throwing a bunch of <br/>
plastic in the landfills. I choose to wash cotton napkins rather than <br/>
condemn a tree. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Changing the way I looked at these things was easier than I thought it <br/>
would be. Rather than huffing about having to fold laundry---aGAIN---I <br/>
took a deep breath and noticed how big the boys have grown. I grew <br/>
wistful thinking about the tiny little t-shirts they used to wear. <br/>
Rather than moan---aGAIN---about washing dishes when the dishwasher was <br/>
broken, I started thinking about my favorite dishes or what all we had <br/>
for supper. Rather than bitch--aGAIN---about cleaning the boys&#39; rooms, <br/>
I think about Lisa Strebler, Joanna Wlikinson, and Diana Jenner, who <br/>
each lost a child. That really puts everything into perspective. <br/>
Quickly!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I quite frequently clean it for them. Sometimes what we do is trade. I<br/>
 do their room (because they like that the least) and they clean<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
  I can do laundry to the last bit. I hate to put it away. I can do the <br/>
dishes to the last bit. I hate to put them away. Cameron likes to put <br/>
both away. Lucky me! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  One of the side benefits of seeing what we do as choices and not <br/>
chores is that our children do too. If we approach dirty or difficult <br/>
things in our lives as things we CHOOSE to do---JOYFULLY, rather than <br/>
with anger or bitterness---so will our children!<br/>
<br/>
 HUGE side benefit! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
