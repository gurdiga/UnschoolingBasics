hi,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ive forwarded this to a few people who have previously commented on the parenting pit, hope you dont mind getting it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is my shameless attempt to find somewhere to stay in New York when i am there at the end of the month. I will be there without my family so im hoping to find a couch or the like to stay on while I explore the city. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i dont know anyone in new york (which is odd since its so bloody big) but six degrees of separation and all... i thought you might? If you do and they might be able to put up with a very house trained guest for a few days, please do forward this email to them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

<br/>
hello,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
im an unschooling dad from australia.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i will be in New York for 4 days at the end of the month (without my kids which is both scary & exciting).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will be there from Oct 27 to Oct 31st. Its my first time in New York and i&#39;m very open to ideas of what to do & see. I&#39;m also keen to meet up with unschooling bods in the area if anything is happening during <br/>
those dates. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And of course if anyone happens to have a free couch for me to sleep on for that time id be eternally grateful  ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but in any case, please let me know of any meet ups & any tips on what to see and do for that period. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rather than clogging up this list with stuff – if it&#39;s more appropriate please feel free to email me direct or comment on my blog.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
all the best<br/>
