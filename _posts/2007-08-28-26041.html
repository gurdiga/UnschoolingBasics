<br/>
I have a 2 year old and a 4-almost-5 year old I am nursing :)<br/>
 <br/>
Portuguese! What a LOVELY language! It&#39;s so pretty, and a cousin to my DH&#39;s  <br/>
Spanish :) Or perhaps a sister! <br/>
 <br/>
I have a friend elsewhere on the &#39;net that speaks it. It&#39;s so nicee to hear  <br/>
it. I love languages and could sit and hear ones I don&#39;t know all <br/>
day...Spanish  with my DH, Tagalog with my smom and her mom and...lol...Balmerese with my  <br/>
grandparents! lol! (Baltimorons know that language, lol)<br/>
 <br/>
Love and thanks, Alex! <br/>
