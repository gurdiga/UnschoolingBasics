<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711498286">&quot;Or, &quot;Why would sailors be singing about Santa Anna?&quot;<br/>
Rowan and I  will continue to be casting sideways winks and grins at each<br/>
other every time another and another thread of this unit pops up though out<br/>
everyday life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why would real life need to be called a &quot;unit&quot; though?<br/>
That&#39;s a school thing.<br/>
Of course you&#39;re going to notice bits of information popping up all over now, because you are aware of this. It&#39;s called CONNECTIONS!:)<br/>
The way human beings learn BEST....it&#39;s all those darn connections we can&#39;t help making once we learn something new and meaningful to our lives.<br/>
Why is that a &quot;unit&quot;? It&#39;s not. It&#39;s real life, it&#39;s learning and it&#39;s exploring the world.<br/>
A Unit, is when the teacher or student picks a topic, and then comes up with lessons in all subjects, centered around that topic.<br/>
Unschoolers don&#39;t need to turn things into lessons.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean our children won&#39;t pursue some very academic or schoolish looking subjects....or even pour themselves into studying something intensely.  But as parents, I don&#39;t think we are de-schooled, if we think that an interest means we come up with lessons or workbooks as our first reaction to the interest.<br/>
Exploring an interest around here does not involve lessons of any kind, it means learning about the interest in a variety of methods, all involving real life use. That doesn&#39;t mean the child won&#39;t want formal studies in the topic eventually, but that certainly isn&#39;t our job as unschooling parents-to find lessons based on interest.<br/>
<br/>
For example, Trevor became very interested in computers last year. My reaction? To help him find a mentor that he could hang out with, work with, learn from in order to get started. I brought up the idea to him, and he was thrilled. We found an unschooling Dad/computer whiz that was equally excited to work with an interested teen.<br/>
He helped Trevor get a bunch of computer parts to muck about with, gave him some books and was available when questions arose. Trevor has built his own computer and continues to learn and be excited about his interest. No lessons. No one telling him what to learn or what to do....just being available and making reccomendations based on his experience.<br/>
Very cool situation. Eventually, Trevor may take some formal classes. He talks about getting some kind of degree in computer technology...he has plans to create the next BIG anti-virus software. In the mean time, he&#39;s a 14 y.o. kid, having fun with what he loves and playing a LOT of video games.:) I don&#39;t feel the need to create &quot;units&quot; or studies or lessons of any kind based on their passions.<br/>
I don&#39;t think until a person let&#39;s go of that idea, will unschooling be as bubbly and swirly and wonderful as it possibly could be....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-359964332">It&#39;s all just semantics, in this case, imho.  If a child *choosing* to go to<br/>
school of their own free will is still and unschooler.  Then I child choosing<br/>
to do a &quot;unit study&quot; because of their interest in something is too.  We all<br/>
have a way we approach learning.  It&#39;s ok if we don&#39;t word it just right, isn&#39;t<br/>
it?<br/>

<br/>
My family is vegetarian.  If my child chooses of his own free will to <br/>
start eating meat, is he still a vegetarian?<br/>
<br/>
If I planned a homebirth, but then chose to birth at a hospital then <br/>
it&#39;s OK to tell everyone that I had a homebirth because the intent was <br/>
there?<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t make any sense.  Unschooling is what it is -- NOT <br/>
schooling.  Not attending a school, not having assignments, no tests or <br/>
quizzes or book reports or a teacher or a pupil or grades or semesters <br/>
or school years or anything resembling *school*.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a page on the definitions of unschooling from various people <br/>
that some of you might find helpful:<br/>

Also, what was really helpful for me in letting go of all the schoolish <br/>
BS that was crammed into my head for 13+ years is this page on <br/>

 </span></blockquote>To me, vegetarianism and homebirthing are something<br/>
you *DO*, but unschooling is about a control shift,<br/>
from ME or A TEACHER or someone else deciding what&#39;s<br/>
right for a child, to EVERY PERSON deciding what&#39;s<br/>
right for themselves.  *I* see *NO* merrit in<br/>
schooling, public or otherwise, but I see the<br/>
possibility of schooling in &quot;unschooling&quot; if that is<br/>
what a person wants for themselves.  The ability to<br/>
take classes as they fit their lifestyle and needs,<br/>
and equally the ability to leave just as easily if it<br/>
stops meeting their needs.  But maybe what I&#39;m<br/>
describing isn&#39;t &quot;unschooling&quot;, maybe it&#39;s the control<br/>
shift that is often called unschooling but is actually<br/>
that broader, autanomous life for everyone in a<br/>
household that grows from unschooling....<br/>
