<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022571789">Okay, I have 4 kids ages 9, 7, 4.5, & 1.5. We have done attachment<br/>
parenting since birth and that and my daughter&#39;s own desire led us to<br/>
unschooling. I didn&#39;t want to spend 8 hours away from her and felt<br/>
that if she was going to be taught then I would be the best person to<br/>
do that. Now I feel that it is the opposite and she is my teacher and<br/>
I the student and that works pretty well. She just learns what she<br/>
wants to and the others follow suit. We have never done a curriculum<br/>
and we don&#39;t want to. We have just let her and our subsiquent children<br/>
just live in our lives an be completely present and welcome there. But<br/>
over the last 4 years I had been sinking deeper and deeper into a<br/>
terrible depression, winters are always harder. We moved to a<br/>
different house, in the city instead of in the country where I had<br/>
started to feel really isolated, we lived there for 5 years: 4 months<br/>
ago we moved and that helped a lot. And recently I found out that I<br/>
have severe hypothyroidism. So I am starting a holistic treatment plan<br/>
I had made for my mom last year when she was diagnosed and she<br/>
wouldn&#39;t do it so... I should be improving soon. It has been hard on<br/>
the kids and my marriage. But thankfully my marriage survived and is<br/>
now better than ever, but with the kids it is so hard to get back to<br/>
that place we were. One thing I have tried and am working on is just<br/>
DECIDING that I will be a joyful parent and finding more joy in daily<br/>
life. That has helped a bunch but man it is hard to get 5 ppl fed(my<br/>
husband fends for himself) with no $, and play and wash clothes(we<br/>
don&#39;t really clean so that is about it).<br/>
Anyway, I have really dug myself into a hole with my kids. I have not<br/>
treated them very well in the last year or two especially. I get angry<br/>
very easily and I am always incredibly tired. <br/>
I want to know what are some concrete steps I can do to start<br/>
connecting with them on the level we used to and maybe they need a<br/>
little demommying;).  I am with them all the time but things right now<br/>
are really drawn on the line of kids on one side and adults the other.<br/>
There didn&#39;t used to be a line but now it is hard to cross. Also, we<br/>
get a lot of flack from the homeschoolers in our town because they<br/>
feel since my oldest isn&#39;t reading yet (9yrs) then unschooling doesn&#39;t<br/>
work. I don&#39;t believe this but also I feel that I have not been<br/>
playing, reading, strewing, exploring, enough with them. I have kind<br/>
of forgotten how. I am just so tired all the time, I get really<br/>
overwhelmed with things. I am starting a unschooling group in my area.<br/>
There are only 3 or 4 of us that I know of but I am sure it will grow.<br/>
I want the kids to have a core group that we can rely on not to judge<br/>
us.  <br/>
Any advice?<br/>

 <br/>
Maybe start small.  See what they are interested in right now and  ask a <br/>
question or find something cool that relates to that.  They may see  your interest <br/>
as wanting to reconnect.  Maybe talking to them.   Explain about your thyroid <br/>
problems and how that has made you feel, how it has  sort of controlled your <br/>
mood, your behavior etc and that you want to change all  that.  That you want <br/>
to reconnect with them, etc.  Also maybe finding  your own interest or passion <br/>
and taking some time for that.  <br/>
 <br/>
Also I know an unschooling friend who is also working  with a thyroid <br/>
problem.  She does know what it is like to have no energy  etc.  So if you would like <br/>
to talk with her just let me know and I will put  you in touch.  Sometimes it <br/>
helps to know you are not  alone.<br/>

Sorry I don&#39;t have time to answer &#39;cause it would be long. I think once you are physically and mentally ( less stress too!) strong again it will all come back to you.<br/>
Take care of you and get well...it will follow.<br/>
You already have the consciousness and that is the big step.<br/>
I am going thru something similar ( different reasons and ailments) but I am getting better.<br/>
But we got to work hard at getting the body  healed and strong for our beautiful kids.<br/>

<br/>
Deciding to find the beauty and joy in the moment is huge!<br/>
I think you&#39;re on the right track.<br/>
<br/>
When money is tight, we try to find joy in the simple things....a loaf<br/>
of homemade bread makes me feel so abundant, even without much in the<br/>
bank.:) Try to connect with the things in life that help you focus on<br/>
ABUNDANCE rather than lack.  What makes you feel luxurious? A warm<br/>
bubble bath with candles lit?  Some soft music and a good book? A<br/>
nighttime walk? A cuppa tea sitting in the morning sunshine?  A romp<br/>
in the park or trip to the library where you revel in all the<br/>
wonderful things we have access to for FREE?<br/>
<br/>
Take some time for yourself, to reconnect with your inner child (I<br/>
know, I know...overused term but still useful) and with that which<br/>
brings joy.<br/>
Watch your children&#39;s faces, see the light in their eyes and remind<br/>
yourself how incredibly blessed you are to have them healthy and whole<br/>
and WITH you today. Every moment that they are making messes or<br/>
fighting or needing you, is a moment they are alive and well. They<br/>
aren&#39;t in the hospital with tubes down their throats or on breathing<br/>
machines...that is worth celebrating!<br/>
<br/>
The sun rose today, the stars are out tonight, notice these things and<br/>
take pleasure in them. Inspire yourself with new ideas, lists of fun<br/>
things to do, projects that sound fun, but if none of that gets<br/>
accomplished today, it&#39;s OK.<br/>
Go into the day with only the expectation that you will make the best<br/>
of each moment, even the rough ones. Trust that you will all find your<br/>
way back to health, wholeness and happiness. Just connect with your<br/>
child&#39;s joy in each moment and know that ALL IS WELL.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helps me a lot is something we talked about at the<br/>
conference often....SELF-COMPASSION. We all talk about being gentle<br/>
and respectful to our children, but are we gentle with ourselves? Most<br/>
people don&#39;t have a very gentle or respectful way of dialoguing with<br/>
themselves. Change that. Give yourself loving, kind messages. When you<br/>
screw up, talk positive in your mind. Every experience is a chance to<br/>
learn and do better....so give yourself the gift of self-love. That<br/>
will better equip you to infect your home with the spirit of LOVE.:)<br/>
It IS contagious.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy the website soulfulliving.com for inspiration. Take some time<br/>
to connect with you today, to connect with your children&#39;s joyful<br/>
moments and let go of everything that doesn&#39;t really matter (no, the<br/>
mess doesn&#39;t really matter, you will get to it after they&#39;re asleep or<br/>
happily engaged).<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-305750302">**But over the last 4 years I had been sinking deeper and deeper into<br/>
a terrible depression, winters are always harder. **<br/>
<br/>
I tend to get some seasonal depression myself, and for me I think it<br/>
is linked to the lack of sunshine.  (It&#39;s foggy for a big chunk of the<br/>
day here in the winter.)  I do know that positive thinking can be a<br/>
big help for depression.  I&#39;m a pretty big believer in cognitive<br/>
therapy, and I like the book by David Burns, _Feeling Good, the New<br/>
Mood Therapy_.<br/>
<br/>
When you say you plan to treat your thyroid condition &quot;holistically&quot;<br/>
do you mean that you don&#39;t want to take medication?  (I&#39;m reading a<br/>
lot into what you said, and maybe that&#39;s not what you meant.)  If you<br/>
are avoiding the thyroid replacement hormones is it because your<br/>
toddler is still nursing, or because you don&#39;t have health insurance?<br/>
 (Or you don&#39;t want to take hormones extracted from pigs because of<br/>
ethical concerns?  I figure that wouldn&#39;t stop you from taking the<br/>
synthetic version.)<br/>
<br/>
*If* you have a diagnosed thyroid condition that your doctor is<br/>
recommending treating with pills, I would strongly encourage you to<br/>
take them.  Having all the hormones that your body needs can make a<br/>
tremendous difference in how well you feel and how much energy you<br/>
have.  And I believe that having more energy can greatly improve your<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
I will acknowledge that I haven&#39;t researched holistic thyroid<br/>
treatment myself, so I&#39;m not in any way an expert.  Most of my<br/>
information comes to me second hand from a friend who had her thyroid<br/>
removed last year.  Of course it is necessary for her to artificially<br/>
replace what would normally be produced by her thyroid.  In her<br/>
situation, lots of positive thinking and a healthy diet would not<br/>
increase the output of her thyroid.  (I do understand that your<br/>
situation is different.)<br/>
<br/>
I know that there are thyroid disease support groups on the internet<br/>
in which people share what has and hasn&#39;t worked for them.  If you<br/>
haven&#39;t researched that already, I encourage you to check it out and<br/>
connect with some of the people in those online groups and discuss<br/>
what kind of results they are seeing from different treatments.<br/>
<br/>
I know advice can sound like criticism when you feel exhausted.  I<br/>
really don&#39;t mean to sound harsh.  I&#39;m concerned about you and your<br/>
kids, and wish I had a magic wand or potion to make your life easier.<br/>
 I like to think that thyroid medicine might work that well for you. <br/>
To me, it seems like it&#39;s worth a try.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

couple more years. Synthroid does go through to your milk but is<br/>
supposedly harmless. REALLY, I would rather not take that chance. I<br/>
have a lot of family members on Synthroid and other thyroid medication<br/>
and they have a lot of side effects and have been told they can never<br/>
go off of it with out complications. Also, I have had heart issues in<br/>
the past(cleared up when I was pregnant with 1st child)  and they<br/>
don&#39;t like to prescribe thyroid meds for ppl with any kind of heart<br/>
condition. <br/>
We also do not see doctors so we do not have health insurance, we have<br/>
emergency insurance in case we need to go to the hospital but we<br/>
usually see a chiropractor/accupuncturist. Now I just found out about<br/>
the thyroid condition and I have not been to my chiro yet. But I will<br/>
and we will come up with a good plan, together.<br/>

&gt; in which people share what has and hasn&#39;t worked for them.  If you<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t researched that already, I encourage you to check it out and<br/>
&gt; connect with some of the people in those online groups and discuss<br/>
&gt; what kind of results they are seeing from different treatments.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know advice can sound like criticism when you feel exhausted.  I<br/>
&gt; really don&#39;t mean to sound harsh.  I&#39;m concerned about you and your<br/>
&gt; kids, and wish I had a magic wand or potion to make your life easier.<br/>
&gt;  I like to think that thyroid medicine might work that well for you. <br/>
&gt; To me, it seems like it&#39;s worth a try.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t think you sounded critical at all, your post was very<br/>
helpful, if anything it really reminded me of all the trouble my<br/>
mother has had with her thyroid medication and it really makes me know<br/>
I want to at least try to do this completely naturally. I couldn&#39;t<br/>
afford meds for the rest of my life. Things are getting better.<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
