<div id="ygrps-yiv-698452334">~&gt; &quot;The world is round. Sail as far as you will in search of truth. You<br/>
will encounter storms; you may be wrecked. But in the long run, the<br/>
universe is on the side of those who trust their own minds, value<br/>
supremely their own experiences, and dare to sail under their own, true<br/>
colors.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; UU Minister: Harry Scholefield~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Connections, connections. Yesterday, I received a very special gift<br/>
from a dear woman and I sat to read it tonight. It&#39;s about William<br/>
Copperthwaite, a man that believed in living simply and close to the<br/>
earth. His work is so inspirational to me.<br/>
Anyway, the above quote made me think of the opening quote in the book:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The main thrust of my work is not simple living--not yurt design, not<br/>
social change, although each of these is important and receives large<br/>
blocks of my time. But they are not central.  My central concern is<br/>
encouragement--encouraging people to seek, to experiment, to plan, to<br/>
create, and to dream.  If enough people do this we will find a better<br/>
way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The book is titled &quot;A Handmade Life&quot; with photographs by Peter Forbes. <br/>
Awesome stuff.:)<br/>
