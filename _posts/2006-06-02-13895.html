<br/>
  My bil has great shops in Tarpon Springs &quot;Five Fish.&quot;  There are two shops. <br/>
  One across from the shops and the other near the aquarium.  This would fall<br/>
  in the category of &quot;snazzy&quot; stuff.  Also - be sure to sample the great greek<br/>
  food in the neighborhood.  Or the florida fruit wines (another shop of bil -<br/>
  near the aquarium.)  There is a candle making shop near the aquarium that is<br/>
  also fun to visit.<br/>
<br/>
  If your looking for something fun to do - try letterboxing in St Petersburg.<br/>
  We found an old indian site that was nestled in a suburban neighborhood. <br/>
  Great short little adventure.  Or one of my favorite places in St Petes is<br/>
  the St Petersburg Clay Company.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stpeteclay.com/">http://www.stpeteclay.com/</a><br/>
  There are also a few great needlepoint shops in St Petes.  And the Dali<br/>
  Museum.  Also the aquarium in Tampa is fun.  One day is not enough time.<br/>
<br/>
  Have fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603583890">Geocaching is somewhat like letterboxing---someone hides a sort of<br/>
&quot;treasure&quot; box somewhere---and uses a GPS system to plot the coordinates,<br/>
then they go to the geocaching website and put in the coordinates and clues<br/>
as to where the box is hidden.  Then, you take your GPS (global positioning<br/>
system, just in case you didn&#39;t know :-) and the clues and you try to find<br/>
the box.  Usually, you would take something out of the box, and leave<br/>
something else behind.  There are also usually logs in the box to put your<br/>
email addy and name and any comments and sometimes they even leave a<br/>
disposible camera so anyone who finds the box can take their picture.  Then,<br/>
you hide the box where you found it and go on to the next hunt!  We started<br/>
doing this about 10 years ago and there weren&#39;t too many caches in our area,<br/>
now there are hundreds, possibly thousands!  It&#39;s a lot of fun---and it gets<br/>
the kids out of the house on a family adventure!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-320927387">Just a warning....geocaching can be quite addictive!!! LOL  When we started, we would spend all weekend, every weekend, hunting down caches. ;o)  We&#39;ve even placed a few of our own.  It&#39;s fun to see the log entries on the site and read about people&#39;s adventures trying to find your cache.<br/>
<br/>
It is a GREAT way to find all sorts of really cool out of the way places.  When we go on roadtrips, we always print out a bunch of geocache listings and cache our way to and from our location.  It makes the trips more enjoyable and gives us an excuse to stop and stretch their legs.  We&#39;ve found the most amazing places in Alaska because we geocache. :o)<br/>
