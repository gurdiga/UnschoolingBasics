Yeah, leaving does seem like a good thing to do. The only problem is that<br/>
this is the group I started. I have worked my ass off for 3 years building<br/>
the group. But I think I have lost it now anyway ... Have you ever had a<br/>
meeting like you suggest?<br/>

turn out well. If they (or even just a handful) come hostile it could  <br/>
be an even bigger drain. It&#39;s *very* hard to convince people who are  <br/>
determined not to understand.<br/>
<br/>
Think about observing a parent who seems to you to be totally  <br/>
clueless on how to raise a child. Then think of that parent inviting   <br/>
you to hear why they parent as they do. Wouldn&#39;t you very likely see  <br/>
it as an opportunity to set her straight?<br/>

Find other friends.  And chances are they will start finding ways to  not be <br/>
around you so they may do that for you.  KWIM.  They don&#39;t be  friends you see <br/>
regularly any more.   Believe me, been there done that  and it has led me to <br/>
some really great, really cool friends.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I personally believe they have a right to parent the way  they feel is best <br/>
for their family, and so do I.  I really like being  around families that <br/>
parent similarly.  <br/>
 <br/>
So consider it a great opportunity for growth.  I  would suggest looking for <br/>
those like minded families now so your children can  start making more friends <br/>
before the current circle pulls away.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had the same splintering of my core group of friends. When the kids<br/>
were small, I thought sure this would be my tribe forever, afterall, these<br/>
were my LLL friends who introduced me to things like homeschooling and<br/>
Mothering magazine.<br/>
These fading friendships led to other, newer, better-for-who-I-am-now,<br/>
contacts, which led to more, which led to.... (you get the idea ;)<br/>
Not only because of whole-life unschooling, also because of major life<br/>
upheavals I had that they didn&#39;t want to face or deal with. It was painful,<br/>
sad. And in hindsight, I was surrounded by and supported by, and continue to<br/>
be, by the exact folks I need. And they are too.<br/>
How cool you started a group that now works better for them than you... Go<br/>
make another one, you&#39;re good at it :D Consider it a gift to them and to<br/>
their children.<br/>
I started a full moon circle of women. I thought it was what I needed. Turns<br/>
out it wasn&#39;t; it *was* what they needed. So it&#39;s theirs now and I&#39;m so glad<br/>
to have been the catalyst.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029847943">I knew you&#39;d have excellent words of wisdom to share here, Diana!<br/>
<br/>
 I often feel like it&#39;s just such a struggle, living this Radical way.  It<br/>
is the only way, though, for us to live.  I know that in my heart of<br/>
hearts.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t make it sting any less when people *seem* to hate you or your<br/>
children.  Just had an encounter today, where a mom (and a friend of mine)<br/>
said to me, VERY EMOTIONALLY, &quot;I don&#39;t appreciate it when S says &quot;i&#39;m going<br/>
to kill you&quot;, it pisses me off&quot;.  Youch.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I sat with that for the afternoon.  I could see she wouldn&#39;t want<br/>
someone saying that to her child.  I sent her love and understanding.  (and<br/>
also kept my mouth shut after she&#39;d said that).  I know my child isn&#39;t going<br/>
to go off and kill someone, and I&#39;m sure she knows it too, she just jumped<br/>
right into an old familiar tape.   But I also refuse to start blaming or<br/>
punishing.  Just not gonna happen.  I&#39;d rather be there to help my kids, and<br/>
*everyone else&#39;s kids* navigate through their little moments.  Sure does<br/>
help when others come at it the same way, but it doesn&#39;t always happen.<br/>
<br/>
After we&#39;d returned home, she called me.  She apologized for reacting the<br/>
way she did.  She admitted that there was obviously much more that went on,<br/>
but that she just reacted like the mama tiger when her little girl came<br/>
running to her crying.<br/>
<br/>
All is as it should be...<br/>
