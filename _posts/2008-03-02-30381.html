<div id="ygrps-yiv-862600501">I think it is pretty clear that they were singled out for being at the very least homophobic and probably even a little bit xenophobic which are both undesirable traits in a society. Which makes this a clear case of society forcing it&#39;s self upon the people. That is why I&#39;m nearly completely purposely Anti-Social. And yes I think others will be targeted soon, because as we all know, the govt ain&#39;t got nothin better to do! As far as them specifically accusing the umbrella as being inadequate, well that is what will get this case turned over since it is an obvious error on their parts for not properly interpreting the law or possibly even being ignorant of the law.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-204511726">***Which makes this a clear case of society<br/>
forcing it&#39;s self upon the people. ***<br/>
<br/>
&quot;People&quot; make up the &quot;society.&quot;   If social conscience did not moved us so, slavery would have continued even longer than it did.  Women and minorities would have been further delayed the right to vote.  <br/>
Even more Native American children might have been taken from their parents to be &quot;educated.&quot;   Children might have been forced into factory labor for more years than they were.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe our social conscience will eventually make hitting children unacceptable. That&#39;s alright by me. <br/>
<br/>
Humans are imperfect but their ideas continue to evolve and that &quot;should&quot; have an effect on other humans.  Part of what we believe as unschoolers is that our kids learn from living with us.  We all learn from living in the world of humans and were supposed to.  We&#39;re built to learn from each other. <br/>
<br/>
I think schools are mostly crummy places where learning does not thrive but if a person&#39;s chief complaint against school is that something might go on there that might make his kids think, that worries me more than the schools worry me.   Boy howdy.<br/>
<br/>
Some people think society&#39;s conventions should have no bearing on how they raise their kids.  Some people think it&#39;s ok to keep kids in cages, or chained in their beds, or to not give them food if they &quot;disobey&quot; too. <br/>
<br/>
And, as to the subject line; We&#39;re *all* mandated to put our kids in school in this country.  Some manage to exempt them successfully.   (I will refrain from elaborating about those who don&#39;t.)<br/>

  &quot;When they are much more mature, they can deal with these issues, alternative lifestyles, and such, or whether they came from primordial slop. At the present time it&#39;s my job to teach them the correct way of thinking,&quot; he said.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  Ok I do think children belong with their parents and enjoy my right to let my children have their own opinion in these matters and discuss how I dont think being christian gives me the right to judge other peoples beliefs. But ouch! ....&quot;Its my job to teach them the correct way of thinking!!??&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640867490">Well, so new info has surfaced about this. Apparently it was the older <br/>
son who called CPS because of abuse from the father. Convenient how <br/>
that was left out of the article above.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I don&#39;t agree with what many people do, I also do not agree <br/>
in forcing anyone to accept what we all see as truth. Inspire, don&#39;t <br/>
require. Mandation is not required to overcome the stufling <br/>
stereotypes. The next generation is doing that without being forced to. <br/>
<br/>
But I still think this court case could mean big things for Cali HSing <br/>
law - either good or bad, I&#39;m not sure which.<br/>
<br/>
Oh here&#39;s the other info regarding this case that states the rest of <br/>
the info. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/B192878.PDF">http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/B192878.PDF</a><br/>
<br/>
In it, very little is mentioned about the parents reason for <br/>
homeschooling being gay lifestyles taught in school. It sounds like it <br/>
was just religious conviction (which undoubtly encompassed what the gay <br/>
rights issue, however I think the article emphasized it a bit much).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as a Libertarian, this kind stuff worries me. It is not <br/>
constitutional to step on parental rights. And although this situation <br/>
is different because of the allegations of abuse, I certainly hope it <br/>
doesn&#39;t set a precedent for future cases. One step closer to a fascist <br/>
state.<br/>

Once abuse is alleged, *especially* by a child, the issue ends as a<br/>
homeschool one and becomes a human rights issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-999039548">I don&#39;t know if many people know this, but social conscience had nothing<br/>
to do with the abolition of slavery.  Our economy did.  It was<br/>
impossible to incorporate a capitalistic economy that relies on supply<br/>
and demand without abolishing slavery, because wages are also supposed<br/>
to be determined by supply and demand, and free labor would throw off<br/>
everything.  It&#39;s the same reason we used to give away wheat to the<br/>
Soviet Union back in the day.  They weren&#39;t part of the capitalist world<br/>
economy, thus giving them wheat wouldn&#39;t upset the value of wheat.<br/>
Almost every law, policy, treaty, war is rooted in economics.  Now,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-235900081">*** and yes social conscience is what led the <br/>
way in re-establishing the rights of women and minorities.***<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a reestablishment of voting rights it was finally a granting of rights.  <br/>
<br/>
***Social Conscience is fickle at best***<br/>
<br/>
At it&#39;s best social conscience can bring about positive change.   It&#39;s not always at it&#39;s best.  But we&#39;re not so fickle that we&#39;ve revoked voting rights or reestablished slavery. <br/>
<br/>
***.But it might not be &quot;alright&quot; with another member of society, and in <br/>
that situation you have a conflict *** <br/>
<br/>
One way to avoid conflict is to think and act like everyone else.  <br/>
To never disagree when you think someone is wrong wouldn&#39;t necessarily avoid conflict because the &quot;wrong&quot; their doing may be causing conflict elsewhere.   To never stand up to oppressors wouldn&#39;t necessarily avoid conflict because the oppressed would still be suffering.   When is it right to be different or to speak out or to call for change or take action to make change?  <br/>
<br/>
Conflict is not always the worst thing that could happen.  In the case of spanking, conflict that would result (I&#39;m thinking court cases, some rantings in blogs, fundamentalist breakaway groups determined to forge their own little nations where the godly act of smacking kids is protected as a parent&#39;s right, maybe some especially busy and /or violent activism - the spankers march of ten thousand moms descending on DC and spanking their kids knowing they can&#39;t all be arrested)  Might not be worse than generations of kids growing up with violence inflicted upon them in their homes by their parents.  It might not be worse than continuing to think of children as the property of their parents.  It might not be worse than an acknowledgement of ones right to not be assaulted. <br/>
<br/>
The positive gains for some years of social unrest are sometimes worth the social unrest.   <br/>
<br/>
***when societal members have a <br/>
conflict the only way to solve the conflict is to acquiesce to <br/>
the &quot;might makes right&quot; mentality. ***<br/>
<br/>
I have a not so secret delight in violence.&lt;g&gt; I think violence is usually the most effective way to quickly solve a problem. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a long term solution, unless you kill *all* the other guys,  but it does seem to work in the moment.  I suspect lots of folks feel that way and that&#39;s why they smack their kids.  I reckon humans have a long history of that kind of problem solving and it won&#39;t be changed by changing our form of government.   <br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t see all societal conflict - in the way we usually see it when it occurs in America today - as necessarily worse than the thing we&#39;re conflicted over.   <br/>
The Civil Rights Movement was not a more harmful thing to society than the denial of the right to vote.  <br/>
I think if we made assaulting children illegal it would be worth the wrath of those who would oppose it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not defending schools and I would personally like to see an end to compulsory attendance laws.  But not addressing the problem of child abuse because we&#39;re afraid of conflict over homeschooling rights would be irresponsible and just pretty darn crappy.<br/>
<br/>
I think the original worry here was that California would suddenly become a place where parents couldn&#39;t homeschool their kids.   The court document said that there were several exemptions from the California law of compulsory attendance and this family had not sufficiently met any of those exemptions.   That there are hundreds (or thousands? I don&#39;t know) of families homeschooling in California suggests that many families successfully exempt their children and this parent could have too.   It seems a case where a person put his own religious or political agenda before the welfare of his children.  It&#39;s possible that no matter what kind of a nut he wanted to be he could have successfully exempted his kid and he didn&#39;t.   Abuse, if he was abusive, is not a homeschooling issue.   <br/>
<br/>
In this case, if the parent was abusive,  I don&#39;t think the power and authority of the parent over his kids was preferable to the state&#39;s power over the parent.  I think the unchecked power of parents over children is more dangerous than the power of a state over an individual because the state&#39;s power can be changed by voters (or an angry mob&lt;g&gt;) and an abusive parent&#39;s power can rarely be questioned or changed by a little kid. <br/>
<br/>
***That is the biggest issue I have <br/>
with society&#39;s authority, &quot;might makes right&quot; is the only direction <br/>
in which it can move.***<br/>
<br/>
How you might change it and what you might change it to will take special consideration if you hope to avoid conflict.  <br/>
 <br/>
***&quot;Humans are imperfect&quot; is nothing but propaganda, it is completely<br/>
untrue, I posit that nothing can be a more perfect human than a<br/>
human.***<br/>
<br/>
Humans are well suited to do what humans do.  That doesn&#39;t make us perfect.   We&#39;re not always perfect in our logic, in our decision making.  We&#39;re not always perfect parents.   In lots of ways we&#39;re inferior to many of our fellow Earthlings.   But we continue to learn even though there are long dark periods where not much good seems to develop and then we sometimes have a little renaissance.  <br/>

you&#39;re seeing the forest thru the trees. Putting the obviously biased <br/>
opinion article aside (it was obviously speaking to a certain <br/>
audience and looking for a cetain reaction), what the court case is <br/>
stating is disturbing, because it is NOT addressing the abuse <br/>
allegations so much as the homeschool rights. Now it&#39;s posible that <br/>
the abuse allegations are being treated as a seperate case, IDK. But <br/>
what is in this case is dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

umbrella school, which hundreds of others do as well. One of the <br/>
other options was to establish your own private school in your home, <br/>
but from the sounds of the court case, this was an unacceptable form <br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;That there are hundreds (or thousands? I don&#39;t know) of families <br/>

&gt;issue.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Precisely! It is *not* a homeschooling issue. It&#39;s an abuse issue. <br/>
And they never stated that they were requiring school because of the <br/>
abuse or until they clear up the allegations or whatever. They were <br/>
turning an abuse case into a homeschooling issue, thereby **setting a <br/>
precedent for future cases** (just as how this case used prior court <br/>
cases as a precedent to argue their point that HSing is not lawful).  <br/>
<br/>
So what happens if it comes out that this son and father simply had <br/>
an argument and the son called CPS with allegations that were not <br/>
true? If the abuse is overturned, the kids don&#39;t go back to <br/>
homeschooling because the court didn&#39;t state they had to go to school <br/>
because of abuse, but ***because of qualifications to homeschool***. <br/>
The court has turned allegations of abuse into a legal right to <br/>
homeschool or not homeschool. THAT&#39;S the issue.<br/>
<br/>
The very fist line of the document states: In this dependency case <br/>
(Welf. & Inst. Code, § 300), we consider the question whether parents <br/>
can legally &quot;home school&quot; their children. [Not whether these parents <br/>
but whether parents in general.]<br/>
<br/>
Subsequent lines state: &quot;However, California courts have held that <br/>
under provisions in the Education Code, parents ****do not have a <br/>
constitutional right to homeschool their chilredn***.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This document also states that the parents were <br/>
providing &quot;lousy,&quot; &quot;meager,&quot; and &quot;bad,&quot; education, and that keeping <br/>
the children at home &quot;deprived them of situations where (1) they<br/>
could interact with people outside the family, (2) there are people <br/>
who could provide help if something is amiss in the children&#39;s lives, <br/>
and (3) they could develop emotionally in a broader world than the <br/>
parents&#39; &quot;cloistered&quot; setting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How many judges could state the same about unschoolers, calling our <br/>
education &quot;lousy, meager or bad&quot;? We know it&#39;s not true but to an <br/>
outside opinion (like that of my BILs) that is what they see. So the <br/>
question is not whether their education is lousy but who&#39;s right is <br/>
it to state so? Isn&#39;t it your right to maintain your childrens <br/>
eduction and to state whether they are learning? What if the court <br/>
came into to your life and stated what you were doing didn&#39;t <br/>
constitute &quot;Education&quot; as they saw it and demanded your child/ren go <br/>
to public school?<br/>
<br/>
The document also clearly states they believe the rights of the state <br/>
are above the rights of the parents by stating <br/>
- &quot;primary purpose of the educational system is to train school <br/>
children in good citizenship, patriotism and loyalty to the state and <br/>
the nation as a means of **protecting the public welfare**&quot; <br/>
- &quot;that nothing be taught which is manifestly inimical to the public <br/>
welfare.&#39;&quot; - &quot;the power of the state to enforce compulsory education <br/>
of children within the state at some school is beyond question&quot;, <br/>
- &quot;the juvenile court has authority to<br/>
limit a parent&#39;s control over a dependent child, including a parent&#39;s <br/>
right to make educational decisions for a child&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The court here is stating that homeschooling in general is bad for <br/>
public welfare. They are stating they have the right to mandate what <br/>
is taught and not taught. So what if they decide that my views on <br/>
public school, religion, the war etc are &quot;manifestly inimical to the <br/>
public welfare&quot;? This gives the state the right ot mandate what our <br/>
views (i.e. thoughts, action, statements) are!<br/>
<br/>
If this were an abuse case and only about abuse, it would not have <br/>
stated all it did. It would have centered around the abuse. But they <br/>
are taking an abuse case and setting a precedent for public <br/>
education. The right to homeschool and alegations of abuse are two <br/>
seperate things. And when you treat them seperately, you can see <br/>
where the homeschool issue will take Californians. It is stepping <br/>
them in the direction of the state having power over the parents in <br/>
regards to education or anything else they see as being bad for <br/>
society. <br/>
<br/>
Where do you draw the line?<br/>

&gt; public school, religion, the war etc are &quot;manifestly inimical to the<br/>

from a different perspective -- still, TX is available :D (I say this<br/>
because in America, if we don&#39;t like the way things are run in any state, we<br/>
can change it, adapt to it, or live somewhere more suitable -- no one<br/>
(outside of the legal system) is forced to live in a state that doesn&#39;t fit<br/>

keeping the children at home &quot;deprived them of situations where<br/>
(1) they could interact with people outside the family,<br/>
(2) there are people who could provide help if something is amiss in <br/>
the children&#39;s lives, and<br/>
(3) they could develop emotionally in a broader world than the<br/>
parents&#39; &quot;cloistered&quot; setting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How many judges could state the same about unschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***I know lots of unschooling families IRL and I can&#39;t think of a single<br/>
family where these three criteria are not met.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But I know several HOMEschooling families in this situation.<br/>
<br/>
1) The children *never* go anywhere without at least one parent (and <br/>
usually the rest of the kids too).<br/>
2) The people who *could* provide help are in the same boat and <br/>
paddling in the same direction. They *could* help, but they won&#39;t.<br/>
3) And their world is only as broad as their church allows it to be.<br/>
<br/>
These people scare *me* too! And I am surrounded by them in SC, the <br/>
home of Bob Jones University.<br/>
<br/>
I have a {{{neighborhood}}} homeschooling support group---I mean, <br/>
*right* here! I was thrilled when I found that out when we first <br/>
started homeschooling!<br/>
<br/>
But they&#39;re not the crowd I felt good about hanging out with. They <br/>
wanted their children&#39;s lives to be as small as possible. Our <br/>
&quot;worldliness&quot; was not a good match with them. They were afraid of me <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
They had some darling and delightful children, who really didn&#39;t know <br/>
any different. And because their lives are so cloistered, unless they <br/>
leave the church---AND their families, they won&#39;t ever know anything <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
I can see how their thinking would concern Californians. It doesn&#39;t <br/>
much concern South Carolinians, who have voted in legislators with <br/>
similar values. *I* am more likely to get attacked for unschooling here <br/>
in South Carolina than they are for religiously homeschooling. I would <br/>
think my rights as an unschooling mom would be a bit stronger though in <br/>
progressive California.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to tell what the real story is regarding this article. <br/>
Homeschooling. Abuse. Whether they followed homeschool laws. Cloistered <br/>
lives. NEA. Older siblings. Christian. Lots of factors we really don&#39;t <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is a relative term and looks different in each household. <br/>
It&#39;s legal in all states.<br/>
<br/>
Abuse is a relative term---legally. Spanking is legal in all states   <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://kidjacked.com/legal/spanking_law.asp">http://kidjacked.com/legal/spanking_law.asp</a>   Even California.<br/>
<br/>
We can choose where to live. We can choose whether to follow the laws <br/>
of where we live. We can choose to fight the laws. And we can choose to <br/>
live with the consequences of our actions.<br/>

Of course, don&#39;t take that as a stopping point. Do your own research  <br/>
and find out what they&#39;re about.<br/>
<br/>
This story is very similar to the homeschooling &quot;alerts&quot; HSLDA sends  <br/>
out that are full of seemingly alarming reports of threats to  <br/>
homeschooling but end up going no where. They&#39;re just attempts by  <br/>
lawyers to find some route into court. They get thrown out by judges.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t that homeschooling in particular gets targeted. I suspect no  <br/>
matter what your concern, if you watched all the cases filed you&#39;d  <br/>
feel like your rights were on the verge of collapsing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-416210328">I believe my point was that ALL media is compromised and disreputable<br/>
by virtue of the fact that money is the only thing they care about.<br/>
Saying you haven&#39;t seen this reported by any reputable news source is<br/>
saying that WND is disreputable and there might be some news source<br/>
that isn&#39;t slanted one way or the other and chasing the almighty<br/>
dollar.  I suspect that if we dug into the founders of all the major<br/>
media there would be similar nasty stuff in their backgrounds.  In<br/>
other words, I&#39;m not defending WND as much as saying all media outlets<br/>
are smiliarly inclined they just lean in the other direction.<br/>
