<div id="ygrps-yiv-525057821">I have really been learning a lot by reading everyone&#39;s posts and I even<br/>
have saved some sites on my favorites to return to and order books as money<br/>
allows (I looked them up at library and they don&#39;t have them...).  Thank you<br/>
so much for being open to my ignorance :)  <br/>
 <br/>
I have to admit that I have never regretted more in my life than the last 11<br/>
years of parenting.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t regret being a parent at<br/>
all, just the way I have parented.  I am sure some of you kwim.  I know the<br/>
saying goes, we do the best we have with what we&#39;ve got and now that we know<br/>
better we can do better but still, how does one un-do 11 years and start<br/>
over?  I am not as self-less as some of the people I have seen post about<br/>
how they do sleep patterns or even adjust their days.  I am a person that<br/>
has to have some kind of order to the day, some kind of rhythm.  I have so<br/>
many things that need to get completed (or started) each day and of course I<br/>
need my sleep that to be random and uberflexible would be<br/>
counterproductive...add to that the many other dynamics of our household (I<br/>
started to list but it seems too long).  <br/>
 <br/>
Basically, my goal is to have a balance of everyone&#39;s (including parents)<br/>
needs/wants being met while guiding my children into respectful, responsible<br/>
adults one day.  I know some of it is a matter of letting go and trusting<br/>
which is something my dh and I have issues with that we are working on but<br/>
it is hard to reprogram 30+ years of &#39;habit&#39;  <br/>
 <br/>
Regarding my oldest:<br/>
As I asked, how do I re-do 11 years and start over?  how do I let go and<br/>
trust while there are still &#39;things&#39; Seth is responsible for doing each<br/>
day/week?  to be more specific on some &quot;things&quot;: Twice a day he is supposed<br/>
to feed the animals (1 dog and 1 cat) and give them fresh water.  Twice a<br/>
day he is supposed to brush his teeth.  Once a day he is supposed to take a<br/>
shower and clean himself. Since we are living with my FIL space is limited<br/>
and we have to put our &#39;office&#39; in Seth&#39;s room and since it is so very<br/>
small, the mess spills over into the office area and really gets to me so he<br/>
is supposed to tidy his room each day. Twice a week he is supposed to gather<br/>
the trash and take it out to the curb for pick-up.  So are we supposed to<br/>
just let him go and not require that he continue on with his regular<br/>
responsibilities and us do them instead?  If so how do we get him to bathe<br/>
and brush his teeth each day (a struggle at *all* times)...or do we just<br/>
deal with the stink of him not bathing and cost of dental work?  I do not<br/>
think it too much to ask for him to go to bed at a reasonable time so that<br/>
we as parents have some down time before going to bed ourselves...to me that<br/>
is part of the balance I am striving for.  So...how do I start, right now,<br/>
implementing this new way of life?  Do we sit down and talk about it?  Do we<br/>
just stop asking him to do things or reminding him to do the task and if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t do it, us just do it?  Do we just allow him to sit around and eat<br/>
all day even though we aren&#39;t the ones who buy a majority of the food?<br/>
 <br/>
Regarding my youngest:<br/>
Poor Aden (1) had a pretty rough start and nothing went as I planned except<br/>
having an amazing homebirth and being able to stay home with him.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>
able to breastfeed and while trying to get that started and/or figure out<br/>
why I couldn&#39;t we were spending so much time trying things that we didn&#39;t<br/>
get a chance to learn his cues of sleepy, hungry, etc.  So since I had to go<br/>
to bottle feeding anyway, we started feeding by the clock (he had to gain<br/>
weight fast) instead of on demand like I wanted.  Long story short, the<br/>
reason his sleeping has been an issue is that because he was hungry all the<br/>
time (and I didn&#39;t know it or we were trying different attachment<br/>
techniques) he cried all the time and didn&#39;t sleep very well.  With sign<br/>
language and kinda knowing how long it has been since he last ate, I am<br/>
learning when he wants to sleep.  My questions regarding this age and<br/>
starting the &#39;let go and trust&#39; thing is how do you establish respect for<br/>
others when the world centers around them?  How do you &quot;teach&quot; that they<br/>
will not always get what they want when they want it (toys, etc) and that it<br/>
is okay?  How do you get anything done (run errands, etc) when they can only<br/>
sleep in their beds, on you, etc?<br/>
 <br/>
Okay I think I have taken enough time right now.  I look forward to your<br/>
words of wisdom :)<br/>
 <br/>
In Gratitude,<br/>

You&#39;ve got to let that go. Dwelling in past hurts won&#39;t help you move forward NOW. Start right now to make better choices each and every day when it comes to parenting. Don&#39;t have regrets, make it better. Be the mom your kids deserve. Have the family you&#39;ve always wanted. :o)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;So are we supposed to just let him go and not require that he continue on with his regular responsibilities and us do them instead? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would start by not sweating the &quot;chores&quot; so much. Maybe do them together or pitch in when he&#39;s really not feeling like helping out. Say yes more often and nag less. See if he&#39;ll help you do other stuff instead. Not as a chore, but just notice when he offers to help bring in the groceries, or watch the little one while you shower, or clear off the table before dinner. Whatever it is. Take notice  of his participation in family rituals. Give him some space and see if you can build a relationship that&#39;s not built on you nagging and reminding him of what he should be doing. Notice what he is doing and build on that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If so how do we get him to bathe<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and brush his teeth each day (a struggle at *all* times)...or do we just<br/>
deal with the stink of him not bathing and cost of dental work?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know it seems logical that if a kid doesn&#39;t bathe they&#39;ll stink and if they don&#39;t brush twice a day they&#39;ll get many cavities. But is this really the truth? My kids are both in the hormonal changes of puberty and missing showers or baths still does not  result in them stinking. it has more to do with their hair getting oily and messy than anything else. Both have the choice to shower or not. Both have gone through non-showering times, but on the whole each prefers to be clean and presentable.<br/>
<br/>
And of course there are lots of ways to invite a child to shower or brush teeth without forcing it. Fun toothpaste, a new electric toothbrush, foaming bath gel, etc. have all worked around here. And my kids have had 4 cavities total between the two of them. It didn&#39;t seem to be connected to their teeth brushing habits at all either. Each of the  just seemed to get a cavity or 2 as puberty started.<br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>

rather than letting him know you noticed he&#39;s helping. The first will  <br/>
let him know he&#39;s valued. The second sends a message that he&#39;s  <br/>
finally doing what you&#39;d like him to do -- and the result is he may  <br/>
back off.<br/>
<br/>
Say &quot;Thank you. That helped me out a lot,&quot; rather than &quot;I noticed  <br/>
that you did such and such. Thank you.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I read through the whole list of expectations and frankly it made me  <br/>
exhausted! Both for him and for you. For him not because the list is  <br/>
so difficult but because it&#39;s someone else&#39;s expectations of what he  <br/>
should be doing with his time. For you because you need to keep on  <br/>
top of him to make sure he does it. I know if I&#39;ve delegated parts of  <br/>
some task to my daughter to do sometime during the day, ideally I  <br/>
want to hand it over so I can mentally check it off my list. In  <br/>
reality it expands so that the item pops up every half hour or so as  <br/>
I check to see if I can get it off my list or not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say do it yourself. Invite him along. Ask if he&#39;d like to keep  <br/>
you company so you can talk about stuff while you do something. But  <br/>
honestly I wouldn&#39;t expect him to jump up and start pitching in. He  <br/>
needs to time to be free of being told what to do before he can feel  <br/>
free to lend a hand because he wants to. Right now if he hears an  <br/>
honest question like &quot;Would you mind doing x?&quot; where his answer of no  <br/>
is as acceptable as yes, he&#39;s not going to hear it as a question but  <br/>
as a supposedly polite way of saying: &quot;Do x.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s lots of collected questions and answers about chores at my  <br/>
website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>
<br/>
&gt; My questions regarding this age and<br/>
&gt; starting the &#39;let go and trust&#39; thing is how do you establish  <br/>
&gt; respect for<br/>
&gt; others when the world centers around them?  How do you &quot;teach&quot; that  <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; will not always get what they want when they want it (toys, etc)  <br/>
&gt; and that it<br/>
&gt; is okay?  How do you get anything done (run errands, etc) when they  <br/>
&gt; can only<br/>
&gt; sleep in their beds, on you, etc?<br/>
<br/>
I think I would stop focusing on why you think he&#39;s so demanding. It  <br/>
could very well be it&#39;s an inherent part of his personality and he  <br/>
would have been that way even if he&#39;d breastfed.<br/>
<br/>
So instead of focusing on changing him, focus on helping him. (That  <br/>
may not make sense now, but it will later.) He needs to know your his  <br/>
partner in his dealing with the world. Calmly accept that he may feel  <br/>
needs stronger than other kids and help him be happy. (He won&#39;t be  <br/>
happy always. But  helping figure out pathways to help himself get to  <br/>
happiness. Again, that probably won&#39;t make sense yet!)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s too young for you to expect him to see the needs of others as  <br/>
more important than his. He will learn because he&#39;ll mature and his  <br/>
needs will change and because all of life won&#39;t respond to him  <br/>
immediately.<br/>
<br/>
To get there, when you can&#39;t respond immediately -- like if you&#39;re  <br/>
going to the bathroom! -- be honest that you can&#39;t get there right  <br/>
away but then *do* respond as soon as you can. Help him build a sense  <br/>
of trust that his needs are at the top of your priority list and that  <br/>
you will help him as soon as humanly possible.<br/>
<br/>
I know I sometimes get into a mode where it seems like it&#39;s my job to  <br/>
do everything and why can&#39;t my daughter understand that she shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
be dumping another thing on top of a burden that&#39;s already too  large  <br/>
and I get frustrated with her. Don&#39;t do that ;-) Accept that  <br/>
sometimes things pile up and all we can do is tackle things as best  <br/>
we can. Be honest that you&#39;ll be there when you can *and then be  <br/>
there when you can*.<br/>
