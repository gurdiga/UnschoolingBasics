<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017795536">I&#39;ve been doing a little much needed reading here on the list.  For <br/>
those of you that don&#39;t know me, my name is Tina.  Adrian, 11 next <br/>
month, and I have been unschooling for the past year.  Before that <br/>
he did school at home and before that public school.  It&#39;s been an <br/>
interesting journey to this point.<br/>
<br/>
Life has gotten complicated for us.  He suffered a trauma this past <br/>
summer.  I believe (know) he is depressed.  On top of everything my <br/>
dad is dying of male breast cancer.  I am his only biological child <br/>
and his primary care giver.  This takes up a tremendous amount of my <br/>
time.  I managed to get Mondays &quot;free&quot; from going to my dad&#39;s, and <br/>
Thursdays I only have to go at night.  So, I make it a point to be <br/>
as available as possible on those days.  The other, more hectic, <br/>
days I make myself available as much as possible.  With demands of <br/>
children in public school, my &quot;fiance&#39;&quot;, six other children, two of <br/>
them continuing their education beginning this week, things are just <br/>
crazy.  Oh, and I just found out that I&#39;m going to be a grandma this <br/>
year at the ripe old age of 34!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, given the above information, I tend to get a case of the <br/>
guilts and second guessing how well I&#39;m doing what I &quot;do&quot; with my <br/>
unschooled son.  Are there any of you out there that have words of <br/>
wisdom to share?  I try to take comfort in knowing that he&#39;s totally <br/>
into PS2, Adult Swim, Fresh Prince, movies, etc.  These are all <br/>
solitary things that keep him alone in his room most of the time.  I <br/>
know it&#39;s okay, but I do worry sometimes.  Yes, I do join him in his <br/>
room to watch movies, check out his hamsters, prepare for his <br/>
leopard gecko or just watch him play GTA San Andreas.  <br/>
<br/>
These are the things that I wonder:  <br/>
<br/>
Is there ever a time when it&#39;s not &quot;normal&quot; anymore?  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s going to counseling in regard to his trauma and depression <br/>
beginning February 3rd.  What should I be concerned about in <br/>
relation to unschooling and this situation?<br/>
<br/>
Is there something that I should be doing more of given that I&#39;m so <br/>
pre-occupied with caring for my father?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not been restricting his viewing or game playing, and I&#39;m okay <br/>
with that.  BUT, what about the colorful vocabulary he&#39;s learned at <br/>
such a young age and his rather synical attitude?  <br/>
<br/>
What about friends?  Is it okay that he doesn&#39;t have a single one?  <br/>
He doesn&#39;t really do or participate in anything so there&#39;s no <br/>
opportunity to meet anyone and form relationships?  Does it really <br/>
matter?  He is, I believe, highly sensitive.  It fits his <br/>
personality to not like crowds and things like parties.  When should <br/>
I be concerned?  Should I ever?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope someone out there can make sense of my ramblings.  <br/>
It&#39;s just a VERY tough time right now, and without being around <br/>
experienced unschoolers and others living this lifestyle, heck Pat <br/>
doesn&#39;t even know what I&#39;m doing, it can be a bit daunting at <br/>
times.  Normally, I try to read a lot, but time is just not <br/>
available for that right now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your insight...<br/>

<br/>
Of course there is but it is a different place for everyone and it is different at different times in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
If your son is depressed, he may well be &quot;self-medicating&quot; and to be honest, I see that as a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
I would put everything you are worried about on the back burner until you get a handle on the depression and then see what is happening.<br/>
