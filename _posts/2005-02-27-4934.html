<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540749">Hello all homeschooling Moms and Dads! I am just advertising myself. <br/>
I work as an Indenpendent Beauty Consultant for Mary Kay. I love my <br/>
job because I get to work from home, but because I am just starting <br/>
out (3 months) I can always use more customers! Not only do we just <br/>
sell great products we also offer parties. There are many types but <br/>
the most common is the facial party. You get to try all of our great <br/>
skin care products right in you own home. And its all for free. For <br/>
hosting a party you recieve a free gift and earn free products. The <br/>
way you earn free products is by the total you sell at the party is <br/>
the way I base the amonut. Just recentally at a party with only four <br/>
women the hostess earned $40.00 in free products. She earned an <br/>
additional $20.00 from outside orders from here work. We have <br/>
wonderful products that really work. I know I use them everyday. So <br/>
does my whole family now. Please e-mail me if you would like to host <br/>
a party or just have any questions. I do individual consults too. You <br/>
can try dozens of samples and its all free. The only you pay for is <br/>
the products if any you choose to buy. And just because you all have <br/>
helped me so much in homeschooling my daughter you can all recieve <br/>
10% off anything and everything you order. Please tell anyone you <br/>
know too. Its a real big help. Its so hard to get my name out there <br/>
but hopefully this will help. Thanks so much for your time<br/>

This list is not designed for advertising your business. This is a <br/>
list for discussing unschooling. I&#39;m sorry that got through <br/>
everyone....back to your regular unschooling discussion.<br/>
