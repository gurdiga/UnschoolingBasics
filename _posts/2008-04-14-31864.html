<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106962155">I just have to pass along this show on the Sundance Channel.  It is <br/>
called Iconoclasts, and it features an American Icon with another type <br/>
of American Icon, together in quiet conversation.  <br/>
<br/>
The one I saw was Maya Angelou and Dave Chappelle (comedian).  Maya <br/>
was so amazing, tears streamed down my face the entire hour.  I <br/>
realized how much our children learn from the adults around them, and <br/>
how perhaps bringing more awareness into our home about these amazing <br/>
gems is what I need to do!  Our elders, and I mean OUR elders are <br/>
veritable warehouses of knowledge and stories.  And from those stories <br/>
the world is alive!<br/>
<br/>
Here you can see the line up.<br/>
