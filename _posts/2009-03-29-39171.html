<div id="ygrps-yiv-482069619">How high/steep is the roof?<br/>
Has he seen anyone do roofing work?<br/>
Can you get up with him and walk around?<br/>
<br/>
We used to live in an earth sheltered house, so roof was low to the ground at the back, 3yo ds got up and jumped off the back gable, 8ft and broke three metatarsal bones. I wish he had asked me about playing on the roof first, I would have come out and helped him play on it, but realise the jump was a bit too high!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-477722524">Well, it&#39;s kind of a hot button between my dh and I.  Her 10 y0. sister has a window leading out to a small pc. of roof that is low.  And her sister won&#39;t let her on this.  So, I said she could go on the roof of the front porch, which is attached to the rest of the roof (there are several different levels.  The highest area is the flattest.  But it is a 2-story house in parts).  So, she started there, but kept going up as high as she could go (she loves high places, I actually built an indoor tree house in our home because she kept climbing on the beams).  I told her that it was serious and that she couldn&#39;t run or go near the edge and had to be careful (things that I rarely say to her).  Now she wants to go up all the time and we do have a good friend who fell off a roof and is in a wheelchair, so it is a very present possibility to us.<br/>

My dh disagrees with it completely (he even wants to take down the tree house on occassion).  So, I struggle.  Am I allowing my kids so much freedom that I am putting their lives or health at stake?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-329731430">Linnaea must have been about 6 and Simon when they used to climb on the garage and the shed and the summer house roofs. They would jump off as well. I never climbed on the house roof as the roof tiles were too fragile to take playing on, but there was a flat roof above the sunroom that they could climb on. In the house we rent now there are no roofs that they could climb on. Maybe the next house will be more roof friendly. Is the roof accessible? Can you get on the roof too? Can you find other roofs to go on? Sometimes at parks they have little summer house things that have a roof that could be climbed on? Do you have friends with lower roofs who don&#39;t mind having your family climbing about on them?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421608727">I understand this fear. We have a friend (15) who is paraplegic after being<br/>
hit while seat belted in a car. He was 6. We all still ride in a car. We all<br/>
still seat belt in. Plenty of people don&#39;t fall, especially once they know<br/>
safety rules and follow them. I just wanted to put some perspective on your<br/>
fear.<br/>
<br/>
I figure that if this does happen to one of my children then that is there<br/>
life. I would surely do what I can to make it the best life possible for<br/>
them.<br/>

I had a high school teacher who was killed when he fell off a roof, and I have another friend who was left a quadriplegic after he fell off a roof.<br/>

For my dd, we enrolled her in gymnastics, and working on the high beam and the bars helped her satisfy her desire to be up high, but she learned how to do it (reasonably) safely, and she also heard from people other than her parents about the dangers of falling from a high point.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing you may try is to see if there is a gym or facility near you that has a rock-climbing wall.  Again, she will learn how to climb safely, and will have safety gear that will keep her from hitting the ground if she loses her grip.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679016815">I have to agree with this.  Although I feel that as a supportive parent it is a great honor to be able to honor our children&#39;s wishes, a five-year old is not that capable of understanding the severity of their actions if they fall.  While we can talk about falling, going to the hospital, becoming parapelegic, dying, etc none of these REALLY have the impact of understanding that we as adults understand it.  I believe there are many other ways to satisfy this desire to climb (I have an outrageous climber who wants to jump from our loft onto the couch at 3 yo - NO FEAR), I do not believe that THIS activity of climbing on the roof is an age-appropriate one. I wouldn&#39;t let my 5 yo jump off trains if he was interested and climbing on the roof can be every bit as dangerous, especially since it seems more innocent and can lead to the belief that everything is ok and then - SLIP - one second later you have a terrible situation on your hand.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I also would not think to ask another neighbor about climbing on their rooftop, even if it were flat.  Unless you have a familial-type relationship with another family, they would probably worry about being sued if the child fell.  <br/>

&gt; and I have another friend who was left a quadriplegic after he fell  <br/>
&gt; off a roof.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On an unschooling list, it doesn&#39;t help to spread fear.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I understand the &quot;climbing&quot; thing - I have a dd who is a climber,  <br/>
&gt; but I am the parent, and I am responsible for drawing the line at  <br/>
&gt; activities that I feel will endanger her.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;But I am the parent&quot; has been used (somewhat like the &quot;I know my  <br/>
children best&quot; statement) as an excuse to foist all manner of  <br/>
restrictions on children. Sometimes for no other reason than the fears  <br/>
of the parents.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; For my dd, we enrolled her in gymnastics, and working on the high  <br/>
&gt; beam and the bars helped her satisfy her desire to be up high, but  <br/>
&gt; she learned how to do it (reasonably) safely, and she also heard  <br/>
&gt; from people other than her parents about the dangers of falling from  <br/>
&gt; a high point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So you helped to reinforce fear by making sure she heard it from  <br/>
others, besides yourselves? What about helping her understand not only  <br/>
the risks but why you feel the way you do?<br/>
<br/>
How about imagining with her what it would be like to go up on a roof  <br/>
(without any warnings)? She could talk about what she&#39;d sees, what it  <br/>
would smell like, where she&#39;d place her hands and feel, how powerful  <br/>
she&#39;d feel? You could learn more about her that way.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you should watch the documentary &quot;Man on Wire&quot; to understand why  <br/>
some people have no fear about being up high and what their  <br/>
motivations are &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Another thing you may try is to see if there is a gym or facility  <br/>
&gt; near you that has a rock-climbing wall.  Again, she will learn how  <br/>
&gt; to climb safely, and will have safety gear that will keep her from  <br/>
&gt; hitting the ground if she loses her grip.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a bad idea. Providing other opportunities to be up high is  <br/>
definitely a way to help a child with what she wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
Injecting fear into the process doesn&#39;t help, though.<br/>
<br/>
Tell us more about you and your family and how long you&#39;ve been  <br/>
unschooling. Maybe that will put this post in context.<br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s always &quot;injecting fear&quot; to talk through potential outcomes with children. That is part of the inexperience of youth and I do think it can be helpful to verbally walk through potential outcomes in a situation where there is greater risk. Heck, even situations where there isn&#39;t a lot of risk that can be a useful tool.<br/>
<br/>
Not to create fear, but awareness.<br/>

outcomes can be dangerous. I was thinking one could probably do that  <br/>
without a fear-based bias.<br/>

Well yeah, saying &quot;I am really concerned about x,y,z&quot; is different than &quot;I know a guy who is a paraplegic....&quot; blah, blah, blah.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone can come up with a horrific story about someone who was injured or died in some bizarre, risky way. But then, people shouldn&#39;t get on horses or in cars or fly on airplanes or go hiking/camping or any other number of things that have potential for death/injury!<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Course being alive is pretty risky.;)<br/>
<br/>
I would personally have huge issues with any kid wanting to be on our roof. I&#39;d be finding another roof or another outlet for that fascination because ours is definitely not safe on the best day. Unschooling is about creative problem solving not just ignoring my safety instincts as a Mum. &quot;No&quot; happens.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145056456">My one absolute rule is (whether they wish to go on the roof, or play with matches, or whatever,) they need an adult with them at arms length at all times.<br/>
Usually, it&#39;s me, because most adults don&#39;t understand why I would let my child &quot;play&quot; with matches or allow them on the roof!  Yes, it takes time and energy from me, but I&#39;m happy to turn it into a learning experience.<br/>
We set up the safety provisions, such as having the fire extinguisher and a bucket of water close by, and cover the science principles such as why blowing out the flame can incite it more, etc.  They learn quite a bit about safety, science and the answers to all their questions.<br/>
As a child, I set fire to kleenix in the bathtub while the babysitters talked on the phone, because I was not allowed to touch fire. I wouldn&#39;t dare do it while my parents were around.  My husband set his bedroom carpet on fire.  Kids are going to do it.  Regardless.  May as well teach them to do it safely and supervised.<br/>
