<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571195540">Kristen, Have you ever gone to a La Leche League Meeting in your area? Maybe it will help you connect with other moms that breastfeed and your dd will be able to see other babies and toddlers nursing. As I posted before I still breastfeed my 4 and a half years old ds and my 11 month old dd. My ds only nurses one a day ( up to three times).I have never had any problems nursing in public and I nurse everywhere. Myabe is my attitude but I have only gotten compliments on it. My ds does not nurse in public anymore. But if he ever asks for it I will nurse him ( because if he does he really needs it).<br/>
A great website on nursing that has great tips on nursing in public is<br/>
