<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221684200">Hello everyone! Forgive me for not introducing myself sooner...<br/>
<br/>
My name is Deborah and I live in Daytona Beach. I have 2 boys, ages<br/>
8 and 11. Although I have been homeschooling them from the<br/>
beginning, they just aren&#39;t very cooperative - don&#39;t like<br/>
the &quot;school&quot; atmosphere. So, to try something new, we devoted this<br/>
year to unschooling - boy - what a difference in attitudes! Now,<br/>
they actually want to pick up a book or play with their &quot;dreaded&quot;<br/>
LeapPad books, etc. I find them watching Animal Planet quite a bit<br/>
nowdays, which is quite amusing, as it was one of the &quot;schooly&quot;<br/>
channels before! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Now for my problem...at the end of this month, their evaluation is<br/>
scheduled. There is a local group in town who does the evaluations<br/>
for all the homeschoolers. (Volusia County requires all<br/>
homeschooled children to be evaluated by certified teachers and that<br/>
evaluation be sent to the school board). Anyway, this being my<br/>
first unschooling year, I have nothing prepared. We are supposed to<br/>
bring a folder with &quot;sample&quot; work performed by each child. The<br/>
teacher/evaluator then goes through the notebook/file and makes sure<br/>
that all is OK. We are then given a certificate to copy and mail to<br/>
the school board. I&#39;m not sure exactly what to bring. I&#39;m pretty<br/>
nervous about the reaction, as I don&#39;t believe any of these moms are<br/>
doing the unschooling thing. I am not sure what the reaction will<br/>
be. I have heard about Alternative Institute, Inc. and that by<br/>
signing up with them, you can bypass the &quot;requirements&quot; of the<br/>
school board, which would be really nice. But, I don&#39;t know enough<br/>
about it. If anyone could steer me in the right direction, I would<br/>
greatly appreciate it! Also, if someone could give me some idea of<br/>
what I can take in to show as &quot;schoolwork&quot; for this year, that would<br/>
also be wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much! Am hoping to learn a lot here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-706004332">I signed up with Florida Unschoolers so I didn&#39;t have to go through the evaluation process.  But I also keep a scrapbook of everything we do (everyday life, whatever we take pictures of.)  Do you have photos of anything you&#39;ve done this year, have they written or drawn anything?  Type up a book list of things they have read throughout the year.<br/>

<br/>
We had this issue at our house too.  First, I explained to my daughter that even the kids in ps don&#39;t learn all the same things at the same time.  Each state, each district, each school, even each teacher is different.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I pointed out some things they know that ps kids probably didn&#39;t know, such as how to make cheese, the types of dairy goats, etc..  Then I suggested that when someone quizzes her about stuff she doesn&#39;t know, she quiz them back.<br/>
<br/>
Then I pointed out that she can learn anything she wants, whenever she wants and I will gladly help her but that learning things is her responsibility, not mine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-633510778">Rod,<br/>
one thing that happens here is talking about our unschooling and life learning &#39;educational&#39; philosophy so that my kids recognize that it is not necessary to know what everyone else knows at the same time.  They are well armed when outsiders attempt to compare and contrast.  It doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t notice what other schooled kids their own age are learning.  But a.  they do recognize that even schooled kids don&#39;t always &#39;know&#39; what is being taught and b. each persons unique brilliance is reinforced so that they are aware not only of their own special gifts but that each person has unique gifts and specialties of interest and thus unique set of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
As for teasing by others, well that in itself is a great opportunity for discussion.  <br/>
If it happened here where my dd was embarrassed by not knowing something I might ask my dd if she is interested in learning the subject?  Is it important for her to &quot;keep up with&quot; kids in school?  How important is it to her to learn it now?  Does she want to learn they way kids her age are taught in school?  Or how would she like to go about learning what kids in school are taught?  We&#39;ve had similar discussions about some subjects and the result was her dedication to learning a tool now or not.  <br/>
<br/>
The other thing that might be pointed out is that your son may already know fractions but not in terms of the way it looks in school.  It may not be about comparing apples and oranges, but fuji vs granny smith vs pink ladies.  They are all apples.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192664278">My kids found out a curious thing when other kids were quizzing them (usually <br/>
in the 8 to 12 age range this has been a problem). Often the kids doing the <br/>
quizzing don&#39;t know the answer either. <br/>
<br/>
My son didn&#39;t get the point of the quizzing - when someone would ask him <br/>
something he didn&#39;t know, he&#39;d say &quot;No, I don&#39;t. What *IS* 1/4 of 20?&quot; or whatever <br/>
the question had been. Quite often the other kid would sputter something <br/>
about just wanting to know if they could figure it out. Or Patrick would start <br/>
talking to himself trying to figure the problem out, which usually baffled the <br/>
school kid - we&#39;ve noticed lots of kids think of math as something you know or <br/>
don&#39;t know, not as ideas to think about or problems to be solved, which is how <br/>
Patrick thinks.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the questions were along the lines of &quot;Have you learned fractions <br/>
yet?&quot; and Pat would answer yes or no and then ask something about what the <br/>
other kid knew about fractions, what was interesting about them, etc. He wanted to <br/>
know if it was something worth learning or not. <br/>
<br/>
They were interesting interactions to watch, because the two kids really <br/>
weren&#39;t having the same conversation. It was almost as if they were speaking <br/>
different languages.<br/>
