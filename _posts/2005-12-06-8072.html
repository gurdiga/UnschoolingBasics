<div id="ygrps-yiv-543332799">Just a quick question since there&#39;s a few dog groomers here... We have a 9  <br/>
1/2 week old mini-Dachshund pup... is there a safe shampoo I can use on her? <br/>
She  decided to take a roll around outside and managed to roll in some <br/>
doggy-doo. We  wiped her off, but she still has some odor on her from it.<br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;s such a cutie and the kids are loving her! Thanks in advance!  <br/>

 Oatmeal-based shampoos are great. Francodex makes one that seems to be available at all the pet stores I go into. Especially on such tender skin, avoid human shampoos---just a gentle dog shampoo for your new baby!<br/>
 <br/>
Congratulations on your new family member!<br/>
 <br/>
I just sent mine back to school last week. :-(<br/>

I will look for some, thanks!<br/>
 <br/>
Isabelle came into our life rather quickly.. lol. Our close friends have a  <br/>
mini-Dach, and are friends with the breeder. Zoe is a wonderful dog, we went  <br/>
camping with her this past summer. The breeder had another litter ready to go,  <br/>
Zoe&#39;s 1/2 siblings. So, they got another one and told us there were some <br/>
left.  We went and looked and ended up getting this cute little double-dappled <br/>
long  haired girl. So, since our friends live only about 2 mins away and we see <br/>
them a  lot, all 3 girls will be together often. The breeder was thrilled to <br/>
know that.  We&#39;ll do puppy classes together, and my son has assumed <br/>
responsibility of  Isabelle, which is really wonderful. I&#39;m impressed by his actions.  <br/>

 <br/>
Yes. His training can take anywhere from five to twelve months. We&#39;ll get monthly up-dates. Unfortunately, we get only ten days&#39; notice of graduation! We have a VERY, VERY busy &#39;06 coming up! We&#39;ll drop just about everything to make it to graduation (except the conference! &lt;G&gt;). But yes, we&#39;ll get to cry once more at graduation when we meet his new partner. <br/>
 <br/>
It will be VERY emotional.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for the cyber-hugs. It&#39;s been a rough couple of weeks.<br/>
