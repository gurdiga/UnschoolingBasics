Tell  me why I NEED to shut it off and not pick this silly  battle.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Do you need to shut them off?  Our family room lights get left on  all the <br/>
time, it is in our basement.  That doesn&#39;t mean that I want to go  down all the <br/>
time and shut them off, LOL.  I don&#39;t usually try to find out  who left them <br/>
on either, LOL.  Not that important who did it.  What I  usually do is just try <br/>
to remember that the next time I go down there for  something to turn them <br/>
off , or I will mention to everyone within earshot, that  whoever goes down next <br/>
to try to remember to turn them off on the way up the  stairs.  Usually one <br/>
of us will be going down there for something in the  next 15 minutes.  I just <br/>
don&#39;t see the lights in the basement as that much  of a priority.  It is just <br/>
as likely that it was me that left them on as  anyone else.  I know my youngest <br/>
doesn&#39;t like to have the dark room behind  him while he is coming up the <br/>
stairs so he will leave them on.  To me that  sounds reasonable, I would do the <br/>
same in his situation.  <br/>
 <br/>
Not trying to suggest that the posts so far are in any  way &quot;off the mark&quot; <br/>
just that I see another option.  Not turning them  off.  Instead of who turns <br/>
them off, or at least not right this minute. <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe look for different solutions in those situations.  Instead of  the <br/>
first one that pops to mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884120246">There is a room near our bathroom that barely qualifies as a room. It <br/>
has a piano in it and all of my husband&#39;s clothes and shoes. When he <br/>
comes home from work he changes out of his work clothes in there, but <br/>
he goes in and out of there at other times for other reasons. He often <br/>
leaves the light on. I notice it fairly quickly because I&#39;m always <br/>
going in and out of the laundry room or the bathroom and you can see <br/>
the &quot;piano room&quot; from both. So I&#39;ll just yell toward the living room, <br/>
&quot;Are you done in the piano room?&quot; Because why turn it off if he&#39;s going <br/>
back in a minute? And he&#39;ll yell back that he&#39;s done and I&#39;ll turn it <br/>
off. No big deal. He gets a subtle non-blamey reminder that he left it <br/>
on, and I get to save a few hundredths of a penny on electricity, lol.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d hate it if our roles were reversed and DH was harping on me all the <br/>
time for wasting electricity, so when I feel myself starting to slip in <br/>
to lecture mode about it I bite my tongue. I think it&#39;s a good way to <br/>
model to Charlotte, a) we speak respectfully to each other even when <br/>
the other person is a bit forgetful or wasteful and b) it&#39;s good to <br/>
turn things off when you&#39;re not using them.<br/>

Yeah--- I was thinking maybe a separate connecting switch at the top of <br/>
the stairs would be a good idea! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>
They go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153309989">Anonymous at poster&#39;s request:<br/>
Thank you all so much for your very insightful and helpful replies! You are<br/>
all right and I will keep those things in mind the next time such issues<br/>
come up (like the clothes all over the floor of his room ;) )<br/>
Hearing your suggestions reminded me of something my father used to do in<br/>
our house. If you left your shoes out, he&#39;d throw them outside. One time, it<br/>
was so bad, I couldn&#39;t find my shoes for work and I was going to be late.<br/>
They were over the fence in the overgrowth, complete with bugs and wet from<br/>
rain. I was 17 y/o.<br/>
My husband was just muttering about me leaving my shoes out the other day.<br/>
Guess my Dad&#39;s tactic didn&#39;t work... ;-) Definate food for thought when I<br/>
fall into the same pattern. Thanks all</div>
