Home-schooling in the modern world: Worries about the long-term impact on<br/>
public education<br/>
<br/>
By Diane Glass<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s the problem with looking at short-term studies on home-schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Positive scholastic outcome of a sample of home-schooled children isn&#39;t the<br/>
only issue.<br/>
<br/>
You have to think about the long-term effects of what this trend means for<br/>
the future of education and the segregation of our school system over<br/>
ideology.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A paper presented at the American Educational Research Association in 1991<br/>
reported that there were generally two kinds of parents who choose<br/>
home-schooling for their children: the extremely religious and the &quot;New<br/>
Age.&quot; Both choose home-schooling for ideological reasons. Home-schooling is<br/>
not about how public schools teach so much as what they teach. Parents who<br/>
choose home-schooling want to instill in their children their own deeply<br/>
held beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Most of these parents are willing to take on traditional roles of male<br/>
breadwinner and female caretaker to accomplish this end. It makes you wonder<br/>
if the intensity of this commitment isn&#39;t so much about a good education as<br/>
it is about political inculcation. One benefit of a secular education is its<br/>
exposure to diverse views. This is something home-schooling may not offer if<br/>
a parent considers secular exposure a detriment.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the question of a parent&#39;s aptitude. Parents may have the right<br/>
to control their child&#39;s education, but do they have the right to practice<br/>
an occupation without any skill? If parents, or the recent trend of the<br/>
home-school neighborhood group, lack the range to leap from studying<br/>
geometry to English literature, a child will miss out on a topic that could<br/>
have proved valuable to her future. I know from experience that a teacher&#39;s<br/>
passion for a topic is just as important as the topic itself. That passion<br/>
is more often found in teachers who pursue this as a career.<br/>
<br/>
We also have to consider what this means for the future of public education.<br/>
University of Illinois professor Chris Lubienski contends that<br/>
home-schooling is not only a response to deteriorating public schools, but a<br/>
cause of its decline. Schools should be given the chance to respond to<br/>
public needs, he argues. Home-schooling doesn&#39;t help the public good, just<br/>
the individual. And our future is about all children, not just our own.<br/>

spent yesterday boiling down the turkey carcass to make soup) while <br/>
I&#39;m at work, would get a kick out of this. We often joke about how <br/>
he&#39;d look in a denim jumper lol. I think a truer statement might be <br/>
that homeschooling parents (of any philosophy) are willing to make <br/>
what sacrifices might be necessary to live on one income so that one <br/>
parent can be available to care for the child(ren). Although that <br/>
leaves out those who have two careers and put a lot of effort into <br/>
juggling their time so that someone is with the kids (working shifts, <br/>
job sharing, work from home, etc).<br/>

  <br/>
  Ah, so it&#39;s not about the individual and his/her right to an individual  idealogy -- it&#39;s about forcing integration of all individuals into the  prevailing ideology of society, and of course how it can further the  huge business generated by compulsive schooling. <br/>

  She couldn&#39;t find a more recent study to bolster her case -- or maybe a  newer study would indicate that it&#39;s not just fundies and new-agers who  homeschool.  <br/>

  Huh? Is she implying that all parents in traditional roles hold the same political beliefs?  <br/>
  <br/>
  ******<br/>
  <br/>
  One benefit of a secular education is its exposure to diverse views.  This is something home-schooling may not offer if a parent considers  secular exposure a detriment.<br/>
  <br/>
  *******<br/>
  <br/>
  First, this assumes that a home education is not secular.  Second,  one of the things public (I&#39;m guessing this is what she meant by  secular) does best is to crush all hope for true diversity.  <br/>
  <br/>
  ******<br/>
  <br/>
I know from experience that a teacher&#39;s passion for a topic is just  as important as the topic itself. That passion is more often found in  teachers who pursue this as a career.<br/>
  <br/>
  *****<br/>
  <br/>
  In 13 years of public school, I remember only two teachers whose  passion passion for a topic encouraged in me a lifelong love of  something.  I remember many more teachers who managed to suck all  the joy out of not only the topic they taught, but any room they  occupied.  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since finishing school, I&#39;ve met many more people in real life who  did/do more for my passions than I found in school.  I lost years  to pursue interests because my school experiences had left me feeling  inadequate to some topics.  <br/>
  <br/>
  *****<br/>
  <br/>
We also have to consider what this means for the future of public  education. University of Illinois professor Chris Lubienski contends  that home-schooling is not only a response to deteriorating public  schools, but a<br/>
  cause of its decline. Schools should be given the chance to respond to public needs, he argues.<br/>
  <br/>
  *******<br/>
  <br/>
  Ah, now we get to the real point of her argument -- protecting the  public school system, even if it means holding children hostage to  failing practices.  <br/>
  <br/>
  ******<br/>
  <br/>
  Home-schooling doesn&#39;t help the public good, just<br/>
  the individual. And our future is about all children, not just our own.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  <br/>
  Yeah, well I don&#39;t have the resources to save all children.   Neither am I willing to sacrifice my children to further someone else&#39;s  interpretation of the public good.<br/>

I know from experience that a teacher&#39;s passion for a topic is just  as important as the topic itself. That passion is more often found in  teachers who pursue this as a career.<br/>
  <br/>
  *****<br/>
  <br/>
  In 13 years of public school, I remember only two teachers whose  passion passion for a topic encouraged in me a lifelong love of  something.  I remember many more teachers who managed to suck all  the joy out of not only the topic they taught, but any room they  occupied.  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since finishing school, I&#39;ve met many more people in real life who  did/do more for my passions than I found in school.  I lost years  to pursue interests because my school experiences had left me feeling  inadequate to some topics.  <br/>
  <br/>
  *****<br/>
  <br/>
We also have to consider what this means for the future of public  education. University of Illinois professor Chris Lubienski contends  that home-schooling is not only a response to deteriorating public  schools, but a<br/>
  cause of its decline. Schools should be given the chance to respond to public needs, he argues.<br/>
  <br/>
  *******<br/>
  <br/>
  Ah, now we get to the real point of her argument -- protecting the  public school system, even if it means holding children hostage to  failing practices.  <br/>
  <br/>
  ******<br/>
  <br/>
  Home-schooling doesn&#39;t help the public good, just<br/>
  the individual. And our future is about all children, not just our own.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  <br/>
  Yeah, well I don&#39;t have the resources to save all children.   Neither am I willing to sacrifice my children to further someone else&#39;s  interpretation of the public good.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
LOL!  This is what I&#39;ve wanted to point out to my mom - about me!  She went<br/>
on a rant last week on the phone, for about 20 minutes, about how I&#39;m<br/>
ruining my son (he&#39;s 10) by not &#39;schooling&#39; him & how he&#39;s not going to be<br/>
able to cope in real life.  Ha!  I guess she just thinks I&#39;m stupid.  And I<br/>
went to school for about 18 years.  And look how I turned out - wanting<br/>
nothing good for my son. &lt;sarcasm intended&gt; <br/>

All I can say is I&#39;m ROFL.  So my 10 yo kid who&#39;s making banana bread right now <br/>
(and doubling the<br/>
recipe) won&#39;t be skilled enough to own her own bakery someday if she chooses?  <br/>
I&#39;d better go<br/>
