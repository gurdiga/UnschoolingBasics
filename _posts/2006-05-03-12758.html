<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074685880">When I was writing regarding Zak and studying the Pre-Ged and me just<br/>
now finding out that one has to be at least 18 take it...when I wrote<br/>
about honesty, it totally came out wrong and I didn&#39;t mean to word<br/>
things that way.  This is one of the first times that I&#39;ve ever seen<br/>
him be totally excited about something that was totally self-iniated<br/>
by him outside of video games, he does things but has never really had<br/>
a passion.  His goal was set for the sole purpose of having a GED<br/>
diploma at the age of 12, how can I break this to him without ruining<br/>
his excitement?  He WANTS badly to play football in the fall and<br/>
dreams of going to college in order to play football someday and has<br/>
even went so far as to speak about it professionally.  Maybe I could<br/>
go from there and be encouraging regarding maybe the Pre-GED will help<br/>
prepare him better for SAT/ACT&#39;s and such?  <br/>
<br/>
This is my fault as I was excited with Zak, I should&#39;ve found out this<br/>
info beforehand and I didn&#39;t.  :-(  <br/>

<br/>
The GED Tests may be given to:<br/>

   - Residents of Florida, proof of residency must include either a State<br/>

   or Student Visa<br/>
   - Adults, 18 years of age or older<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068167108">Sandy, I went &quot;for fun&quot; and looked at one of the GED tests that are<br/>
online.  Aside from the annoying popups and blinking ads (who the heck can<br/>
concentrate on a test when bombarded by such I have no idea) and started the<br/>
first part and thought, &quot;What does anyone need to know any of that crap?&quot;<br/>
It was all questions on parts of language.  Poems that need to be dissected<br/>
as if dissecting a poem will make us understand them better.  Stories that<br/>
need broken up into smaller parts for us to understand them?  It was all<br/>
nonsensical to me.  I can enjoy a poem without knowing that there is simile<br/>
or metaphor in it.  I can read a story and comprehend what it is all about<br/>
without having to have it broken down into little parts for my scrutiny!  We<br/>
can learn to use alliteration without knowing it is alliteration.  We can<br/>
use similes and metaphors without knowing what those forms of writing are.<br/>
We use comparisons all the time and never thing, &quot;Ah, I am going to use a<br/>
simile now.&quot;  Has anyone truly ever benefitted from logically placing a<br/>
metaphor somewhere?  I love literature, but I don&#39;t break down all my<br/>
reading into what forms of literature are being used.  If I read a poem and<br/>
enjoy what the poem says I don&#39;t need to tear it apart to understand why a<br/>
certain part effected me.<br/>
<br/>
Your son is still quite young and the information on these GED&#39;s may seem<br/>
extremely overwhelming.  I wonder if showing him a sample test would be<br/>
beneficial or make him feel like he isn&#39;t &quot;worthy.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I agree Michelle, I&#39;m guessing for college placement tests and that is<br/>
the only time they need to know that crap for?  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have went to college, or whose children have<br/>
unschooled since the beginning I just want to make sure that I truly<br/>
understanding unschooling....  From the books I&#39;ve read and the advice<br/>
here, if a child WANTS to go to college I am not wrong to say that &quot;If<br/>
they want to go to college, they are capable of doing what it takes to<br/>
get there including but not limited to; prep tests, courses, etc. When<br/>
a child WANTS to learn they will learn.&quot;  I have John Holt&#39;s book and<br/>
his differences between &quot;T&quot; teaching and &quot;t&quot; teaching was so perfect<br/>
to me and made so much sense.  It&#39;s okay to be taught if you want to<br/>
be taught and it may be hard but if it&#39;s something that YOU want to<br/>
learn and study for etc, it&#39;s okay you&#39;ll learn itand heck, even at<br/>
Walmart they have the &quot;Cliff Notes&quot; series.  However, the other kind<br/>
of teaching is unwanted and forced even for things you aren&#39;t<br/>
interested in.  The other thing...it doesn&#39;t take 12 years to learn<br/>
even the required &#39;learning&#39; for SAT&#39;s and such, does it?  I mean that<br/>
a tutor or doing courses wouldn&#39;t take care of so long as we keep a<br/>
portfolio later on down the road IF they should desire to go to college?<br/>
<br/>
One time I read a site (this was like a year ago) from an unschooled<br/>
teen who said that she was upset that her mom never taught her math or<br/>
pushed it because now she has problems learning it. She blamed her mom<br/>
for not teaching her, I&#39;m guessing there is probably a deeper issue<br/>
here, and blamed her mom that she couldn&#39;t get into college because of<br/>
&#39;pathetic&#39; math scores.  That bothers me because from what I<br/>
understand (not know) college has many choices and you learn what you<br/>
choose to learn in college and take required classes that pertain to<br/>
your degree so WHY do they place emphasis on say &#39;grammar&#39; if your<br/>
child wants to go to college and major in history?  I truly and<br/>
honestly don&#39;t get it.</div>
