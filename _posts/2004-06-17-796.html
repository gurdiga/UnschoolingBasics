<div id="ygrps-yiv-783612582">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I have 4 kids ages 9,7,4 and 2 years old. My oldest 2 just finished<br/>
public school and we have just started our &quot;unschooling&quot;! I<br/>
started looking into homeschooling and read John Holt&#39;s<br/>
books and they had a huge impact on me. My oldest dd is<br/>
dyslexic and was really struggling in school and her confidence was<br/>
getting lower by the day. I really hope to turn that around and make<br/>
learning fun again! We live in Rochester and are looking for some<br/>
homeschooling friends :) But we also plan on taking a lot of field<br/>
trips to the cities!<br/>
