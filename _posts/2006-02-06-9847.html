<div id="ygrps-yiv-153328574">&quot; Now it&#39;s un/homeschool her or<br/>
watch her fail at her education completely.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She wasn&#39;t failing at anything....none of it mattered to her so even<br/>
if she did well at it, what was the point?  No, she wasn&#39;t failing,<br/>
the system was failing HER.<br/>
<br/>
Getting started? She&#39;s FREE. Let her absorb all that glorius freedom<br/>
and not worry about anything. You&#39;re on vacation. Get movies you all<br/>
like to watch, take a road trip, play at the mall, do whatever sounds<br/>
fun. Let her HEAL...she can&#39;t possibly think about interests or<br/>
passions right now...just let her be. Let her re-claim her days as her<br/>
own and eventually you will see interests bubbling up.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, you&#39;re job is to de-school yourself and let your children<br/>
heal. Focus on your relationships with your children, not what they<br/>
are or aren&#39;t doing. That&#39;s the second step towards unschooling....and<br/>
congratulations on taking the all important FIRST step, removing them<br/>
from school!:)<br/>
