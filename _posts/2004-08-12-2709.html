<div id="ygrps-yiv-684045776">I hope I can fit all this info into a quick ameil.  I&#39;m so busy these days...I love reading everyone&#39;s posts and advice but I never seem to have time for my own.   <br/>
<br/>
My son Echo is 3 yrs and 8 mos.  He has always been a mature, cool, laid back kinda guy.  He&#39;s not really loud or rowdy, likes books movies, music and art lately he&#39;s into spiderman and more &quot;guyish&quot; things.  The supposed terrible twos were just a non issue for him, he never has/had tantrums or fits, jjust not his style.  <br/>
<br/>
Recently (last couple of weeks) he is having 1 to 3 major breakdowns per day..on days that he skips nap.  I know the cause...this doesn&#39;t happen until after he has skipped his nap.  He was a 3 hr per day napper until this summer and now he skips his nap a few times a week...we try to get him to bed earlier but it doesn&#39;t always happen.  ANYWAY - these breakdown are most of the time over something &quot;small&quot; (though to him it&#39;s huge).  I think I see the pattern here and I&#39;ve been getting the baby down for nap and then he and I lie in my bed together for his nap...he just never goes to sleep.  So eventually we get up and then later something sets him off and he goes nuts.  <br/>
Also, we&#39;ve tried &quot;quiet time&quot; in place of nap...today for example, we went to lie down 30 min later he&#39;s still awake and saying he doesnt need a nap, we agree on a movie in bed so that he can rest with his &quot;blankie&quot; and I can take care of some things before baby wakes.  Everything was fine...until after lunch.<br/>
<br/>
His sister spilled his raisins and he went into FULL scream &quot;i want my raisins&quot;.  I knew he was getting fired up and I wnated to help him get calm so I led him to his room to get a hold of himself, we couldn&#39;t even talk with him in hysterics like that...he stayed in his room screaming the same phrase for about 3 minutes.  He came out, we talked briefly about being so tired etc and he was fine for several hours.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure...is this normal 3 yr old behavior? <br/>
I think next time, i will try to just hold him before he completely looses it, that may prevent it.  I&#39;ll have to see.  Maybe being in his room makes it worse. <br/>
I would not have a problem with him skipping every nap BUT to me, it&#39;s pretty obvious that he needs the rest.  If a kid doesnt want to nap and can handle daily stress fine but I really think he is simply &quot;grouchy&quot; and tired.  He stays up until 9 or 10 and wakes at 9am.  hope someone can lead us in the right direction here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m worried about him - he&#39;s NEVER done this until recently.<br/>

explore a bit but often crawled back to Mama to reconnect.  I think <br/>
it&#39;s similar to that, but in a more mental than physical way.  HTH<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624831383">my nineteen month old is going through a similar phase...skipping naps and then getting grouchy...I know she&#39;s tired, so some days I just have to hold her and rock her a few minutes while she tantrums and then she calms down and conks out...otherwise she just fights it pretty hard.  I&#39;ve tried snuggling her in bed ( she tries to climb down), movies (she watches them and stays awake)...so know I just stick to music and rocking.  This has been recent for her as well...though I have noticed about 4 new teeth, so that could explain it...now we are in a habit of sleeping later, then napping later...i hope this changes soon :)<br/>

often talk about how 3 was much harder than 2.  My son threw his <br/>
best fits when he was 3.  I either held him or sat next to him and <br/>
rubbed his back when he was having a tantrum.  When he was done I <br/>
would hug him and we could talk about what happened.  It could be <br/>
that 3 year olds have more tantrums because they are in the process <br/>
of giving up naps.  It is hard to be tired, but most kids are done <br/>
with naps by the time they are 4 (in my experience).  When I knew he <br/>
was overtired, I would sit on the couch and put on a movie or <br/>
cartoons and have him lay down with his head in my lap.  He almost <br/>
never feel asleep but the resting and cuddling seemed to help his <br/>
mood.  I think patience and understanding is the only &quot;cure&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-580800260">thanks Christy...I will let you all know how it goes today.  He woke up at<br/>
830 and has been sugary sweet all day.  We&#39;re going out for a few errands<br/>
and when we get in around 12, we&#39;ll try for a a nap.<br/>
BTW - I went to visit a mom I met freecycle the other day.  Her kids are 7<br/>
and 4.  She says they both take a nap everyday no matter what!!!  Wonder how<br/>
she does that??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898990200">I&#39;m sure most of the people here will tell you this is pretty normal<br/>
behavior for a 3 year old, so I&#39;m going to go with the other part of<br/>
the question - i.e. his sleep patterns.  <br/>
<br/>
Children&#39;s sleep patterns do change, so that&#39;s probably normal too. <br/>
Things you should look at just in case would include changes in his<br/>
routine (have his general activities changed much), his exercise (is<br/>
he playing as much as he used to) and of course his diet.  I&#39;m not<br/>
just talking about sugar, caffeine, and chocolate, I&#39;m talking about<br/>
any kinds of changes that might be throwing off his body clock or<br/>
disrupting his digestion.  Also, he may have developed a food<br/>
sensitivity that he did not previously have, so try to keep a general<br/>
track of what he eats and if there is any correlation to his sleep<br/>
patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Again, he could very easily be going through a perfectly natural phase<br/>
and I&#39;m not trying to get you paranoid about his sleep changes - just<br/>
trying to be helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-782778042">One thing you could try to head off the worst of the storm is focusing<br/>
him.  When my son first started throwing major tantrums I would have<br/>
him find my eyes (he was just turning 3, so I actually asked him where<br/>
my eyes were and had him point to them).  When he was actually looking<br/>
at me, I told him to blow and then blew all my breath out for him to<br/>
emulate.  I had him blow five or six times and he usually calmed down<br/>
to a manageable point.  Hope this helps.<br/>

my raisins&quot;.  I knew he was getting fired up and I wnated to help him<br/>
get calm so I led him to his room to get a hold of himself, we<br/>
couldn&#39;t even talk with him in hysterics like that...he stayed in his<br/>
room screaming the same phrase for about 3 minutes.  He came out, we<br/>
talked briefly about being so tired etc and he was fine for several hours.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not sure...is this normal 3 yr old behavior? <br/>
&gt; I think next time, i will try to just hold him before he completely<br/>
looses it, that may prevent it.  I&#39;ll have to see.  Maybe being in his<br/>
room makes it worse. <br/>
&gt; I would not have a problem with him skipping every nap BUT to me,<br/>
it&#39;s pretty obvious that he needs the rest.  If a kid doesnt want to<br/>
nap and can handle daily stress fine but I really think he is simply<br/>
&quot;grouchy&quot; and tired.  He stays up until 9 or 10 and wakes at 9am. <br/>
hope someone can lead us in the right direction here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m worried about him - he&#39;s NEVER done this until recently.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>She does sometimes although she could really use one every day.  Doing <br/>
&quot;quiet time&quot; doesn&#39;t work for her at all.  She&#39;s a very active girl and <br/>
she doesn&#39;t enjoy sitting down to look at books with me or coloring or <br/>
anything like that.  The only time she&#39;s staying (fairly) still is when <br/>
she&#39;s nursing.  But even then she&#39;s flailing all over the place.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
She often falls asleep while nursing so then I just make sure that when <br/>
I sit down I have a book, a drink, the remote and the phone.   If I <br/>
know I&#39;ll be sitting down with her soon I&#39;ll make sure to get my DS a <br/>
drink refill and make him a sandwich or snack also.<br/>
<br/>
My DS was 21 months old when my DD was born and he quit nursing at that <br/>
point.  He wouldn&#39;t just &quot;nap&quot; even if we all laid down.  What saved my <br/>
sanity was car rides.  I&#39;d put them both in their car seats and just <br/>
GO.  Didn&#39;t matter where.  Just drive.  I&#39;d make sure the diaper bag <br/>
was stocked, had snacks and drinks for all of us, and would bring a <br/>
book or magazine for me.  Once they were good and asleep I&#39;d pull over <br/>
in a parking lot or at a park and just read while they snoozed.  I did <br/>
this almost daily for a few months -- it was the only way they&#39;d both <br/>
nap and I also enjoyed time to myself to do some reading.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that&#39;ll help you at all, but that&#39;s what worked me us.  <br/>

&lt;g&gt; Sometimes it just happens! Cameron napped twice daily  (9:00-11:00 & <br/>
1:00-3:30/4:00, plus 12 hours sleep each  night) until he was three, daily until <br/>
he was almost six, and a  lot until he was seven. He&#39;s 16 now and still naps <br/>
2-3 days/week, if he  can.<br/>
 <br/>
I got in &quot;trouble&quot; when I called him a &quot;slug&quot; last year. Basically the  child <br/>
slept and nursed. Only.<br/>

One  thing you could try to head off the worst of the storm is  focusing<br/>
him.  When my son first started throwing major tantrums I  would have<br/>
him find my eyes (he was just turning 3, so I actually asked him  where<br/>
my eyes were and had him point to them).  When he was actually  looking<br/>
at me, I told him to blow and then blew all my breath out for him  to<br/>
emulate.  I had him blow five or six times and he usually calmed  down<br/>
to a manageable point.  Hope this  helps.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s really nice, Daniel. I bet that&#39;ll help lots of new  parents!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-931005995">Geneva, also keep in mind that you really can&#39;t<br/>
&quot;force&quot; someone to go to sleep.  Your son is<br/>
definately at that age where that one nap a day<br/>
generally phases out. *sigh*  I can relate.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

else.Thank goodness for the sleeping times - although sleeping and <br/>
nursing were over the same time - I&#39;d try to put her down somewhere and <br/>
she&#39;d wake up.<br/>
<br/>
I kept her out of kindergarten, initially, because I couldn&#39;t see how <br/>
she&#39;d manage to get through an all-day kindergarten when she was still <br/>
taking a LONG nap every day around noon to 3 or so. Plus she wasn&#39;t <br/>
consistently &quot;potty-trained&quot; at 4 (her birthday is end of November - <br/>
our cut off date for kindergarten is they should be 5 by December 2nd - <br/>
so she made the deadline for starting school that year by just a couple <br/>
of days).<br/>

We were in Germany too (Cam was born there). Our best friends there had a  <br/>
daughter like yours. Even as an infant, she needed little sleep. I did NOT envy  <br/>
her mom! &lt;G&gt; Robin was always tired, &#39;cause *she* needed more sleep than  her <br/>
baby girl!<br/>
 <br/>
Our little &quot;slug&quot; upset all the hospital nurses; they wanted me to wake him  <br/>
up to eat. I figured he&#39;d wake up when he was hungry. He did. Then he&#39;d go <br/>
right  back to sleep! &lt;G&gt; Easy baby!<br/>

infant and only sleeping 10 hours a day.  Now he is 4 and only sleeps <br/>
about 8 hours a night, still not as much as he is &quot;supposed&quot; to.  He <br/>
quit napping before he was 2.  It is good to know other kids don&#39;t <br/>
sleep either.  The bad thing is I need more sleep than he does, so <br/>
I&#39;m always tired!<br/>
