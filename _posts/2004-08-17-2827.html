<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922237275">There is a book called, &quot;Trust Us, We&#39;re Experts&quot; and this was published in  <br/>
one of the book&#39;s reviews:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;From Publishers Weekly<br/>
Recent surveys show  that &quot;national experts&quot; are the third most trusted type <br/>
of public figure (after  Supreme Court justices and schoolteachers). &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Scary, huh?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147207280">And on that same vein (schoolteachers being trusted) I read an article in today in which someone interviewed Laura Bush.  She talked at length about her years as a teacher and librarian, and her views on limiting TV for kids.<br/>
 <br/>
The statement that bothered me most, tho, was &quot;Children have to be taught to read; it isn&#39;t something you learn automatically.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It was also very telling was this, &quot;My mother said she knew I&#39;d be a teacher when she heard me scolding my dolls for not paying attention.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Okay.. so kids must be scolded to pay attention, and must be taught to read, because they can&#39;t be trusted to learn it on their own. So how does that explain all the folks like me (and Gary) who learned to read at age 4 without being taught by anyone.  <br/>
