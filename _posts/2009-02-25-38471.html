<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914251500">Hi Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
How does one find out where there are groups even ones that are not widely published.  I do know of one in my area but the yahoo board is very, very, empty.  ;o(<br/>
<br/>
I have not been back on here in soooooo long and then the other day looking for some inspiration I came on and saw the post for the Unschooling conference and I started dreaming of going this year for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how Dad&#39;s react and feel if they attend with the family if they are not on the same page as the mom??  Like me I have done most of the reading and from John Holt to others on unschooling and it feels so right inside all I have read and what I have seen my kids pick up on just by being with them and taking the world as our guide.  But then getting scared I was not doing it &quot;correctly&quot; (pressure from outside sources) started a more routine and have lost some of the glow with my kids and now I am looking to get that back!  When I say routine it is very little since she turned 8 and was not reading yet after watching my 5yo read with ease that was very hard for me and my 8yo.<br/>
<br/>
Wow what a journey when it seems nobody around you is with you.<br/>

Tell us where you live. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously. Chances are, one of us lives near you or knows of someone nearby. <br/>
<br/>
But as I told Faith &lt;g&gt;, your unschooling *neighbor* may be an hour or more away. I have eight unschooling families coming to my house this weekend. Only two are within an hour (one&#39;s just blocks away). The others are three to nine hours away. Doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t get together; it just takes more work. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have not been back on here in soooooo long and then the other day looking for <br/>
some inspiration I came on and saw the post for the Unschooling conference and I <br/>
started dreaming of going this year for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You realize Live and Learn Conference is no more., right? But there are MANY others around the country---something almost every month!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how Dad&#39;s react and feel if they attend with the family if they are not <br/>
on the same page as the mom??  <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes that&#39;s all it takes to push them over the edge! I know two dads in particular, Jeff Sabo and Austin Gavin, who were really changed by the conferences. I know there are others, but these two have written or spoken about20the impact of the conferences.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some dads lock themselves in their rooms and never come out the whole weekend.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some take baby steps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Each one is an individual! I hope they ALL take home *something* of value to help unschooling work. What *really* makes a difference is the dads who are willing to explore it and who are willing to learn. It&#39;s the ones who shut down automatically who get the least (if not nothing) out of the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Like me I have done most of the reading and from <br/>
John Holt to others on unschooling and it feels so right inside all I have read <br/>
and what I have seen my kids pick up on just by being with them and taking the <br/>
world as our guide.  But then getting scared I was not doing it &quot;correctly&quot; <br/>
(pressure from outside sources) started a more routine and have lost some of the <br/>
glow with my kids and now I am looking to get that back! <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
A conference could be *just* what helps you see the benefits---seeing the older children and how they act, react, and interact with everyone there. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another option would be Cameron&#39;s new list---a place for parents to ask the actual unschoolers---children, teens, and young adults. A yahoogroup:   Ask-Unschooling_Offspring<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 When I say routine it <br/>
is very little since she turned 8 and was not reading yet after watching my 5yo <br/>
read with ease that was very hard for me and my 8yo.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re <br/>
not the first. I&#39;ve read of several families in which the younger child was reading before the older one. That just shows that each child is an individual. It will come to each child when he&#39;s ready.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=- <br/>
<br/>
Wow what a journey when it seems nobody around you is with you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can choose to whine about that or do something about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The community is HUGE compared to what it was 20 years ago! Seriously. Before the easy access to computers, all that unschoolers had was John Holt&#39;s 6x/year Growing Without Schooling magazine. With the internet, we could communicate virtually: I have friends I&#39;ve never met---all around the globe. Then the conferences made an enormous contribution: we got to MEET real, live unschoolers. Now there&#39;s a conference or gathering or noncon almost every MONTH all over North America! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hell, I have an unschooling party at my HOUSE almost every month!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is what you make it. I choose to surround myself with unschoolers. We&#39;re out there---you may have to do some work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-724095736">Angela,<br/>
<br/>
How about posting on your local homeschooling groups for a meet-up?  You could either have it be just parents (Moms&#39; Night Out sort of thing) or a playgroup or both!  Something like &quot;Anyone unschool?  Interested?  Come to _______ Cafe this ____night for coffee and conversation!  Bring your unschooling books and resources!&quot;  There are probably others out there near you in the same predicament!  It&#39;s partly how I found my group! :)<br/>
<br/>
Also wanted to point out that, while it is valuable to have friends who unschool, and I definitely am very grateful for the unschooling group I found near me, it is also helpful to just have friends who are respectful of your choices!!  My best buddy is a school-at-home-er but we have so much in common besides that and our kids have such a great time together, it&#39;s fine.  I just playfully roll my eyes at her when she complains it&#39;s &quot;like pushing a string, Melissa!&quot; sometimes (referring to homeschooling her kid).  She laughs and says, &quot;I know, I know--unschool!&quot;.  She&#39;ll admittedly never go the unschooling route as it just doesn&#39;t make sense to her but it&#39;s fine. <br/>
<br/>
 Also, just because someone STARTS OUT doing school-at-home type homeschooling doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t be converted.  I&#39;ve been evangelising and have brought several over to the Dark Side. :)  Tee Hee.<br/>

I am SO looking forward to seeing everybody again - it&#39;s been a long<br/>
time...okay well maybe only since last spring but that&#39;s a LONG time :-)<br/>
<br/>
As far as dads go, there are lots of great dads at conferences. Ben,<br/>
Kelly&#39;s hubby, is a great one to corral with questions. <br/>
