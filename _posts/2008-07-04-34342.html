Here&#39;s a link from the science list that I thought folks here might be <br/>
interested in as well:<br/>
<br/>
The Lost Ladybug Project<br/>
http://instruct1. cit.cornell. edu/courses/ icb344/Lost_ Ladybugs. htm<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a fun summer project! As has been mentioned here before, <br/>
nature surveys are good way to have fun with &quot;real life&quot; math (in this <br/>
case, counting and measuring ladybugs and identifying them by the <br/>
number of spots they have).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s real life math when the kids, out of a sense of curiosity, start<br/>
counting lady bug spots (or anything else they&#39;re fascinated with)<br/>
just for fun!<br/>
I can see mentioning this if you thought you have a child that would<br/>
like it, but why try to squeeze math in with some contrived project?<br/>
Math happens. All the time, all around us. <br/>
<br/>
Games are fun, counting is fun, but I worry that posts like this send<br/>
the message that unschoolers are still worried about covering subjects<br/>
and just find fun ways to do it. Unschooling is life without<br/>
subjects...just interests and learning because we are curious about<br/>
something.<br/>
