<div id="ygrps-yiv-858779324">Do you think he would understand that a story can be so special that some<br/>
kids really want to believe it? Other kids don¹t have to believe the same<br/>
story. In our house we celebrate the stories of the season ­ all of them<br/>
that we possibly can. Celebrate St. Nikolas day Dec 6 and tell the stories<br/>
about him (no I am not religious in any way). Talk about the history of<br/>
Santa Claus. Learn about how other places around the world celebrate the<br/>
stories of Santa Claus or whatever he is called there. Work with him to<br/>
choose a family or child to give presents to ­ let him be Santa Claus. Maybe<br/>
he will see how lots of kids around him think the stories are so fabulous<br/>
that they want to believe they are real.<br/>

Good Luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249553665">We&#39;ve got an odd situation with &quot;mythical critters&quot; at our house (Santa,<br/>
tooth fairy, etc) - DS (9) doesn&#39;t really believe in them but at the<br/>
same time doesn&#39;t accept the actual situation - he wants to keep the<br/>
magical aspect without the personification. Back when the tooth fairy<br/>
started coming around, he asked me about it. I said &quot;I&#39;ll tell you if<br/>
you want to know&quot; He did. I said &quot;Okay, after you&#39;re asleep, I sneak in<br/>
and take the tooth and put your prize under the pillow&quot; His direct quote<br/>
response was &quot;No, that&#39;s not it&quot; Uh...wait a minute lol. Okay, so what<br/>
does happen do you think? We&#39;ve had everything from aliens to<br/>
transporter beams to &quot;tooth seeds&quot; (the tooth is a seed with a prize<br/>
inside that pops open when it gets put under the pillow). Just the other<br/>
day, he said he really doesn&#39;t think there&#39;s a Santa Claus - there must<br/>
be some sort of transporter beam that beams the presents under the tree.<br/>
Okay, we&#39;ll go with that for now - it&#39;ll probably be something else next<br/>
year.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and DS *knows* that his wishlist is a WISH list - not everything on<br/>
it is something he&#39;ll get for Christmas. BUT he also knows that<br/>
Christmas (and birthdays) are not the only times he can get stuff.<br/>
Whenever he sees something cool that fits the budget, it&#39;s his. He looks<br/>
at prices and even HE thinks that some things are too expensive and<br/>
he&#39;ll just wait until the price comes down a bit first. It&#39;s all tied<br/>
up, I think, with an overall sense of abundance, a sense that his wants<br/>
are taken seriously and given equal priority with everything else. If<br/>
it&#39;s doable, we do it. If it&#39;s the middle of February and we see<br/>
something he didn&#39;t get that he still wants and NOW we&#39;ve got the funds,<br/>
he gets it. So, there&#39;s no sense of desperation involved with Christmas<br/>
(or birthdays). If he doesn&#39;t get something on that one day, there are<br/>
lots of other days and other ways to get it.<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442625377">We told our 6 year old that Santa wasn&#39;t real because she thought Santa was<br/>
going to bring her all kinds of gift, but we had very little money last<br/>
year.  We explained to her that there was no &quot;real&quot; Santa as a person, but<br/>
when people talk about Santa they are are referring to the spirit of<br/>
christmas.  Some people think that that spirit of *kindness*, *loving*, etc<br/>
has to take physical form and parents let their kids belive that and some<br/>
even teach it to them, but &quot;Santa Claus&quot; is not a real person.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who act like Santa and give to people who can&#39;t afford it<br/>
(the salvation army runs a program where families can &quot;adopt&quot; other families<br/>
and buy for them) and there are people who dress up like Santa and sit in<br/>
stores and the mall and stuff.  They are there to remind us that we need to<br/>
*be giving*, *be loving*, and/or *insert your favorite emotion*.<br/>

senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out<br/>
people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to<br/>
learn whatever needs to be learned<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-978764743">Truthfully, one of the things that I loved the most about homeschooling  (and <br/>
specifically unschooling, but it was home vs. school thing that applies  <br/>
here) was that Julian got to hold onto Santa as long as he wanted and needed it.  <br/>
And he at least marginally believed until he was about 11.<br/>
 <br/>
I suspect that he mostly knew way before then, but he still wanted and  <br/>
needed Santa, and he didn&#39;t have to worry about people making fun of him or  <br/>
anything. His best friend was in a traditional school at the time (he later  moved <br/>
to a Sudbury school) but he loved Julian and also wanted him to have it as  <br/>
long as he wanted it.<br/>
 <br/>
Interestingly he was not a kid who wanted to visit Santa at the mall (At  <br/>
four he said &quot;I really don&#39;t want to go sit on a strange man&#39;s lap&quot; which seemed  <br/>
very sane to us), but I think he just liked the idea. He moved very naturally <br/>
to  knowing Santa was a fantasy, and he told us that he never felt we lied to <br/>
 him.<br/>
 <br/>
I asked recently (he&#39;s 18 now) what he would do when he had kids, and he  <br/>
said that if asked he&#39;d never lie (we never did), but that he would have  Santa.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795607941">I have always told my kids the truth about santa claus. They actually <br/>
tell other kids he is not real and parents get so mad at me. But, oh <br/>
well. We just decided that we weren&#39;t gonna lie to or kids about all <br/>
those fictional characters. The way it is so commercialized now and <br/>
santa is always in the kids faces, my 3dd started questioning me about <br/>
it last year. I sat down with all the kids and explained to them about <br/>
the origins of christmas and how santa claus came about and that now <br/>
it&#39;s just someone dressed up in a costume. Just about every holiday we <br/>
do this now, we learn about the origins of the holidays and neat stuff.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439695088">We have always explained to our kids when they were old enough to ask<br/>
questions (at whatever age that arrived for each kid) that Santa was a<br/>
nice tradition based on a historical character but the whole Santa<br/>
process in our time is make believe.   I don&#39;t offer that information<br/>
until they ask... until that time we play Santa.... when they want<br/>
something out of the budget I just remind that there are lots of kids<br/>
that Santa brings gifts to so they should only ask for a few things so<br/>
everyone can have toys from Santa  (we ask our kids to put 5 things on<br/>
their Santa list that they REALLY want most.  It eventually becomes<br/>
just a fun tradition... none of my kids have been traumatized when<br/>
they found out Santa wasn&#39;t real nor did any of them feel they had<br/>
been mislead or lied to... of course I always have told them the truth<br/>
when they asked at whatever point.    <br/>
Maybe explaining to your child that the other children are playing a<br/>
make believe game so to speak with their parents as far as Santa is<br/>
concerned (I would never want my child to ruin the magic for another<br/>
child so I would caution him somehow about that)  Someone else&#39;s idea<br/>
about parents have to help Santa so $ is a factor might be good since<br/>
your budget is limited this year.   <br/>
Good luck!<br/>

 <br/>
i was never raised to believe in santa either an neither were my kids  <br/>
(either set) but sometimes the older set would decide to for fun, lol. what i  told <br/>
them then and tell the little ones now, is that santa is an idea, and all  <br/>
that gift gifts are playing the role of santa. we can all be santa - and part of  <br/>
that is giving anonymously, which is why some people like to believe in santa <br/>
as  a real being. santa IS real - as real as any belief or thing that cannot <br/>
be seen  or touched. love is an example that can be used for that, too. then, <br/>
on to the  other parents, lol, THAT is harder! lol! i&#39;d tell the same info, <br/>
and the parents  want their children to believe in a little &quot;magic&quot; and that is <br/>
how they show  their love to their kids. you, we, do that differently, but the <br/>
result is the  same in the long run....of course I&#39;ve had to alter how this <br/>
is said to make the  ideas and terms age friendly...<br/>
 <br/>
its always a toughie!<br/>

<h4>ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH</h4>
<p><small><time>26 Nov 2007, at 12:45pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140807531">What are people&#39;s opinions of telling kids that Santa<br/>
Claus is real? We never did with my kids, and now my<br/>
youngest is coming into contact with other children<br/>
who think that Santa Claus is real. I&#39;m trying to<br/>
explain to my 6 year old about a fictional character,<br/>
but all these other kids keep insisting he&#39;s real.<br/>
=================================<br/>
 <br/>
I told Simon and Linnaea this year that we acted as Santa Claus. I&#39;d done all of the magical gifters, like the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy and it had always weighed on me. I don&#39;t know why, really. I had loved all of those creatures as a child and had not felt sad or deceived upon discovering the truth, but there was something in my being the deceiver that bothered me. Neither were bothered. I was worried that Linnaea would be distraught, but she made her own peace, she said that David and I were so good to her that she didn&#39;t feel a need for Santa Claus. She said that she imagined there were other children who needed Santa to be generous to them. She still believes there is a Santa Claus, but he is a bringer of joy and not goods. <br/>
<br/>
==================<br/>
It bugs me because now what I can&#39;t afford to buy my<br/>
son for Christmas, he thinks Santa is going to bring<br/>
him. We already struggle with materialism with him...<br/>
this isn&#39;t making things any easier. And what do I do?<br/>
Tell these other kids that their parents are liars and<br/>
Santa Claus isn&#39;t real? What the heck do I tell my son?<br/>
====================<br/>
 <br/>
I would worry less about what you tell your son and more about your concern with materialism. Humans are materialistic. Just are. In 1626 Peter Minuit managed to buy Manhattan from some Native Americans for beads and trinkets worth about $28. People like stuff. <br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is that on the run up to this Christmas Simon and Linnaea can&#39;t really think of much stuff that they want. They&#39;ll enjoy the getting of things, but they really don&#39;t feel needy enough to hope for the piles and piles of stuff that never really make you happy, but you really hook your hopes and dreams onto, or at least I did for a long, long time. They get what they want mostly when they want it. If we can&#39;t afford it in that moment, we think and strive and save or look for things that we can trade in or sell to make it work. I can&#39;t remember a time when as a child I went to the store with my mom and she offered to get me something and I turned it down. My daughter, who has a love of clothes that makes me smile, will walk away from an outfit that she doesn&#39;t think works as well as another outfit. And it isn&#39;t because she isn&#39;t materialistic, it&#39;s because she isn&#39;t needy. I was needy. I equated love with stuff. <br/>
<br/>
I would listen to my son about the things he hopes Santa will bring in the face of your own lack of funds. I would write them down and spend time looking at ways to make those gifts possible. I would spend time scouring ebay for used goods or Craigs Lists or asking relatives if they could help out with these wishes. If you aren&#39;t going to give a magical giver you need to be that giver. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to direct your son&#39;s responses to his believing friends, just tell him to be sensitive to their faith. I have talked to Simon and Linnaea about those people who believe and how they need to let them revel in their own relationship with Santa Claus. As an atheist who often finds herself amidst theists I know it can be hard, but it helps more to be kind and supportive of someone else&#39;s magical world than to crash it down with stories of parents as liars. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848998868">It isn&#39;t really oh, well. Your children are hurting other people&#39;s relationship with Santa Claus, with the holidays, with their parents. I can remember when kids at school told me there wasn&#39;t a Santa Claus. IIt was a boy who we used to carpool with to school. I can picture his face, I can remember hating him so much for those words. It was mean and hurtful. It made me feel bad and it made me question things I wasn&#39;t ready to question. Maybe you should take the time to talk to your children about being sensitive to other children&#39;s understanding of the world. I can understand if they are answering when another child asks if they believe in Santa Claus, but to just tell them that their parents are lying, to be so unprepared to bend to another&#39;s needs, I would be disturbed by that. <br/>

<br/>
I have always told my kids the truth about santa claus. They actually <br/>
tell other kids he is not real and parents get so mad at me. But, oh <br/>
well. We just decided that we weren&#39;t gonna lie to or kids about all <br/>
those fictional characters.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980667227">We told our 6 year old that Santa wasn&#39;t real because she thought Santa was<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; going to bring her all kinds of gift, but we had very little money last<br/>
&gt; year.  We explained to her that there was no &quot;real&quot; Santa as a person, but<br/>
&gt; when people talk about Santa they are are referring to the spirit of<br/>
&gt; christmas.  Some people think that that spirit of *kindness*, *loving*,<br/>
&gt; etc<br/>
&gt; has to take physical form and parents let their kids belive that and some<br/>
&gt; even teach it to them, but &quot;Santa Claus&quot; is not a real person.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***At our house we call it &quot;The Spirit of Santa&quot; in which we&#39;re honoring the<br/>
generosity and selflessness of the season by giving and being kind to<br/>
others. The kids have been giving *Santa Spirit* gifts since they were<br/>
small. We acknowledge those who dress up, again in the Spirit of Santa, to<br/>
remind folks of the wonderful parts of the holiday. Santa&#39;s not any *one*<br/>
person, to us, Santa is *anyone* who personifies what Christmas means on an<br/>
emotional level, the it-feels-good-to-make-others-happy way.<br/>
Santa&#39;s *not* about materialism, at least not at my house. It&#39;s about<br/>
squeezing really tight and being more generous than I ever thought possible<br/>
with what I know I don&#39;t have yet somehow it all works out. It&#39;s amazing<br/>
what I find I can live without (sometimes it&#39;s my pride) every year in order<br/>
to get a special Santa Gift for Xmas Day (We open the other gifts on<br/>
Solstice).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536294955">LOL I don&#39;t think I could get everything on my son&#39;s<br/>
list. We got a catalog from Toys R Us in the mail and<br/>
he circled nearly every single toy in the book. Then<br/>
he did the same with the Target catalog. Every time we<br/>
go out, be it the grocery store, pet store, mall, or<br/>
hardware store he pesters me to buy him something. And<br/>
he does the same with his relatives.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s to the point that I make sure we eat a meal or<br/>
have a snack before we head out (or at least make sure<br/>
my son eats something). We&#39;ll be 5 minutes on the road<br/>
and he starts whining about being hungry and how badly<br/>
he needs chicken nuggets to eat. Even if I point out<br/>
that he just ate a bunch of goldfish crackers and told<br/>
me he was &quot;full&quot; before we left, he then insists that<br/>
he was only full of goldfish crackers and now he is<br/>
hungry and really needs chicken nuggets (or candy or a<br/>
donut, etc). <br/>
<br/>
Talking to him won&#39;t get him to stop bugging me to buy<br/>
him something (or something to eat). And he starts<br/>
crying. Eventually, after talking doesn&#39;t work, I<br/>
ignore him. He&#39;s not going to get something every time<br/>
we go out. I thought it was a phase or something, but<br/>
it&#39;s been going on for a few years now and I&#39;m really<br/>
tired of it. And now I&#39;m being told, &quot;Well, Santa will<br/>
get this for me because he loves me. You don&#39;t love me<br/>
because you won&#39;t get me this.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-339533299">Dears<br/>
<br/>
I am not disturbed by your seeming realistic views. I am just wondering why you find it necessary to destroy your children&#39;s magical views in the name of honesty.<br/>
<br/>
All fairy tales, myths and other ancient sagas as well as &#39;saintly biographies&#39; (of which santa (St Nicholaus) is one) evolved to satisfy a soul need and hunger, that &#39;honest realism&#39; can never ever satisfy.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned this thread to my youngest daughter, 22, with two lovely little girls, and she immediately said, &quot;When Santa Claus is not &#39;real&#39; any more, angels loose their &#39;truth&#39; and power and I would not want that for myself or my children. I believe in Santa and the fairies of the universe and every other part of fantasy. It is part of my creativity.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, speaking as Ulrike I want to add that I find that every fairy tale contains valid messages for modern man and woman whithin its symbolic language or soul speak.<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead, disenchant your children, so that they can, with struggle, relearn the language of the soul when they are grown.<br/>
<br/>
The success of Disney&#39;s fairy tale movies clearly shows that the essence of fairy tales satisfy the need of certain human archetypes.<br/>
<br/>
Monsters under the bed exist and, even though you and the child know its not real, does the monster know? Because you know Santa doesn&#39;t exist, he does not bring you any presents anymore. He does to others though (us included).<br/>
 <br/>
For me, telling children the stark realistic truth of no santa falls in the same category as teaching them to read before they are ready, or insisting on facts of history when for them the universe started when they became self aware.<br/>
<br/>
You might do well to start believing in Santa again yourself, instead of taking this belief away from your children. Watch the Secret and understand that the Genie is more real than your seeming realistic views. Take away Santa (and any of the other fairy tale creatures) and you limit the Universe&#39;s ways of granting you your desires to the measly three or less ways you can barely imagine for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Dears, I am really talking to you grown up people here. Anyone who does not believe in Santa is a poor minded person in my not so humble opinion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-994036385">We never did the Santa thing....I believed in Santa and found out at school<br/>
that it was make believe. I was very embarrassed by the whole thing and<br/>
didn&#39;t want my kids to have to have that happen (I decided that long before<br/>
we homeschooled, let alone unschooled).  But given  my experience, I also<br/>
didn&#39;t  want my kids to be the one to traumatize some poor kid.  We love<br/>
pretend and make believe and Santa was just one of many make believe<br/>
characters as my kids grew up. Right up there with Mickey Mouse, Big Bird,<br/>
their imaginary friend....but we never had presents from Santa.  (I love<br/>
picking out special presents for my kids and wanted to get the credit!)<br/>
Christmas was and still is a very magical special time at our house, with or<br/>
without Santa.  My first three kids were pretty good about not spoiling the<br/>
magic for other kids. They never had a problem going along with the whold<br/>
Santa thing. We talked about different families having different traditions<br/>
and how special it was for them...but my 4th child never wanted anything to<br/>
do with Santa (big strange man in a very strange suit...no way!). And he<br/>
tends to be very honest, so a little white lie to spare the feelings of<br/>
another child just didn&#39;t work for him. So we taught him the child&#39;s version<br/>
of &quot;pass the bean dip&quot;.  We role played conversations and ways to answer<br/>
them. If he was asked directly &quot;do you believe in Santa?&quot;  He would answer<br/>
something along the line of &quot;I can hardly wait for Christmas morning! What<br/>
are you hoping to get?&quot; Or something along that line, basically, teaching<br/>
him to redirect the question back to the other child with a different<br/>
conversation. For kids young enough to believe in Santa, it was pretty<br/>
effective. It was tricky for a couple of years because we have baby sat a<br/>
girl since she was 5 and she believed in Santa and her Mom did the Santa<br/>
thing big at their house. We managed to get through those years without<br/>
spoiling it for her (now that she&#39;s almost 11 she doesn&#39;t believe any more).<br/>
It was tricky sometimes though. I don&#39;t have agree with other parents and<br/>
the Santa thing, but I can certainly respect their right to do that and not<br/>
impose our way on them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-162028867">It seems to me that you are arguing that without magic and fairies and unicorns and dragons the world is a place without wonder. I live in a world devoid of magic but full of wonder. Today we went to a museum filled with the most amazing sculptures and carvings and paintings, the Francis Bacon pieces disturbed us all. But as we wandered about looking at these beautiful creations we found a sculpture of Venus who glittered and shone, and as we drew near we discovered that she was covered in the fine filiments of webs spun by hundreds of spiders who found her bumpy surface the best possible surface for catching the bugs for which they hungered. It was wonderful, but it wasn&#39;t the act of a fairy or a magical creature, it was spiders&#39; works that fascinated us. <br/>

 &quot;magik&quot;) of reality - space, earth, rocks, stars, water, meadows, small <br/>
woodland  creatures, et al. i know for fact that not believing in santa or fairies <br/>
or  any other mythological or imaginary creature does not create a poor <br/>
minded  person. those are wonderful things to believe in, to enjoy and have in your <br/>
 heart, yes! but i&#39;m not limited, nor is my imagination because I do not. <br/>
 <br/>
we all need to respect other&#39;s beliefs, yes. that i hold as a truth. but i  <br/>
admit, i feel a bit slighted in hearing that i am poor minded. though since i  <br/>
know full well i am not, perhaps this should not have agitated me. and i,  <br/>
perhaps, have misunderstood your point.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-837515564">We just waited until the kids asked about it and then asked &quot;What do you <br/>
think?&quot;  I tended to give them a playful smile and avoid the question.  But I&#39;d be <br/>
honest if they really pressed me, I just don&#39;t remember how much they did.  <br/>
They figured it out quickly enough though.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as presents, we all like having the ones from each other under the <br/>
tree before Christmas, so they start appearing as they&#39;re bought and wrapped.  <br/>
And tags on the first ones usually say they&#39;re from the pets.  We wonder about <br/>
how they&#39;re able to do the shopping, and joke about the dog sneaking out late <br/>
at night for a sale and how hard it must be for the cat to use the keyboard <br/>
when ordering things over the internet, and wrap presents without having <br/>
opposable thumbs.  <br/>
 <br/>
So then when Christmas day comes and a few anonymous presents show up <br/>
mysteriously, it&#39;s all part of the game.  Then they&#39;re free to make up whatever they <br/>
think is really going on, and add to it.  <br/>
 <br/>
Last year I think my daughter&#39;s stuffed rabbit got me something nice, so that <br/>
reminds me, this year I&#39;ll have to be sure to return the favor.<br/>

I wonder how he doesn&#39;t seem to find as much enjoyment in reality as I do and he wonders how I could possibly not LOVE fantasy.  Neither of us can explain it, but we are just complete opposites when it comes to this!  As much as I can&#39;t understand him in that aspect, it is what draws me to him and as much as he can&#39;t understand me, he is drawn to my grasp on reality.  <br/>
<br/>
We do Santa here and most of it is majorly *played* up by him.  We started a tradition with our little ones a couple of years ago where we make an elf door every Christmas Eve and have an elf party where we eat everything miniature, eat from miniature plates, drink from miniature cups, and eat at a little table.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was little we did Santa and at a certain age (I think around age 8) my mom told us that it was our turn to create the Santa experience for our younger siblings.  For three years my brother and I got to be Santa for our little sister.  We had so much fun and it lightened the blow that Santa was not *real*.  <br/>

do with Santa (big strange man in a very strange suit...no way!). And he<br/>
tends to be very honest, so a little white lie to spare the feelings of<br/>
another child just didn&#39;t work for him. So we taught him the child&#39;s version<br/>
of &quot;pass the bean dip&quot;. We role played conversations and ways to answer<br/>
them. If he was asked directly &quot;do you believe in Santa?&quot; He would answer<br/>
something along the line of &quot;I can hardly wait for Christmas morning! What<br/>
are you hoping to get?&quot; Or something along that line, basically, teaching<br/>
him to redirect the question back to the other child with a different<br/>
conversation. For kids young enough to believe in Santa, it was pretty<br/>
effective. <br/>

I really like that. It&#39;s very kind and honors both children :) <br/>

honest if they really pressed me, I just don&#39;t remember how much they did. <br/>
They figured it out quickly enough though. <br/>
<br/>
As far as presents, we all like having the ones from each other under the <br/>
tree before Christmas, so they start appearing as they&#39;re bought and wrapped. <br/>
And tags on the first ones usually say they&#39;re from the pets. We wonder about <br/>
how they&#39;re able to do the shopping, and joke about the dog sneaking out late <br/>
at night for a sale and how hard it must be for the cat to use the keyboard <br/>
when ordering things over the internet, and wrap presents without having <br/>
opposable thumbs. <br/>
<br/>
So then when Christmas day comes and a few anonymous presents show up <br/>
mysteriously, it&#39;s all part of the game. Then they&#39;re free to make up whatever they <br/>
think is really going on, and add to it. <br/>
<br/>
Last year I think my daughter&#39;s stuffed rabbit got me something nice, so that <br/>
reminds me, this year I&#39;ll have to be sure to return the favor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705934492">~~It might not be the child&#39;s fault, but it seems a disservice to both<br/>
your own children and these other children to not at least talk to<br/>
your children about how much it might hurt to be told that Santa isn&#39;t<br/>
real.~~<br/>
<br/>
Sure. But how realistic is it to expect a young child to remember that<br/>
it might be hurtful? They are simply going to share information as<br/>
they know it. No different than other information. Basically, you&#39;re<br/>
asking someone to stay silent when they know different information<br/>
than someone else. How fair is that?<br/>
<br/>
People share information. That is so natural for a child. Some kids<br/>
are going to have a much harder time staying silent than others. My<br/>
kids heard from people that didn&#39;t believe in Santa when they were<br/>
still wanting to buy into the myth, but we just said &quot;everyone<br/>
believes something different...it&#39;s all ok&quot;. Same with God. Same with<br/>
the tooth fairy. They&#39;re going to run into different beliefs on<br/>
everything...how can you prevent that hurt? <br/>
<br/>
Parents can remind a child that it might be hurtful, I don&#39;t think<br/>
it&#39;s realistic to expect a kid to stay silent every time they<br/>
encounter a conversation about something as innocent as Santa.<br/>
