<div id="ygrps-yiv-355967194">I need some help with how i can engage my son in trying new things.<br/>
I read something that said an unschooling mom shouldn&#39;t do nothing as<br/>
a cover for her being *lazy* and/or listless. well, that&#39;s how i feel.<br/>
I mean my son is playing a video game or watching t.v. and in the pool<br/>
during the day but i feel like i&#39;m not doing anything. I don&#39;t know<br/>
how to talk to him or how to help him get interested in stuff besides<br/>
asking<br/>
and when i do he doesn&#39;t want to talk more then a few words about<br/>
something.<br/>
 let me give an example: we read and build things,we have tons of<br/>
legos and knex and blocks and he asks me to build things but most of<br/>
the time he wants to  watch t.v. or play video games...no problem for<br/>
me...i just feel like i should be discussing things with him more or<br/>
doing more.<br/>
instead of just sitting at the computer while he does his own<br/>
thing...I need help facilitating his learning! <br/>
He is 6 1/2 yo.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461894758">Have you tried being interested in what he&#39;s doing on the<br/>
computer/videogame or what he&#39;s watching on TV? What are you doing that<br/>
he can see? Not as a way to &#39;get him&#39; to do other things, but are you<br/>
pursuing your own interests, exploring new things, yourself? For<br/>
instance, I had a hankering to try making soap a year or so ago. I went<br/>
out and got some pre-prepared glycerin stuff (just melt it in the<br/>
microwave and add color, scents, etc and pour into a mold - I wasn&#39;t so<br/>
interested as to go into making it from scratch with lye etc). We had a<br/>
great time - DS wandered in and out at will, made color suggestions,<br/>
picked out molds, made a few himself, but it was -my- project so he<br/>
could choose his level of participation (from none to spending an hour<br/>
or more with me). I&#39;ll probably be heading out to get more of it in the<br/>
near future because it&#39;s been a while and I want to do it again.<br/>

<br/>
Oh my gosh!  I love making soap and basically the same thing happened years back when <br/>
I learned how to make soap ... well and other things too like sugar scrubs and such.  My <br/>
son loved it all.  We still have some of the soaps that he made.  He even sold some at a <br/>
homeschool fair.  But more than that it lead him into this whole interest in what we call <br/>
&quot;potion making&quot;.  He created his own little lab that eventually turned into a store.  His <br/>
potions became odd concoctions of &quot;stuff&quot; but he bottled it, priced it, made a pretend <br/>
scanner, made labels, signs for all over the house for his store, bags, receipts, cash <br/>
register ... the works.  It was the most adorable thing.  He still talks about it.  You just <br/>
never know how your own interests can inspire your kids.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that though we are in a different place and DS does not quite engage as easily.  <br/>
Although, I went out to work in my little flower garden last week and asked him if he&#39;d <br/>
come out and hang with me.  He did and ended up doing some edge work for me.  That <br/>
was not my goal ... it just happened.  My goal was to just hang out and enjoy each other&#39;s <br/>
company.  It was good. <br/>
<br/>
I say that he does not engage as easily but I myself have not been so engaged either.  <br/>
We&#39;ve had some icky life junk plus a long winter of SAD for me.  I&#39;m working on myself ... <br/>
digging out my creativity - my enthusiasm for life again.  I&#39;m working through a book <br/>
called &quot;Walking In This World&quot; which has been fabulous.  The interesting thing (keeping <br/>
with the conversation) is that during a conversation with DS a couple of weeks ago he <br/>
expressed how he wished that I would start sewing again and that dad would do his wood <br/>
working.  That came about when I shared my &quot;artist date&quot; (see Walking In This World or <br/>
Artist Way) experience to a quilt shop I had never been in that fired my butt up! lol  I <br/>
wonder ... why would DS wish that?  He must have liked the creative energy - the <br/>
productivity I guess.  So I plan in the near future to dust off the ole sewing machine - not <br/>
just for him but for me as well.  It felt good getting so excited about what I saw in that <br/>
quilt shop.  <br/>
<br/>
Even though I &quot;know&quot; I still get concerned about where we are and the example I am for <br/>
my DS.  I get concerned about not providing enough -- what would you say --- <br/>
inspiration or the possibility of inspiration for him.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS .... BUT ... DS began to teach me how to play WoW today!  Oh boy!  It&#39;s going to be a <br/>
long haul of learning.</div>

<br/>
I need some help with how i can engage my son in trying new things.<br/>
I read something that said an unschooling mom shouldn&#39;t do nothing as<br/>
a cover for her being *lazy* and/or listless. well, that&#39;s how i feel.<br/>
I mean my son is playing a video game or watching t.v. and in the pool<br/>
during the day but i feel like i&#39;m not doing anything. I don&#39;t know<br/>
how to talk to him or how to help him get interested in stuff besides<br/>
asking<br/>
and when i do he doesn&#39;t want to talk more then a few words about<br/>
something.<br/>
 let me give an example: we read and build things,we have tons of<br/>
legos and knex and blocks and he asks me to build things but most of<br/>
the time he wants to  watch t.v. or play video games...no problem for<br/>
me...i just feel like i should be discussing things with him more or<br/>
doing more.<br/>
instead of just sitting at the computer while he does his own<br/>
thing...I need help facilitating his learning!<br/>
He is 6 1/2 yo.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you read Sandra&#39;s article &quot;Leaning on a Truck&quot;? Go to her site and <br/>
read that. It&#39;s about talking while doing.<br/>
<br/>
Do you talk about what *he* is interested in or are you trying to bring <br/>
up subjects on your own? Do you understand the video games? Do you talk <br/>
about the tv shows he watches?<br/>
<br/>
Do you have Netflix? Can you rent movies he would like? That&#39;s a GREAT <br/>
place to start talking---about the characters and the plot and the <br/>
scenery, etc. Not &quot;schoolishly&quot;---but like, with Bugs Bunny: &quot;I would <br/>
love to visit Albuquerque one day. I hear they have a huge hot air <br/>
balloon festival where the sky is FULL of giant balloons.&quot; Or with <br/>
Batman, &quot;When I was a kid, my bother would be Robin, and I would be <br/>
Batman, and we&#39;d play like my grandmother&#39;s giant magnolia tree was the <br/>
batcave and jump from branch to branch. And when you were little, you <br/>
used to wear a Batman costume every day. They didn&#39;t have costumes when <br/>
I was little, but I used a towel.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Get cool pool toys and play with him in the pool. Years ago we had a <br/>
water-proof stop watch which was fun to clock how long they could hold <br/>
their breath or how long it took them to swim from end-to-end.<br/>
<br/>
Learn to play the video games.<br/>
<br/>
Get OUT! Go do something. Go out to eat at ethnic restaurants. Go to <br/>
the beach or mountains or stream---somewhere different.<br/>
<br/>
Train the dog. Plant a garden. Paint a room.<br/>
<br/>
Be interested in what he loves. Be interesting by doing what you love. <br/>
Plan something new every day. Doesn&#39;t have to be big. Make pizza dough. <br/>
Make mozerella cheese. Something!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know, this makes me think of the lists I used to make about what <br/>
my kids &quot;learned&quot; in a given day. Maybe you could make some lists <br/>
for yourself of the things you *do* in a given week and then, if you <br/>
still feel like its not &quot;enough&quot; find ways to expand some of those <br/>
things. <br/>
<br/>
Pool toys are a good idea for ways to &quot;do more&quot;. Its a good time of <br/>
year to look for them, too. And think about other things that could <br/>
*become* pool toys. Plastic toys of all kinds. Containers with lids <br/>
that you can fill with water or other toys. Anything that could <br/>
possibly be a &quot;boat&quot; - like plastic dishes and bowls. Clear vinyl <br/>
hose from the hardware store (er... be warned- it makes a great way <br/>
to squirt water at grumpy dads). <br/>
<br/>
Did y&#39;all ever get a trampoline? Have you tried it with different <br/>
size balls? Lots of fun.<br/>
