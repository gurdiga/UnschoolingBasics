<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541694034">- Thank you for writing this.  It is something I need to hear.  I have<br/>
been attempting to fully embrace the unschooling life for a few years<br/>
and math is my biggest stumbling block. Would you mind sharing ways<br/>
your children explored math without using a text. I&#39;m new to this list<br/>
and haven&#39;t post an intro yet. If it&#39;s OK I&#39;ll do it now. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Katy and I have 3 children-an almost 18year old going off to<br/>
college next year.  She was at home until 8th, to a public high school<br/>
for 2 1/2 years decided she hated the environment and went to<br/>
community college.<br/>
   <br/>
My next oldest is a 14 yo boy He was at home through 4th, ps for 5th,<br/>
home for 6th. He wanted to try a choice school for the next year.<br/>
That&#39;s where he&#39;s been, but now he realizes some things about people,<br/>
school, control issues, and has decided to come home after this<br/>
semester ends.  <br/>
My youngest(dd) was at home until 2nd, and then was in ps for 2nd &<br/>
3rd & home the past 2 years.  None of them have any desire to ever<br/>
return to ps. Part of me is distressed they experience ps, but another<br/>
part is glad they know what it *really* is and that they made an<br/>
informed choice.  Anyway, hope to read more great inspirations!<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Katy <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to remember when we started becoming interested in<br/>
unschooling.  I&#39;m thinking it was about the time my oldest was 12 or 13? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784687512">This is motivating to me (and feels like freedom!) b/c I have a 12 yro <br/>
that is basically unschooling except for ...dadum... math. I still have <br/>
her working in a work book for math b/c it freaks me out a little if I <br/>
don&#39;t. Could I possible let it go and let my child live and learn <br/>
completely free!?!?! oh the possibilities! Radical Unschooling, sounds <br/>
better all the time!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Katy,<br/>
<br/>
My girls did lots of computer software.  Software of all kinds about <br/>
stuff they were interested in and it often included math.  When they <br/>
were working on something they would ask me questions, sometimes about <br/>
math, and need to know how to do it to get to the next level. So at <br/>
that moment, I would show them how to do it, in the easiest shortest <br/>
manner possible.<br/>
Real life did most of the teaching, for instance, we have a back yard <br/>
pool, so when I was deciding how much chemical to put in for the number <br/>
of gallons of water I would talk all this outloud to them.  It&#39;s really <br/>
great because they can now &#39;pool sit&#39; when hubby and I leave town.:0)  <br/>
One other thing my gilrs enjoyed, and I don&#39;t even know if they are <br/>
still being published, but Highlights magazine put out these little <br/>
books called math mania, they had fun with those on car trips.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t use them like workbooks or anything though, they were free to <br/>
page through them and do what looked fun.  Another thing is hubby <br/>
showed them lots of cool calculator tricks, like how they will add <br/>
fractions or automatically compute square root with the press of a <br/>
button. Plus playing with fun patterns, I really don&#39;t know what all, <br/>
it was something fun they did with Dad.  I think they even had a little <br/>
book that was called &#39;fun with the calculator&#39; or somehting like that.  <br/>
They both said that knowing their way around a calculator was very <br/>
valuable for learning to conquer the ACT.  They were able to see a lot <br/>
of shortcuts that saved them time.<br/>
Really though, don&#39;t worry, even if they learn none of that it is still <br/>
ok, when they want or need to know math they will then learn it easily <br/>
and joyfully and for a purpose.  If they BOMB the math on the ACt, it <br/>
is still OK, community college will admit them and place them in the <br/>
appropriate math class.  I know this for sure because one of my <br/>
daughters&#39; unschooling friends started in a basic math class for this <br/>
reason, she aced the class, and went on....guess what...this time next <br/>
year she&#39;ll be a nurse.  See??  She learned all the math she needed.  <br/>
Ended up taking two extra classes and those counted towards electives <br/>
anyway.<br/>

<br/>
My 10 dd LOVES theses books!  Math has always been a favorite of hers.  My<br/>
mother, who is a retired school teacher, ordered these for her. She wanted<br/>
to make sure she continued to learn math once we took her out of the public<br/>
school system. :-~ We have fun working some of them together.  Madison uses<br/>
them a lot at night when her dad and I need the house to be quieter so we<br/>
can sleep.<br/>

My kids get highlights, but I haven&#39;t seen anything about that  book....ummmm <br/>
I&#39;m just wondering, do your kids get involved in stuff like sports  or 4-H?<br/>
