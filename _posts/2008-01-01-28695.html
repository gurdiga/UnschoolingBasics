<div id="ygrps-yiv-35279994">-Hi Steve,<br/>
I got a few questions since it sounds like you are new to homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>
Is this internship something your daughter wants to or is it to keep her busy?<br/>
Her decision or yours?<br/>
Is she interested in baking? or interested in another aspect of the business?<br/>
When I turned 16 I quit school for a couple of years to go to another country and work as a dog handler assistant.<br/>
that is what I wanted to do, work with dogs.<br/>
It was a priceless experience and I work my (than little) behind off.<br/>
But it was my sole choice and decision and my parents only supported me on it.<br/>
What are your expectations? Not that you should not expect a 15 year old to take it seriously as I know I did when I was young. But be open to her not liking it and wanting to quit.<br/>
What are her expectations?Does she have any?<br/>
Alex<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-589863640">Thanks for the reply Alex.  Totally her idea.  She&#39;s a very focused and <br/>
mature 15, one of the reasons school has been so frustrating for <br/>
her.  She  loves to bake, especially the more gourmet recipes, and loves <br/>
the atmosphere of the independent, eclectic cafe.<br/>
<br/>
Her expectations are nothing more than to try it, learn about baking and a <br/>
little about the business of baking.<br/>
<br/>
My initial plan is to map out the expectations on both side, start with a <br/>
two day a week schedule and a one-month evaluation period where both sides <br/>
see if it works well for them, with weekly evaluations.  If it works I&#39;d <br/>
like a 3 month commitment from each side.  At the end of three we would <br/>
again evaluate, with my daughter receiving a written evaluation and a <br/>
letter of recommendation, provided she has earned one, when the internship <br/>
ends.<br/>
<br/>
But I do not have any experience with internships so do not know if this is <br/>
reasonable or not.<br/>

We get to work together once a week, too. Our commitment is that I will do<br/>
my best to produce baked goods to his standards; he will make those<br/>

provides opportunities for my creativity, within the parameters he has set<br/>
for his shop; I support him in having the best baked goods in town :D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-697849212">Thanks Diana.  I think you&#39;re right about making it a little less <br/>
formal.  When we get our idea of what my daughter is looking for we&#39;ll meet <br/>
with the baker and see what she is looking for.  I&#39;m thinking maybe one day <br/>
a week for the first month and then evaluate the process.  I want my <br/>
daughter to schedule enough sessions to become comfortable with the <br/>
situation and think that at least four to eight sessions might do that for <br/>
her.  Sounds like our cafe&#39;s are similar.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s never had a job outside the home, but does make herbal hot/cold packs <br/>
and has sold a number of those.  She made her first retail store sale this <br/>
Christmas.  A milestone for her.  She also loves to write and has been <br/>
published a few times, twice in New Moon magazine, once actually getting a <br/>
check for her story, another milestone.  She&#39;s torn between her desire for <br/>
freedom, and sleep, and her impatience to experience the world instead of <br/>
sitting in a classroom being spoon-fed a distorted view of it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the input.  I&#39;ll pass along your comments.<br/>

that is JUST what I would have said, if I had found the words :) I too baked <br/>
- LOVED IT - though what *I* baked and made were bagels, I now love to bake <br/>
cakes and what-not at home and one want to own a cafe. I will, too :) Anyway, I <br/>
don&#39;t have the internship aslpect of it, but it seems that the description of <br/>
the time table and the evaluations and all of that...well, where&#39;s the joy in <br/>
THAT? Baking is joy for those of us that love it. Having a love become a <br/>
chore, or a project, removes that in my very honest opinion. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m excited for her! I hope she loves it - and if not, I hope she finds <br/>
another place, another thing, another passion. You sound very supportive of her and <br/>
that&#39;s wonderful. Just keep supporting HER and not the idea of the <br/>
internship, if that makes sense. <br/>

How cool :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-769532562">Thanks for the feedback Karen.  I will try to keep it a little looser.  My <br/>
daughter actually likes the idea of a structured framework for this.  She <br/>
wants the letter of recommendation and the evaluations, but keeping it lose <br/>
and fun is important to. She&#39;s got a laundry list of things she wants to <br/>
learn and experience, and as she decompresses from the rigid framework of <br/>
school she&#39;ll discover for herself what works and what doesn&#39;t.  She&#39;s also <br/>
interested in getting a part time job later this year and hopes the <br/>
internship will help her in that regard.  She&#39;s committed to the idea that <br/>
when she works, she wants to enjoy it, not tolerate it for the paycheck.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m more excited about this even than she is, but I keep my <br/>
enthusiasm in check because I don&#39;t want her to internalize my excitement <br/>
and feel she needs to satisfy my expectations.<br/>
