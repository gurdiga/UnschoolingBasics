gets evaluated. Unless you test at the end of the year, a certified <br/>
teacher must write an evaluation. They might use the portfolio <br/>
materials or they might not - an unschooler friendly evaluator might <br/>
just come over for lunch and talk with the kids for instance. <br/>
Sandra&#39;s website (sandradodd.com) has a link to unschooling and one <br/>
to Curriculum which includes samples of what other folks have done. <br/>
Lots of &quot;including but not limited to...&quot; type of language.<br/>
<br/>
Have you checked with local homeschoolers (and unschoolers)? They&#39;d <br/>
be the best resource for what your district is like.<br/>
