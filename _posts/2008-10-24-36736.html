<div id="ygrps-yiv-449715693">Just wanted to say thanks to Joyce and all the other moms who replied to my<br/>
email.  It will take me quite some time to go through all of the information<br/>
you provided, but I REALLY appreciate it!  All 3 of our boys will be<br/>
swimming in a swim meet tomorrow, so we are all off to bed to get enough<br/>
sleep.  I have slowly been trying to shift to unschooling principles and not<br/>
being the &quot;controlling&quot; mom.  I have to admit, I have always liked structure<br/>
and organization, but realize the importance of allowing my children freedom<br/>
to make their own choices.  I do not have anyone dictating a bedtime, hair<br/>
style or food choices to me so why did I think my children were not smart<br/>
enough to do that on their own? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for all of the information.  I still have lots of questions<br/>
and will definitely be asking away as soon as I sift through all of the<br/>
awesome info sent my way.<br/>
<br/>
You gals are awesome and SO inspiring!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
God bless, <br/>
