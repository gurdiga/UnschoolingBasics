<div id="ygrps-yiv-26243963">&quot;I still have &quot;workbooks&quot; and coloring books and etc on my<br/>
shelves........&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So do we! It&#39;s all the mindset though. If they hold no more power than<br/>
other books or fun objects, then by all means keep them.:)<br/>
My kids pull that stuff out on occasion (Sierra anyway) but there&#39;s<br/>
never a message that they need it or they should do that over anything<br/>
else they&#39;re interested in.<br/>
