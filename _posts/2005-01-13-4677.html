<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907835756">&quot;Anywho, just wondering about other experiences with little ones and<br/>
animals that I hadn&#39;t considered.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
RATS!!<br/>
Our rattie girls were well loved by all members of the family  <br/>
(we&#39;ve now lost all but one of them to old age). They&#39;re so smart <br/>
and loving, just like a miniature dog or something.<br/>
With a wee little one, you do have to be very present while they&#39;re <br/>
handling them, but even 2y.o. children adore rats and can cuddle and <br/>
hold them.<br/>
Jalen holds our last little rattie girl all the time. The only <br/>
problem is when he leaves her in his bed or in the clean laundry!! <br/>
So sweet, but not to be trusted on the chewing or pooping issues.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129778815">We have rats also.  They are very sweet. We had one litter and then  separted <br/>
male from female.  They love campany, very social.  My guys  are 4 and 12 and <br/>
they love them.<br/>
