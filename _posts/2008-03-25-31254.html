<div id="ygrps-yiv-740665474">Regarding punishment, I have two things to share that have made an impact on me:<br/>
   <br/>
  First is that when kids *feel* better, they *do* better.  Honestly, we can&#39;t expect our children to *feel* worse and *do* better!!!<br/>
   <br/>
  Second is looking at the long term.  Most parents would never say their long term goal for their child is to be fearful and compliant, and yet that&#39;s what punishment creates.  That and loss of trust between you and your child.  I like what Alfie Kohn says (Unconditional Parenting), that parents may think they are &#39;teaching them a lesson&#39; when in fact the child is experiencing withdrawal of love and loss of trust - *huge*!!!<br/>
   <br/>
  I have to say that I was very proud of myself this morning when I opened the bathroom door to my 3 year old twin girls sitting on the floor surrounded by reams and reams of unrolled toilet paper.  They were pretending to be gerbils making a nest, and they were full of joy.  Yay, that I didn&#39;t squash the joy!  And slightly-obsessive, clean-up-the-mess-now me, even left the paper there for them to play with later :).<br/>

handle when people read that and disagree? For example, my husband <br/>
was raised with punishment. When I ask him he says he never felt <br/>
unloved or fearful of withdrawal of love from his parents. He was <br/>
fearful of his dad&#39;s wrath but thinks that was part of a healthy <br/>
respect for his dad. My dad punished me and I was fearful of him. I <br/>
thought that was a bad thing then and now. However, I have always <br/>
respected and loved him more than my mother, who never punished me <br/>
but also didn&#39;t really pay any attention to me one way or the other. <br/>
My dad has always been the one person in my life I knew I could <br/>
always trust and count on in spite of being spanked by him on a <br/>
regular basis.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-361268744">How do you like it when someone criticizes you (respectfully  <br/>
discusses) for doing something that you already regret and know you  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have done?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you stay on the computer too long, reading email lists, and  <br/>
suddenly you realize that you&#39;ve run out of time to do something you  <br/>
said you&#39;d do for your husband. You feel bad about it. You know you  <br/>
should keep your word.<br/>
<br/>
He walks in the door and starts &quot;discussing&quot; it with you, trying to  <br/>
get across to you that it is important that you do what you say you&#39;ll  <br/>
do. You say you know that, but time just got away from you. He starts  <br/>
reiterating his points about how important it is and asks, &quot;Well, do  <br/>
you realize now that you need to pay more attention to what you&#39;re  <br/>
doing so this won&#39;t happen again?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you feel insulted? Don&#39;t you wish he&#39;d just shut up about it?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t tell kids things they already know. It is insulting. Remember  <br/>
that they (like all of us) know things that they may not always  <br/>
exemplify. They&#39;re LEARNING - they&#39;re are working on it. It is their  <br/>
life - let them work on it some without feeling like they&#39;re always  <br/>
being watched and corrected.<br/>
<br/>
Stop before you talk. Ask yourself, &quot;Am I about to tell him something  <br/>
new?&quot; If not, don&#39;t say it. Either he&#39;s not ready to understand it or  <br/>
he already knows it. Either way, repeating yourself is truly worse  <br/>
than useless, it makes it less and less likely your child will listen  <br/>
to your advice as he/she gets older.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 23 yo who openly says to me and others that she is SO lucky  <br/>
to have a mom who gives such great advice and how I&#39;m the first person  <br/>
she goes to for advice, etc. If she only KNEW how often I didn&#39;t give  <br/>
in to temptation to try to &quot;respectfully discuss&quot; something.<br/>
<br/>
I put that in quotes because it really can&#39;t be considered respectful  <br/>
discussion unless both parties are wanting to engage in it.<br/>

turning into Charlie Brown&#39;s Teacher (an old cartoon where the teacher&#39;s<br/>
voice was represented by a &quot;mwah, mwah, mwah&quot; sound) -- my friends aren&#39;t<br/>
often this informative with me :D (I tend to miss the cues)<br/>
I like to bring up situations to discuss when we&#39;re doing something totally<br/>
unrelated (i.e. driving- We love talking in the car!! or while baking some<br/>
goodies -- hard to get crabby when surrounded by delicious scents!), when<br/>
we&#39;re in the midst of calm and happy. Hayden (9.5) is lately receptive to<br/>
some guided imagery with me - we were headed out to a Bender Party (Yay<br/>
Futurama&#39;s back!!!) where he&#39;d be the only kid. I asked if he was gonna have<br/>
a good time, he said, I think so, I asked, Can you see yourself having a<br/>
good time? He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, smiled and said YEAH! --<br/>
and he did :)<br/>
It&#39;s imperative to remember &quot;Don&#39;t take it<br/>
personally&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.miguelruiz.com/fouragreements.html">http://www.miguelruiz.com/fouragreements.html</a>&gt;&quot;<br/>
in the moment (and in every moment for that matter ::bg::) -- he&#39;s sharing<br/>
*his* experience, it doesn&#39;t have to look anything like your experience...<br/>
If what your child is reflecting back at you is not what you&#39;re intending to<br/>
show them, change what you&#39;re showing them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-219165445">I have used punishment and withdrawal of privileges for years.  I have stopped doing all of these things, but I too have the need for the kids to go along with the day, without constant argument and negotiations.  I have 3 boys, 5,8 &13.  I see my mirror image in my 13 year old who I have to remind not to scold the kids, not to worry that they are being noisy, not to threaten them with loss of something.  YUCK!  I hate that I have taught him these behaviors.  I am hoping that my being steady and reliably open, supportive etc--not reverting back to old ways, that I will create NEW patterns for him too.  I wonder if there will be a shift within them in the next year or so, where maybe their need to argue and constantly negotiate the plans changes a bit  Maybe if they feel more validated and can trust me more, they won&#39;t have that need to butt heads.<br/>
<br/>
I am still learning new ways of dealing with negative behavior that they have, and trying to really breath thru those times when I feel frustrated and at a loss.  I tend to just try and hug them and kiss them and remind them how much I love them....seems like a pretty big shift happens then.  And saying yes as often as possible feels pretty good.  I will admit it feels like I am sneaking twinkies out of the house though...that ugly voice that asks me &quot;Is that ok to just play paintball all day?  Shouldn&#39;t he be DOING something educational?&quot;  Formal education is truly so indoctrinated in my being, that I have to have these little conversations with myself all day long.  Like a mother and child arguing together.  I hope that part of the path goes away, but I am an overthinker, so I wonder....<br/>

  Yah, pretty mixed feelings on this end too about what went on when I was a child.  My dad spanked me regularly too, and now I have huge trust and respect for him - but after working through all the anger and grieving about the choices he made back then.  My husband still thinks his childhood was &#39;fine&#39;.  He&#39;s just starting to see that his dad tried to shut down every emotion dh ever had.  My FIL tries to pull it now with my girls and boy, does he get shut down fast by me the momma bear!<br/>
   <br/>
  For dh, I really see that to come to an awareness of how it really was and how it really felt for him as a little kid to be shut down all the time would be hugely painful, and not something he&#39;s quickly jumping into with both feet.  That&#39;s why I think most people mainstream parent, because to do otherwise takes a lot of introspection and growing and moving through pain - at least that&#39;s what embracing RU has looked like for me.<br/>

either 1) he doesn&#39;t understand or 2) he&#39;s disobeying.<br/>
<br/>
It will help your relationship greatly to not assume either. Assume  <br/>
he understands but still needs help. Anticipate problems and redirect  <br/>
or whatever&#39;s appropriate to the situation. *Help* him. Be his partner.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s deliberately ignoring you, then it&#39;s something he really  <br/>
wants and you need to figure out a way he can have that or something  <br/>
that is just as good.<br/>
<br/>
Always treat them as though they&#39;re doing the best they can with the  <br/>
knowledge and skills and development they have. If you treat them  <br/>
like they&#39;re doing the best they can, they&#39;ll do better naturally. It  <br/>
may not come on your schedule but they will grow and change in  <br/>
healthy ways because you trust that they&#39;re capable.<br/>

was afraid it would sound like I was saying that punishment and <br/>
spanking was ok since so many went through it and say they are fine <br/>
now. I do not believe that at all and that was not my intent. Just <br/>
wanted to make that clear.<br/>
<br/>
I tell my husband those kinds of things. Why risk damage if you <br/>
don&#39;t have to? He doesn&#39;t get it because he sincerely can&#39;t see any <br/>
risk of damage, I guess.<br/>

so we weren&#39;t able to see them more than maybe twice a year. My MIL <br/>
died of cancer soon after we got married. Then we moved to HI and <br/>
lived there for 3 years and did not visit at all. My FIL got <br/>
remarried and he and his new wife came to visit us once. After we <br/>
came back to the continental US my FIL told us and his daughter and <br/>
her family that his new wife said she could not accept us (his <br/>
children) as part of their family and would not have anything to do <br/>
with us. He said that would not affect his relationship with us, <br/>
although I think it has. I don&#39;t see how it could not. We now live <br/>
in NC and FIL still lives in CT so we aren&#39;t close enough to see <br/>
each other often. We have not seen FIL or SIL and her family since <br/>
we first moved back here almost 2 years ago. My husband was deployed <br/>
for a year and I guess they didn&#39;t feel comfortable visiting us <br/>
without him here even though I invited them. I couldn&#39;t make the <br/>
long trip myself since I just had a baby in June. FIL was supposed <br/>
to come visit us two weeks ago but just got diagnosed with prostate <br/>
cancer and will be having surgery so I don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll see <br/>
him. So, lots of circumstances have just gotten in the way of us <br/>
seeing each other.<br/>
<br/>
I, personally, could not understand how a man who says he loves his <br/>
kids and grandkids could stay married to someone who said she could <br/>
not accept his children and grandchildren as part of her family but <br/>
he did. He said he was happy with his marriage and would not ever <br/>
consider divorcing his wife. I think my husband is good at blaming <br/>
the new wife rather than looking at his father&#39;s part in it. I don&#39;t <br/>
know how my dh can still feel loved after that but he says he does. <br/>

I am learning not to project onto my husband what I think he <br/>
*should* feel. I could tell how I think he should feel and what I <br/>
think that means in terms of his relationship with his parents but <br/>
that would just be supposition. I wasn&#39;t there. I&#39;m not in his head. <br/>
I only know what he tells me and I have to take that as his truth.<br/>
