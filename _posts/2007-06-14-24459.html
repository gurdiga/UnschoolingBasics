<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538131663">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Here I am, finding myself caught in the middle again.  DH just called <br/>
and wants the kids to go visit his parents, before we leave to spend <br/>
some time with mine.  His mom&#39;s birthday is today, and he wanted to <br/>
have the kids go tell her happy birthday.<br/>
<br/>
I know he&#39;s hurting, because the kids don&#39;t want a relationship with <br/>
his parents, but how do I make him understand that they are allowed <br/>
to have their own feelings, and that we really need to stand by our <br/>
kids?<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t tell him how they feel about his parents, because they <br/>
don&#39;t want to hurt his feelings, and because he is really good at <br/>
making them feel guilty.  I don&#39;t know how to approach this <br/>
situation, and hopefully get him to understand what the kids are <br/>
feeling.  He never had a relationship with either sets of his <br/>
grandparents, so why should he make the kids have one with his <br/>
parents?<br/>
<br/>
Any help on this subject would be greatly appreciated.  You guys have <br/>
all helped me and my family in so many different ways, especially <br/>
when it comes to seeing that the kids are learning, even if they paly <br/>
video games, or watch a movie, etc.  My kids are wonderful, sweet, <br/>
very loving kids who deserve to be treated good.  They just don&#39;t get <br/>
it from my in-laws.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833830212">Just a thought- does it have to be all or nothing. Can they go over for a hello and goodbye? call her? Send a card?

Have them talk together and discuss how it can happen that both parties feel okay with it. You do not have to &quot;have&quot; a relationship in order to say happy birthday- be polite, make it simple, make it work for everyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709695686">Julie,<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be all or nothing, I&#39;ve always told<br/>
them that their dad can take them over for a visit<br/>
anytime they want to go.  I did ask if they wanted to<br/>
call and tell their grandma happy birthday, and they<br/>
both said no.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have reached out to this set of grandparents,<br/>
wanting to spend time with them, yet it never happens.<br/>
 It hurts them to keep trying, and getting no where. <br/>
That&#39;s where my son said he has given them plenty of<br/>
chances and they blew it.  I won&#39;t force them to go<br/>
over, but they are free to call them, write to them,<br/>
or whatever, when they feel like it.<br/>
<br/>
They live right here in town, and they never call here<br/>
to just say hi, or anything like that.  My parents<br/>
will call long distance and talk to the kids all the<br/>
time.  It&#39;s just a difference in grandparents I guess.<br/>
 My parents are more hands on with the kids, and dh&#39;s<br/>
aren&#39;t, and barely want anything to do with them. <br/>
It&#39;s a shame on them, because I have two really great<br/>
kids, and they are really missing out on all of the<br/>
neat things that they do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just leaving it up to the kids, and what they feel<br/>
they would like to do.  I think they need some time to<br/>
heal from all of the stuff that happened between them<br/>
and my il&#39;s.  Once they heal, then if they want to let<br/>
their grandparents in, it will be up to them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406398177">How about you buy a card, they sign it and dad can drop it off? If I told my kids that it <br/>
would mean a lot to dad, they would do it for him, regardless of how they feel about <br/>
grandparents. Just an idea of compromise...<br/>
<br/>
As for &#39;making&#39; him understand, I don&#39;t think you can, any more than you could make your <br/>
children understand why grandma and grandpa are such old farts. If they get a guilt trip <br/>
whenever they tell him their feelings, then *I* would be the one telling him. I would say <br/>
&quot;DD doesn&#39;t want to talk to Grandma because last time grandma said x, y, and z, and that <br/>
was inappropriate. Grandparents should not treat kids like that.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Easier said than done, we only have one set of grandparents, who are relatively uninvolved <br/>
with the kids. They call and complain to me about our parenting choices, but when they <br/>
see the kids they are well-behaved. Although I&#39;ve been getting on to my dad about his <br/>
attitude lately. Talk about the sandwich generation!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
Melissa<br/>
