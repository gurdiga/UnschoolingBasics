<div id="ygrps-yiv-381826795">You guys are great. Tori is thrilled that people are wishing her <br/>
well when they don&#39;t even know her.  She&#39;s doing great, now if I can <br/>
just keep her from reinjuring herself until she heals.  Today she <br/>
wanted to take the dog for a walk and I had to remind her how hard <br/>
he pulls on the leash. Kids bounce back amazingly fast.  I on the <br/>
other hand, feel like I got hit by a truck.  It was all very scary <br/>
and we won&#39;t even go into the looks we got when I told them she <br/>
hadn&#39;t had a tetanus shot and needed one....or when Tori announced <br/>
to the Dr that she didn&#39;t do schoolwork when asked if she was <br/>
looking forward to school starting.  She did give all of them the <br/>
third degree before she&#39;d let them do anything to her.  I have to <br/>
give them credit for answering all of her questions and respecting <br/>
her right to ask. They even went out of their way to find <br/>
alternatives when she didn&#39;t want shots to numb her arm for <br/>
stitching and when she finally told them she&#39;d take the shots after <br/>
about 30 stitches, they didn&#39;t bat an eye. She was very brave,  <br/>
(unlike her mom) and somehow missed damaging any major arteries and <br/>
nerves.  Now if we can get through the next couple of weeks without <br/>
her trying to run on all fours I think she will heal just fine.<br/>
<br/>
More info than you needed but did want to thank you all for thinking <br/>
about us. <br/>
