<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094531753">Hi - My name is Ellen and I am hoping to homeschool my son (8) next <br/>
year (4th grade).  <br/>
<br/>
We are having some serious issues with the public school. My son has <br/>
ADHD & I don&#39;t feel they are capable of handling him properly. We&#39;ve <br/>
tried their 504 program & behavior modification programs & reward <br/>
programs & counsellors, etc and it just isn&#39;t working because he <br/>
doesn&#39;t fit into their type of schooling.<br/>
<br/>
I have requested the Home Study Packet from my state (Vermont) and I&#39;d <br/>
like to try unschooling him.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone give me an overview or a where to start type of thing?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
Ellen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-349408033">Hi Ellen and welcome. Have you read much about unschooling yet? Here&#39;s a good website to start with: www.sandradodd.com/unschooling<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about freeing yourself from all the trappings of school so you won&#39;t even need the Home Study package. You son is now free to learn at his own pace. He&#39;s free to rediscover his passions and talents. He&#39;s free. And you are free to remember him as his beautiful sweet self before school started labelling him.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote an article about my journey to unschooling with my son, now almost 17. You can find it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/special/mary">http://sandradodd.com/special/mary</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-566634478">Thank you, Mary.  The Home Study Packet has the paperwork I have to file with our State to home school. It tells me what is &quot;legally&quot; necessary.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for the link. I just hope I can do this as I&#39;ve never home schooled before but I just don&#39;t think the school is doing a good job.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-101070159">Hi Ellen, Welcome.  We are a new unschooling family(also in Vermont).  We pulled our 8yr <br/>
old Daughter out in Feb. .  We are deschooling, still,  and it is harder for me than her.  The <br/>
Sandra Dodd website that someone suggested really helps, so do all and any books by <br/>
John Holt, also the Teenage Liberation Handbook, and this group has been VERY important <br/>
for me.  Even when i don&#39;t post, or reply, just reading others posts help.  Either by making <br/>
me feel like i am not alone, or by answering ?&#39;s that i have, and everyone here is very <br/>
helpful!!  Good luck on your journey.  Melanie in Vt(mom to Lily 8, Grace and Emmett <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-932344947">Thank you, Melanie. I plan on having him finish this year since it takes three weeks to get homeschooling approved here after I submit the paperwork and that would put him into mid May wich is just about the end of the school year. I am looking forward to starting this but am still a bit at a loss as to exactly what I &quot;do&quot; in this process. I&#39;m going to use these next few months to try to understand that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919535022">Thanks for the suggestion. I was told to use &quot;broad&quot; terms like &quot;Topics of study may include but are not limited to.....&quot;  I know we have a few home schooled families in our area but I&#39;m not sure we have anyone that unschools.  I will have to check and see.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You CAN do this. Just relax. Think of this time right now as a vacation. You don&#39;t have to worry about keeping up or fitting in or being on schedule. Give yourselves permission to just be for awhile. Go rent some movies. Go to the park. Snuggle on the couch. Put on music and do a crazy dance. All is well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891291325">-Good luck, and it only took one whole week (7 days) to hear from the state, I was <br/>
amazed!!  The Unit study example in the packet is basically what we sent in, with <br/>
variations on what Lil was interested in.  Also the phrase &quot;may include, but may not be <br/>
limited to the following&quot; was in our curriculum a great deal.  Melanie-- In <br/>
