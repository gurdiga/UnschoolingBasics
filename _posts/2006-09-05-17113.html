<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338159719">So I posted a while back about the difficulties of trying to sleep during the day with two kids unschooling in the house. It has worked for years but has just lately started to get harder. Mostly because I am trying to do things right.<br/>
<br/>
When I try doing things right, try considering everyone&#39;s needs, try finding solutions everyone can enjoy...I just end up feeling a thousand times worse when I inevitably fail. <br/>
<br/>
Today:<br/>
6.5 year old comes upstairs to wake me to tell me that 11.5 year old will not play Sonic Heroes with him.<br/>
I have a brief interlude with him in which I attempt to explore the depth of his commitment to play said game. I come to the conclusion after talking to him for a few minutes that the reason he wants to play Sonic Heroes with his big brother is simply because his big brother does NOT want to...but I was willing to admit I could be projecting a bit...although he and I did talk about that and he (the 6.5 yr old) did agree that that was probably true.<br/>
I come downstairs to discover that a totally different game is in the console. That said game is in console and paused because big brother had gone to the bathroom after getting little brother through a hard part  in this other game at his request. <br/>
I sit on the floor with everyone. I talk about finding answers we are all happy with. I probe to see what everyone wants. I go to the bathroom and come back and they are playing checkers. Great!<br/>
No. They play checkers and I referee. 6.5 year old is learning about rules. Ok. 6.5 year old gets bored. Game over.<br/>
Okay. Now what does everyone want? Oh they start picking or something at each other and I lose it. I yell extremely loudly about trying to do the RIGHT THING here and couldn&#39;t they at least TRY to help me do that? <br/>
They stop bickering and stare in shame.<br/>
I lose track of events because now I am inwardly wallowing in remorse and shame.My favorite pass-time.<br/>
I ask again what anyone would like to do. Watch TV? Okay, big kid wants to watch TV so I send him up into my bedroom to watch TV--hell, it&#39;s not like I am SLEEPING up there, right?<br/>
HE starts crying. Why? I don&#39;t get it? Because I am yelling? I mean it, you really can go upstairs and watch TV and I really am trying not to yell and I am sorry.<br/>
Little brother has no idea what to do now. <br/>
Play Sonic. NO, play the one we don&#39;t have any more. Well, duh, I want to say, we don&#39;t have that one any more, we only rented that one!! But instead I try to get him set up with a game. He starts getting it ready, says he is fine to do it on his own and I go upstairs to try to go back to sleep (right...)<br/>
I get up there and even though the big kid is watching cartoons, I start crying myself to sleep. Except without the sleep. I wonder if unschooling or non-coercive parenting or consensual living is even remotely possible when one parent works 12 hour night shifts. Why bother? I rarely came upstairs and sobbed silently into my pillow when I would stomp down the steps to yell that I didn&#39;t care what they did, they just didn&#39;t need to wake me unless the house was on fire....and then they would find ways to entertain themselves all day.<br/>
<br/>
How can I convey that same urgency without being mean? How could I even think that I could be their partner if I feel that way about sleeping?<br/>
<br/>
But...before everyone goes and gives the most UNhelpful advice of all (change your schedule, quit your job blah blah blah)...<br/>
<br/>
How is this much different from a family in which the kids like to stay up at night and somebody has to sleep for work in the morning, or because they *have* to sleep or they are mean and crazy?!?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It seemed that my working the night shift was the best possible solution. We aren&#39;t that into voluntary poverty. Simplicity, yes to some extent. I stretch dollars. But we are buying a house, 2 vehicles and a heck of a lot of student loans. My mother lives with us and doesn&#39;t help with living expenses aside from food. I am a night person through and through. I work 3 nights a week and get to be here and available as needed, even if I am not at my finest. It feels right.<br/>
<br/>
I just wish there was a way to ease into this more. I try saying yes. I have gotten better at it.<br/>
<br/>
I forget to build up rather than tear down. I forget what is really important in these moments. Could one of you please monitor my audio feed and intervene as needed? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
DH likes to pose the idea that I have chosen this path just because it *is* so difficult in order to raise my ideals and set myself up for failure. I have wondered the same thing. I have been known to do so in the past. <br/>
<br/>
Please help. Is it unreasonable to tell them to let me sleep 3 days a week for a few uninterrupted hours providing they aren&#39;t really in need of my intervention? But who am I to say when they really need me? <br/>
<br/>
In theory, I don&#39;t mind waking up for every little thing. I want them to know they can trust me, that I am on their side.<br/>
<br/>
In practice I am a monster when I wake up. Fear me!  I discovered that about me when the oldest was a newborn--if my feet have to touch the floor I go into rage mode. So we did the family bed after a week of hysterical crying on my part because I hated myself for feeling such &#39;untoward&#39; feelings toward my newborn. That worked great for us! No more raging mommy, only well-rested rolling over in bed mommy!<br/>
<br/>
But they are older, this is daytime. They get bored. <br/>
<br/>
Last week I bought cool stuff for the 6.5 year old to do while I was sleeping. HE left the lids off the markers. He still complained. Okay-- I get it. What he needs apparently is ME. But I need to rest...or they need to wake up and get their mommy fix on before I go to sleep. I am just grumpy when I wake up. <br/>
<br/>
I could stay up. But then I lack the mental faculties to really do my best brainstorming. If they could plan ahead and know going into the day that they need to be in charge of the activities, then it might work better. <br/>
<br/>
There may be too many questions here, but I had to pour out my heart. I had a meltdown last week in the midst of PMS whose major recurring theme was something along the lines of &quot;@!%#$ unschooling, I don&#39;t need this baggage and shame!!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I really am a perfectly reasonable and logical person who understands USing in theory in so many levels. But I fail in practice.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I get more than ONE response this time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When our children were little and being their night-owlish selves (my girls<br/>
usually go to bed between midnight and 3am) one of us was awake with them.<br/>
Now my girls are older and they understand that there are others in the<br/>
house that have a need to sleep.  They cook, play games, role play, read,<br/>
watch movies, surf, chat with their night-owlish friends.  They keep it to a<br/>
dull roar and keep it to the back of the house where they know they won&#39;t<br/>
wake people up.<br/>
<br/>
How is this different from your situation?  Your children (at least your<br/>
6yo) are younger and still need a mindful parent.  How are you being a<br/>
mindful parent if you are only wanting sleep and for them to leave you<br/>
alone?<br/>
<br/>
While you may find this to be UNhelpful, I think that it is important to<br/>
look at your job and how it is impacting your family.  Is there *no* way in<br/>
which you could change your job so that you can be more participating than<br/>
yelling and sobbing and sleeping during the times it is evident that they<br/>
need you?  Can you get your mother in on this?  Where is the other parent?<br/>
They still need you and they are trying to tell you that.  It sounds like<br/>
they don&#39;t have the skills needed in order to play quietly by themselves so<br/>
you can rest.  Obviously what is happening now isn&#39;t working, so something<br/>
needs to change.  Which is easier to move?  Muhammad or the mountain?  Which<br/>
are you going to be?  You have *chosen* to work at night because it works<br/>
best for *you* but what works best for your family as a whole?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**It&#39;s tough to operate without sleep. Kids have meltdowns when they are too <br/>
tired and so do adults. It is important for you to work out a sleep schedule <br/>
and still be available to your children. Maybe you could sit down with the <br/>
kids (when you&#39;re not angry or tired) and ask for their help in coming up <br/>
with ideas so that you can get some sleep and still be there for them. Maybe <br/>
working together on a schedule or having a system of some sort (that THEY <br/>
are involved in creating) so that they can respect your needs and still get <br/>
what they need from you (and it really sounds like the kids all need you <br/>
more than they are getting right now). They might surprise you with the <br/>
ideas they have and with how well they respect the plan they come up with.<br/>
<br/>
**There was a discussion a while back (I think it was on this forum) about a <br/>
difficult father at home all the time when the mom was trying to unschool <br/>
and the kids and mom had to walk on eggshells all day or get yelled at, he <br/>
didn&#39;t like their behavior and really didn&#39;t sound like his relationship was <br/>
very strong with anyone in the home. Some people thought that school would <br/>
be a better environment for these kids than the alternative in their home. <br/>
I&#39;m not in your home so I&#39;m not sure other than from these posts but it <br/>
sounds like there is hardly any REAL interaction between you and the kids <br/>
when you are trying to get your sleep. I wonder how you might have handled <br/>
all this in your past &quot;traditional&quot; ways. Are you saying that you would <br/>
usually just tell them to not wake you unless the house was on fire and <br/>
leave them to themselves? How much do you think THEY got out of these old <br/>
interactions? How much did YOU get out of these interactions? They might get <br/>
more out of being in a school of some sort if the alternative is to be at <br/>
home with only their siblings and no real quality time with a parent to help <br/>
them throughout their day. This is one of the reasons why I&#39;m not so keen on <br/>
a Sudbury type school since there is no constant parental availability and <br/>
opportunity for interaction. Again, I&#39;m not in your home to tell for sure <br/>
(you know best), but are these days when you are recovering from work really <br/>
enriching your relationship with your kids?<br/>
<br/>
**Finally, I don&#39;t know that anyone here on the list will have an ultimate <br/>
solution that&#39;s right for you. I do think that many people will offer up <br/>
some questions that you might want to ask yourself (if you haven&#39;t already). <br/>
Maybe there will be a few little suggestions here and there but I think you <br/>
already know that to make it work you&#39;re going to probably need to make some <br/>
changes (either in work schedule, sleep schedule, etc.). I hope you find the <br/>
&quot;answers&quot; you&#39;re seeking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677512172">Hello Mary,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m totally new to unschooling so I cannot give any professional  <br/>
advice. First of all, I liked your post! :-) I like your writing  <br/>
style :-) Just as a side note.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you should quit your job. Sometimes this just doesn&#39;t  <br/>
work. I mean, really try to see if there are any options with the  <br/>
job, changing schedules etc – but if there are not, then this is  <br/>
really unhelpful.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, they need you, but for how many hours are you asking? You said  <br/>
&quot;a few hours&quot;, so I&#39;ll presume 2? 3? maximum 4? 5 would be already  <br/>
more than half a night&#39;s sleep so it&#39;s not &quot;a few&quot;. I&#39;m positive that  <br/>
there is some creative way out there  for your sleep. I used to not  <br/>
want children just because I knew I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep through  <br/>
the first year or more!!! So I can totally understand your need :-)<br/>
<br/>
In Scott Noelle&#39;s first (free) Podcast, he talks about the words  <br/>
&quot;needs&quot; vs. &quot;desire&quot;, this may be helpful, you might want to check it  <br/>
out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.enjoyparenting.com/dgn/intro">http://www.enjoyparenting.com/dgn/intro</a><br/>
<br/>
Maybe it helps talking to them when you are not angry about sleep,  <br/>
about how everyone needs and wants it, and about why you need to do  <br/>
it during the day.Today, my dd (7) wanted me to buy a game, but we  <br/>
can&#39;t buy it yet, we need to get the second half of the money we get  <br/>
each month, only we get it in the middle of it. She knew that we had  <br/>
gotten money recently and when I said, we can&#39;t buy it now, we have  <br/>
to wait a week, she didn&#39;t understand. Normally I would have just  <br/>
said &quot;no&quot; and not explained anything. But  recently she discovered my  <br/>
calculator and has been playing around with it and having fun. So  <br/>
(now that we are unschooling and I&#39;m explaining the real nos) I took  <br/>
it and showed her how much income we have (we have a detailed list),  <br/>
and how much we have to spend, and when we get all that money and  <br/>
when we have to spend it. For her it was really &quot;Aha&quot; and she really  <br/>
apreciated that I took the time and explained all of that and she  <br/>
accepted the no, because of truely understanding the conditions,  <br/>
which is only fair.  I mean REALLY talking, explaining everything,  <br/>
not just half of the truth, but also why you chose to work at nights  <br/>
(to be able to be with them during the day – (ask yourself: is the  <br/>
reason why you are doing this really happening or are you rather only  <br/>
sleeping during the days? Maybe it would be easier then for them if  <br/>
you jsut worked during the day and they wouldn&#39;t have you at all -  <br/>
but this is just a side note and not trying to tell you to quit the  <br/>
job. Just in case the outcome is the same as if you just worked  <br/>
during the day, you might better just do that then!)). Why you need  <br/>
to do so (money, and why, how much is really needed and so on), why  <br/>
your husband cannot stay at home (more income maybe or whatever the  <br/>
reason) and so on... If your 11 yr old understands better than your 6  <br/>
yr old, he might want to help you out with this problem. Maybe both  <br/>
understand very well! Maybe your son would agree Babysitting for a  <br/>
while or so? And since the question about giving your children money  <br/>
arised here recently and I read that some unschoolers let their kids  <br/>
do some jobs for money – maybe you like the idea of having your son  <br/>
do this (although I don&#39;t really like that idea... well I dunno yet,  <br/>
I haven&#39;t thought about it thoughtfully yet), but just in case you  <br/>
have been thinking of hiring a babysitter, maybe his brother would be  <br/>
better and you are still available anyway in case of emergency.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is.. maybe you can move the TV somewhere else, so you  <br/>
don&#39;t have to let them watch in your bedroom – or you could sleep  <br/>
somewhere else? Guest room? mother&#39;s room? kids room? So at least  <br/>
this part :<br/>
<br/>
&quot;hell, it&#39;s not like I am SLEEPING up there, right?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
of your annoyment would vanish :-) So at least, if at some point they  <br/>
really choose to watch TV while you sleep, you wont get interrupted  <br/>
by the TV.<br/>
<br/>
Hm what else... maybe they need more input on what they could really  <br/>
do with that time! Maybe you could collect things during the week  <br/>
which could be interesting (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strewing">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a> & http:// <br/>
sandradodd.com/BoredNoMore) and hand them out on these days, so there  <br/>
is something fun and new to do?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would work if they could at least be with you, even if you  <br/>
sleep, so it would be get the TV, the console, the games the books  <br/>
the magazines and the toys TO your bedroom, ... or get yourself to  <br/>
the kids room and you are there, but sleeping, and they are with you?  <br/>
When my daughter was younger, i found that it really helped to at  <br/>
least doze while she was playing. But I could be still be right there  <br/>
if she needed me. Maybe they would even be respectful and quiet while  <br/>
you sleep and maybe that would be boring after a while anyway and  <br/>
they could go somewhere else. And maybe, just as with every limits  <br/>
you set – the more there is limited mom, the more they want her. So  <br/>
maybe being available somehow although you sleep would help. This  <br/>
would require you not to yell and be angry though, or else it is not  <br/>
really a choice. Advice about hot not to yell and be angry gives  <br/>
Scott Noelle again :-D I found his texts very helpful at least.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea is maybe not to go to sleep at a special bedtime on  <br/>
these three days, but to go to bed when you feel they are into  <br/>
something now (maybe you already do this!). Like when people tell  <br/>
young parents to sleep when their baby is asleep (instead of trying  <br/>
to condition the baby to sleep when the *parent* needs to sleep). So  <br/>
you are there for them *first* and as soon as you see they are hooked  <br/>
up into something and won&#39;t need you for a while, you can say what  <br/>
you are going to do now &quot;I want to sleep now – if anyone wants to  <br/>
sleep with me, feel free to join&quot;, that sounds better then putting an  <br/>
expectation in it: &quot;I really need to sleep now, so just DON&#39;T wake me  <br/>
up, OK?&quot; That already tells your children you are expecting them to  <br/>
wake you up anyway. And check out what Scott says about &quot;needing&quot;  <br/>
something, I found it interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I remember on some homepage of unschooling parents I read that  <br/>
sometimes they would plan the day in the morning so that everybody  <br/>
could get things done. i tried that here and it was good especially  <br/>
when I was planning to get my needs met as well. So everyone has to  <br/>
say what he wants to do, and then you&#39;ll try to schedule it a bit, so  <br/>
that it fits best. So 6yerold wants to go to the museum, watch Movie  <br/>
X, read book Y and eat cookies and 11yr bring the books back to the  <br/>
library, also watch Movie X now that you mentioned it, play game Y  <br/>
and chek emails, you want to  get the laundry done, read your  <br/>
newspaper, call XY and sleep. So you can then try to schedule it  <br/>
like: First we&#39;ll go to the museum and on the way home we can go to  <br/>
the library and deliver the books, we can buy something cookies, go  <br/>
home, while you read book Y with 6yr old, 11yr could play game Y and  <br/>
when they watch the movie together you could sleep meanwhile. So  <br/>
everybodies wishes is respected and they know from the beginning that  <br/>
a) their needs will be respected even though you want to sleep b) you  <br/>
will want to sleep sometime c) what to do while you sleep. I guess  <br/>
schedules are not really &quot;unschooling&quot;, but if you keep it flexible  <br/>
and don&#39;t force them to do the things they had planned until they  <br/>
changed their minds... it could work :-)<br/>
<br/>
And also, don&#39;t think that in &quot;normal&quot; schooled families, the parents  <br/>
are never frustrated like you are now :-) I often cried because it  <br/>
&quot;didn&#39;t work&quot; in this or the other way. So this should not be the  <br/>
reason why you stop unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and this: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Efetteroll/rejoycing/">http://home.earthlink.net/%7Efetteroll/rejoycing/</a> <br/>
commitments%20obligation%20responsi/haveto.html may be applied to  <br/>
your problem as well..  (and maybe the other responses on &quot;respect&quot;  <br/>
on her website)<br/>
<br/>
What is your job btw? How is your exact schedule? And how is the  <br/>
schedule of your husband and of your mom? Maybe there are other  <br/>
creative ways to get some more sleep!<br/>
<br/>
Johanna<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: if I gave any unappropriate advice which is really not  <br/>
unschooling, please tell me, so I can learn :-)<br/>

<br/>
One thing though, about this:<br/>
<br/>
***Please help. Is it unreasonable to tell them to let me sleep 3 days a <br/>
week for a<br/>
few uninterrupted hours providing they aren&#39;t really in need of my <br/>
intervention?<br/>
But who am I to say when they really need me?***<br/>
<br/>
How many hours sleep do you need?   If it&#39;s only five or six hours, three <br/>
days a week would it be possible for you to have a teen helper or an adult <br/>
friend over to play with your kids while you sleep?   Maybe you could work <br/>
out some kind of trade with another mom.    Maybe your big kid could stay <br/>
home and your little kid could go to play at a friends house?<br/>
<br/>
***But...before everyone goes and gives the most UNhelpful advice***<br/>
***I hope I get more than ONE response this time.***<br/>
<br/>
People might offer more ideas you if seemed interested in listening.   ; )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386487329">I really need advice on how to deal with my youngest daughter&#39;s temper. <br/>
Kenzie is 7 years old and is a ball of energy. The problem is when her <br/>
older sister, Kayla, doesn&#39;t want to do what Kenzie wants (like play <br/>
dolls or a board game). She refuses to play by herself. <br/>
<br/>
She explodes and starts saying the most hateful things or starts crying <br/>
as loud as she possibly can. She also does this with me if I can&#39;t give <br/>
her whatever it is she wants immediately - out in public or at home. <br/>
I&#39;m at a loss as to how to deal with this. Reasoning doesn&#39;t <br/>
help....much of the time it seems to make it worse.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421243432">My concern would be why is she doing this? I can imagine that reasoning <br/>
doesn&#39;t work. The solution doesn&#39;t lay in fixing the end result, but in the <br/>
reason behind it. Maybe she needs more things to do? Does she get much <br/>
physical play? She might have trouble explaining her own actions to you or <br/>
even understanding it herself. The fact that it comes and goes says to me it <br/>
isn&#39;t likely a brain problem.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter was like this for a while. We didn&#39;t punish or even react <br/>
much to her directly when it happened. We starting seeing that when she had <br/>
more things to do to release her energy both physically and vocally, she <br/>
stopped. We also gave her lots of extra love. It may be as simple as a <br/>
reassuring pat on the back or some one on one time with us.<br/>
<br/>
Does she see you or other adults express emotions? It&#39;s important that she <br/>
see&#39;s that emotions are normal and expressible. I am a yelling person. Not <br/>
just in anger, but I am loud in a lot of things. As time has passed I saw <br/>
that my children understood loud was okay no matter what they were doing, <br/>
but they didn&#39;t have a good understanding of how being loud affected people <br/>
around them. As we have all grown, we have learned to use our loud voice as <br/>
needed, but also see that it was a freedom to be loud, not a license to <br/>
scream. Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Much Love,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-605358676">She doesn&#39;t want to go outside very often since we&#39;ve recently moved <br/>
(about 2.5 months ago) because there is only one little girl who <br/>
lives on the street and she is never outside. She used to play <br/>
outside all the time when there were other kids to play with. Right <br/>
now the girls are outside playing in the water hose. :)<br/>
<br/>
I try to pick up new, interesting things for them to explore and play <br/>
with as finances allow. We go to the library often, run errands, and <br/>
go to the park or the beach (when the heat is not so extreme). They <br/>
help me bake cookies. We watch movies together. They play on the <br/>
computer.<br/>
<br/>
The main conflict happens when Kenzie wants to play with Kayla and <br/>
Kayla doesn&#39;t want to at that moment.<br/>
