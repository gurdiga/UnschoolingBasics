<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489267998">I got onto a list for our local homeschool group thinking it would give us<br/>
an opportunity to meet other kids with like interests.<br/>
 I got an email last night saying the monthly meeting would be tues. at 6:00<br/>
 There would be babysitters and we needed to let her know so she could know<br/>
how many teens to get.<br/>
 There is going to be a man coming that is a teacher at our community<br/>
college and he is sharing that there is an opportunity for the teens in<br/>
public and homeschool to participate. Trips to nashville to the capitol,<br/>
seeing a law come into being and voting on it etc. He had wanted my teen<br/>
there ( he is a friend of ours) so i thought I could take the kids and have<br/>
them sit with me so Zach could hear the talk and choose for himself.<br/>
  I emailed asking the leader if it was ok to bring them in with me and have<br/>
them occupied with things quietly.<br/>
 Her response was: if you bring kids there are babysitters. Just let me know<br/>
how many you are bringing.<br/>
  I don&#39;t understand homeschool groups that ban children. Why? Am I looking<br/>
at this from the wrong point of view? I am at home to be with my kids...why<br/>
leave them so I can go talk about being at home?<br/>
 Doesn&#39;t make sense to me. And the kids would not have access to me if they<br/>
needed me.<br/>

<br/>
It sounds normal but doesn&#39;t immediately sound like Unschoolers. It sounds<br/>
like a school-at-home activity and support group. They are intending to be<br/>
discussing &quot;business&quot;, and that the kids might be distracting or<br/>
disinterested in the talking heads. They are assuming that mothers would<br/>
like a bit of a break from their kids. Maybe the teen sitters are really<br/>
cool and your younger ones would have a really good time. <br/>
<br/>
If you all like any of the field trips then you could go on them. Is<br/>
attending this monthly meeting mandatory if you want to engage in other<br/>
activities or park days with the group?<br/>
<br/>
How do they propose to &quot;prevent&quot; your child from coming to you or calling<br/>
you if they need you? If this idea is actually the philosophy behind the<br/>
group it may not be a good fit for someone who is parenting mindfully. Have<br/>
you talked to any of the other members, than the host, kind of checking the<br/>
references of the sitters?<br/>

This is actualy funny because there is a local homeschooling group here that I have been debating whether to get involved with and every month I get invited to the meetings and I never seem to be able to go but last month we specifically didn&#39;t go because of the same kind of thing.  From the sound of it, kids were not welcome.  So I called and said &quot;of course, it&#39;s ok to bring the children-right?&quot;  And the lady in charge said &quot;well maybe we could find a babysitter if someone needed it but really it&#39;s better if you can come without them.&quot;  And when I explained that I really thought I&#39;d like the children&#39;s input on the trips and stuff (it was a field trip planning type meeting) and that I&#39;d like them to come along with me if at all possible, she again offered to find a teen to come and watch them for me so that I could participate.  I was baffled and I didn&#39;t go.<br/>
 <br/>
Next week is another party and I think thankfully something came up because suddenly I feel I have so very little in common with school-at-home homeschoolers that I don&#39;t know how it will go.  So we won&#39;t go next week but next month, they&#39;re going to the observatory which I know my son is interested in so my plan is to participate sort of from afar until I figure it all out.<br/>
 <br/>
So to answer your question-I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; but I&#39;ve seen it happen.  It&#39;s mind blowing to me really.  lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628060136">Yes, this sounds normal....and I&#39;ve been on both sides of it. I&#39;ve had<br/>
children that didn&#39;t leave my side and I run a local homeschool group. What<br/>
we do is have teens and/or moms available in a nearby room with crafts and<br/>
games. Kids always have the option of going with the teens or staying with<br/>
Mom....I just can&#39;t imagine telling a child or parent that they can only<br/>
come if they leave their child. On the other hand, the reason I provide the<br/>
activities is that our meetings are quite frankly boring for kids.....we<br/>
don&#39;t usually have speakers, but we have sharing of information and always<br/>
have Q & A time.....and I can&#39;t speak over 20 loud children.  When we&#39;ve not<br/>
been able to procure help with the kids, we&#39;ve had way too much noise, lots<br/>
of running around and horsing around...from both structured homeschool kids<br/>
and unschooling kids (these are parenting issues, not homeschooling<br/>
issues)....so I try to offer a pleasant alternative for the kids. The kids<br/>
that want to stay with mom are usually young or don&#39;t mind sitting still if<br/>
that&#39;s what it takes to be near Mom.  And mind you, I don&#39;t expect silent<br/>
children sitting with their hands in their lap (a rather frightening idea,<br/>
actually), I have a high tolerance to noise and chaos.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-524003433">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list.  Not new to unschooling though. :)<br/>
Started before ds1 was born.<br/>
<br/>
I have ds, 8, ds, 4 and dd, 13mo.<br/>
<br/>
We recently joined a group of homeschoolers because<br/>
they were AP, since we are very AP.  Ok, let&#39;s see how<br/>
this goes.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re having the same thing happen.  &quot;crafts&quot; and<br/>
&quot;activities&quot; planned by the moms.  my ds, 4, got really<br/>
upset when they insisted on &quot;following the directions.&quot;<br/>
And the moms all talk about curriculum and lessons,<br/>
sigh.  This has been my experience with most groups<br/>
I have tried.  Even joined an AP Homeschooling list and<br/>
they mostly talk about &quot;schooling&quot; stuff. sigh...<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I started my own list for APing Unschoolers.  Now<br/>
to build enough interest locally to have our own APing<br/>
Unschoolers to get together with. :))  Ahh, but unschoolers<br/>
are one fickle bunch, everyone following their path.  So,<br/>
getting together for a &quot;meeting&quot; is kind of an antithesis<br/>
of the whole meeting thing. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185629712">We had a nice little  homeschool group until a couple of the dads went to<br/>
some weekend fundamentalist get-together that told them to get more involved<br/>
wiht their kids&#39; homeschooling.  So... they came to our group (their wives<br/>
sitting meekly by their sides), and told us that from now on the meetings<br/>
would be in the evenings when they could be there, and that we  needed to<br/>
get babysitters for our kids - not to bring them along.  I was livid.<br/>
Everyone else was afraid to speak up.  We left the group.  Isn&#39;t being with<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Normal, yes.<br/>
if you&#39;re not comfortable, don&#39;t do it. Maybe not right for you or the <br/>
right time of life for you.<br/>
<br/>
But I do think there are times it is useful for adults to get together <br/>
to talk without distraction and sometimes people don&#39;t seem to use good <br/>
sense about how disruptive their own kids are going to be. I bet <br/>
they&#39;ve had problems with that, and that&#39;s why they set up the teens <br/>
watching over the younger kids and why they don&#39;t want the children in <br/>
the adult talk.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving kids in order to talk about being at home? I think it makes <br/>
some sense to do that. For a couple of years, I gave talks on a <br/>
scheduled basis to those who are interested in getting started <br/>
homeschooling - when people had their children with them it very very <br/>
definitely reduced the amount they learned from the talks and also <br/>
reduced the amount other people at the talks could learn. I did it <br/>
anyway - because the talks were the hour before our regularly-scheduled <br/>
park day and so it made sense for them to have their children with them <br/>
- but I can most definitely say that it was distracting and made a <br/>
significant difference in how in-depth we were able to get. I did these <br/>
talks at a park, so the kids could play on the playground right next to <br/>
where the talk was going on, and often that was fine, the kids were <br/>
busy and happy. But other times the kids were very much in evidence and <br/>
very distracting. It was worth it - the timing was good, the atmosphere <br/>
informal and encouraging to parents of young kids. But, definitely I <br/>
can see how the opportunity to talk without the distractions of kids <br/>
would be beneficial, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230059937">Pam,<br/>
 I do understand your point of view. I can see that getting started would<br/>
need more one on one.I feel that this is passed that and is now become<br/>
common place for the Moms to get their time. There are parent&#39;s night outs<br/>
and stuff.<br/>
  It is just the feeling I get from the Moms at times. Not all of them but I<br/>
do hear comments like..&quot;I just had to get away for awhile.&quot; or &quot; the kids<br/>
were driving me crazy&quot; and everyone else nods their heads and seems to agree<br/>
or understand.<br/>
 My concern is with the kids...they must hear that sometimes and how do they<br/>
feel?<br/>
anyway....I don&#39;t think it is right for us and we will keep plodding along.<br/>
We have recently met a family that homeschools and the kids seem to fit<br/>
nicely. <br/>
