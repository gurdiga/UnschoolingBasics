<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922662357">&quot;  I really couldn&#39;t figure out the saw in the <br/>
front of the picture...what WAS it doing there? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was the interest they decided to hone in on for Sierra. They asked<br/>
each of my kids to pick one of their favorite activities to be<br/>
represented in the pic. It felt very unnatural posing like that of<br/>
course, but that&#39;s their call.<br/>
<br/>
He actually had her using the saw for several pics, it was SO loud. I<br/>
kept saying &quot;she could just act like she&#39;s using it!&quot; but I think he<br/>
really was fascinated with a 9y.o. girl that could handle a compound<br/>
miter saw like a pro.<br/>
<br/>
After he got sawdust on his camera lense, he decided to stop asking<br/>
her to cut with the thing!! I was thinking &quot;I told you so.....&quot;;)<br/>
<br/>
The background is actually not our property. We&#39;re standing in our<br/>
yard with a vacant lot behind us. Our backyard was actually much<br/>
prettier imo!  Maybe they wanted a wilder look....I dunno.<br/>
