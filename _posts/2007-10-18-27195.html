<div id="ygrps-yiv-788810323">This is one of the areas I have trouble switching to full radical<br/>
unschooling on.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are pretty young.  7 and nearly 4 and I also babysit a 3 year old.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like all my kids want to eat is Ramen Noodles.  I try and make<br/>
different things that I think they will like or make different things<br/>
because I nearly hate Ramen Noodles.  I know what you are going to say, &quot;let<br/>
them eat Ramen Noodles&quot;, right?  To be honest, I feel like I don&#39;t have the<br/>
energy to be a short order cook.  I  don&#39;t want to make 5 different meals at<br/>
every meal time.  I know I need a change in perspective, so &quot;feed me&quot;<br/>
ladies, lol!<br/>
<br/>
Also, my youngest (nearly 4) tries to be quite controling and we can&#39;t<br/>
figure out why that is.  She tried to tell people that they have to or can&#39;t<br/>
do things, especially her older sister.  I would like to think that we let<br/>
her have enough control over her choices that she doesn&#39;t need to be<br/>
controling.  Is it her age?  Is it that we should be giving her less choices<br/>
(sometimes I think things are easier for her if she DOESN&#39;T have to make the<br/>
choices)?  I should also mention that I believe she borders along the lines<br/>
of having Sensory Integration Dysfunction, but have not had her tested or<br/>
anything.  It mostly affects her hearing.  She can&#39;t handle loud noises.<br/>
She also has what appear to be &quot;anger issues&quot;.  When things don&#39;t go her way<br/>
she gets really hot tempered and used to hit, bite and pinch others, but has<br/>
now directed it to blankets, pillows, etc.  After taking her off Red dye the<br/>
&quot;anger issues&quot; got better but the SID stuff got worse.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351787863">I&#39;ts not a whole bunch of meals - a big pot of ramen for them and <br/>
whatever you want for you - 2 things. And ramen is hot water and a <br/>
packet of stuff (unless they&#39;re in the eat-ramen-raw stage, I&#39;ve <br/>
known folks that do that...bleh) so it shouldn&#39;t take much more <br/>
effort than boiling water (get an electric kettle if you don&#39;t have <br/>
one, they&#39;re wonderful and you can do 2 or 3 cups of water for ramen <br/>
at a time).<br/>
<br/>
What is it about the ramen they like? The crunchy noodly things? The <br/>
salty broth? What other things are similar? Are there &#39;better&#39; <br/>
quality ramen packets you can find (less sodium for instance)? Have <br/>
you tried putting the ramen next to an assortment of crackers and <br/>
crisp veggies and maybe some ranch dip for the veggies? Add to it <br/>
rather than take away what they like. Sure, they may only eat the <br/>
ramen and leave the veggies, but it&#39;s there for them, it&#39;s not <br/>
either/or, it&#39;s this AND that too! <br/>
<br/>
You might also keep a food diary of everything that passes their <br/>
little lips - water, juice, milk, ramen, every morsel. Then after a <br/>
month look back at it. You might be surprised (I read an article by <br/>
a pediatrician mom who did this and was VERY surprised - she thought <br/>
her kids were living on macaroni alone). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871046687">When I was pregnant with my oldest and on a *very* restricted budget,<br/>
I found a ramen that had no MSG or animal broth... The brand was Ty<br/>
Ling, and it was their original flavor. I haven&#39;t seen it in years. It<br/>
was more expensive than other ramen - 3/$1 instead of 10/$1 - but<br/>
worth it to me! I&#39;d add a few frozen veggies and stir in a beaten egg<br/>
for a semi-egg drop soup. Yummy!<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100941663">That sound yummy (well, yummier) to me, but they won&#39;t eat anything that is<br/>
mixed like that.  No casseroles or anything.  Everything has to be seperated<br/>
out on their plates, lol!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-693252262"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I  don&#39;t want to make 5 different meals at<br/>
&gt; every meal time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can the 7yo make his(?) own - in the microwave, perhaps? I didn&#39;t <br/>
even own a microwave until a year ago, but it has been a wonderful <br/>
tool for the kids, my stepson, especially. He makes Ramen in the <br/>
microwave almost daily. <br/>
<br/>
Something else to consider is having an abundance of quick and easy <br/>
snack options available all throughout the day. That takes a lot of <br/>
pressure off the idea of &quot;meals&quot;. George and I love to eat together, <br/>
and often have two or three meals together a day, but the kids <br/>
aren&#39;t expected to join us. Since there&#39;s always food available, <br/>
there&#39;s no implication of &quot;eat what we&#39;re having or go hungry&quot;. They <br/>
can join us (and often do) either to eat or simply to socialize. <br/>
<br/>
The snacks we have are a mix of nutritious home-made goodies, bite <br/>
size fruits and assorted starchy things that are easy to eat by the <br/>
handful - not any harder to make sure that kind of thing is on-hand <br/>
and easy to grab than making a meal.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;What is it about the ramen they like? The crunchy noodly things? The salty<br/>
broth?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There is MSG (monosodium glutamate) in some brands of ramen noodles and<br/>
loads of other things, and it makes foods taste really good.  It&#39;s<br/>
addicting.  It&#39;s in a lot of things and the label won&#39;t often indicate that<br/>
it&#39;s MSG.  It&#39;s often hidden under other names.  Here are a couple of links<br/>
about it.<br/>
