<div id="ygrps-yiv-269317333">Here, let me expound.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has dark auburn hair so we had to bleach it.<br/>
After bleaching it, I used a paint brush and painted the hair<br/>
henna on making sure I got it all.(pre-mixed from Henna king)<br/>
My daughter has extremely thick long hair so it took like six tubes.<br/>
<br/>
When the roots would grow in, I&#39;d bleach just the new hair growth<br/>
then henna&#39;d them.  The Henna intensifies with the more you put on<br/>
and it lasts for months.  <br/>
<br/>
First she went neon pink.  It was so pink that a wild macaw spotted <br/>
her and came to visit.  Her hair was so brillant that she could be spotted<br/>
over three quarters of a mile away.  No joke. Actual measured distance.<br/>

<br/>
Later she wanted to add other colors so I blended it from pink to deep <br/>
purple to black on the under layers.   <br/>

<br/>
When she finally tired of the bright hair, we bleached it once again (the pink returned some <br/>
so she looked like Naruto, lol) Then we colored it as close to her natural color and dread locked it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It took me eight hours just to section it all before I started dreading.  So be forwarned, it&#39;s a big<br/>
process but she looked cute and got lots of compliments from other dreadheads+.  When she tired<br/>
of dreads, she cut them out and is now sporting an adorable short do, ready to start her professional<br/>
training as a Firefighter.  (She can&#39;t have &#39;fun&#39; hair while in the Academy.<br/>

The BEST for natural, pure, body art quality henna that is amazing on <br/>
your hair.  TONS of info including history, geographical sources, tons <br/>
of photos, use of indigo and cassia mixes, etc.  A wonderful resource <br/>
for henna people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047701639">Thank you Kendrah,<br/>
Yes, it takes a brave soul to go that brilliant.  I couldn&#39;t do it.<br/>
She was still in ps with over 3000 students when she went pink.<br/>
Needless to say, she turned heads everywhere.  The most precious<br/>
was all the little girls who would openly stare and smile.  My daughter<br/>
always took the time to smile and wave back.<br/>

Her hair is beautiful. Thanks so much for attaching a picture. I <br/>
would love to do a color like that someday. I&#39;m not quite bold enough <br/>
to do all my hair, but maybe dye it blonde (currently it is brown) <br/>
and do the tips in neon pink! Fun.<br/>
<br/>
Kendrah:)<br/>
