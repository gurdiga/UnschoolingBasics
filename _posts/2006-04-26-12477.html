<div id="ygrps-yiv-268451299">Hello!<br/>
I&#39;d like to ask what lessons you have for me on the issue of freedom<br/>
as compared with permissiveness.  I really dislike that word<br/>
(permissiveness), but I can&#39;t think of any other way to describe what<br/>
I&#39;m trying to say.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I ask is because I come to this notion of unschooling from<br/>
a very traditional place but grew up in a very permissive environment.<br/>
 It felt a little like respect and a lot like &quot;you&#39;re on your own&quot;<br/>
which left me ill prepared for some of life&#39;s simple realities.<br/>
I wanted better boundaries and more parental input (structure?)<br/>
<br/>
Is there a lot of agreement on things like chores (none) or are those<br/>
with more structured unschooling environments just more quiet? <br/>
<br/>
I am on other lists where most are self described &quot;radical<br/>
unschoolers&quot;  Do most on this list characterize themselves the same<br/>
way and what is the difference between an unschooler and a radical<br/>
unschooler?  I would be so grateful if everyone could share a little<br/>
of their thinking with me.<br/>
<br/>
I know these questions rank about as high as &quot;but how will you<br/>
socialize your homeschooler&quot; for which I apologize :-) but someone<br/>
wrote to me &quot;as unschooling settles in your heart&quot; and I am very very<br/>
close, just these few remaining concerns...<br/>
<br/>
I thank you so much for your thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Cynthia</div>

<br/>
Well, we know you didn&#39;t come from an unschooling home because you <br/>
would not have felt all &quot;on your own.&quot; We loook at it as a partnership. <br/>
I&#39;m here to help my sons and support them, whatever their interests. <br/>
There&#39;s a LOT of repect. Chances are you were in school, so even *that* <br/>
esteemed place of higher learning &lt;cough, sputter&gt; didn&#39;t prepare you <br/>
for &quot;life&#39;s simple realities.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are natural boundaries out there. You find them as you explore. <br/>
Parental input is not the same thing as structure.<br/>

<br/>
The loudest of us &lt;g&gt; aren&#39;t chore-givers. We work together to make the <br/>
household run. We help each other and we realize that different things <br/>
are important to different people.<br/>
<br/>
Julie&#39;s family has chores, but they aren&#39;t set up as <br/>
&quot;you-do-the-things-on-this-list-or-else&quot;---they have a working farm <br/>
with lists of things that must be done each day. They&#39;ve come to a <br/>
concensus as to how everything will be accomplished each day. It&#39;s <br/>
flexible and caters to each others&#39; strengths.<br/>
<br/>
Structure doesn&#39;t mean chores or no chores. I have a lot of structure <br/>
to my day/week/month/year. It&#39;s the way *I* work best. But I don&#39;t <br/>
enforce *my* way on my sons.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to get away from chores---see what it&#39;s like on this side <br/>
of the fence---we can help you get there.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am on other lists where most are self described &quot;radical<br/>

way and what is the difference between an unschooler and a radical<br/>
unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The owners and moderators are all radical unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Most of this list? I&#39;d say *most* are beginners! &lt;bwg&gt; I&#39;d guess 90% <br/>
(totally made up stat) of the few loudmouths are radicals.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think *any* of us would characterize ourselves in the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Basic difference is that the unschooler sees everything as <br/>
educational---snakes and lemon cookies and computers and mud puddles <br/>
and right angles and clocks and legos and music boxes and Goethe---all <br/>
equally educational.<br/>
<br/>
We radicals extend that learning to bedtimes and eating and hygiene and <br/>
chores---radicals see *EVERYTHING* as learning. We see how children as <br/>
VERY capable in all parts of life and living. We want our children to <br/>
trust that they can learn *anything* if they want to---not just the <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774419998">Thanks so much for your reply, kbcdlovejoy!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been all over the unschooling blog ring and it really helped me<br/>
to see the way unschoolers live &quot;it&quot;!!  <br/>
<br/>
I am most interested in exploring your comments about *you* having<br/>
structure but not requiring it of your kids.   That is mostly where I<br/>
ran into trouble... I follow a Penelope Leach model of parenting...<br/>
respect, love, understanding... and in observing and understanding<br/>
(and trying everything under the sun) I have found that structure is<br/>
very necessary for my ds&#39;s happiness - in our current configuration-<br/>
and worried that choosing unschooling meant giving up on the hopes of<br/>
providing my children with structure under which they flourish. <br/>

This is how we&#39;ve always done things so I sorta felt as if I was being<br/>
asked to go FURTHER beyond our highly liberal parenting ways or give<br/>
up the idea of being an unschooler.<br/>
I can see now we may just already be there on a lot of fronts and<br/>
thats why the concept of unschooling clicked with us. <br/>

 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Then you&#39;re misunderstanding the whole concept of unschooling. It <br/>
means giving the children what they need. And each child is different.<br/>
<br/>
  But I think it&#39;s important NOT to think you know what your child <br/>
needs! She can tell you. Maybe not now, but you should be able to take <br/>
her cues. She&#39;ll let you know when she&#39;s had enough or when something&#39;s <br/>
too much or not enough.<br/>
<br/>
  I think a child who craves structure (like me) will develop that <br/>
herself. If you see her struggling, you could help her tweak what she&#39;s <br/>
already doing---or show her an alternative. The biggest problem is <br/>
making sure it&#39;s HER initiative, not *yours*!!!<br/>
<br/>
  A lot of parents think their children need structure, when in reality, <br/>
it&#39;s the parent that does. If the mom&#39;s structure slides, the mom <br/>
freaks out and starts making the children toe the line so that she can <br/>
get things back in *her* order.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Structure&quot; (in education circles) often means curriculum. In <br/>
Unschooling, it means a plan to the hour/day/week/month/year/whatever. <br/>
Some children really do need to know what&#39;s going to happen next and <br/>
next and next. But in unschooling, they DON&#39;T need to know that math is <br/>
at 9:00 and history at 10:00. They need to know they are going to the <br/>
park at 10:00, lunch at 12:30 (and where), the grocery at 2:00, and <br/>
legos from 3:30 until supper. It&#39;s a different KIND of structure from <br/>
the school model. We don&#39;t need to structure their *learning*, just <br/>
help structure their days for them. Their learning happens as that side <br/>
effect.<br/>
<br/>
  *I* need structure to get all my list done in one day (been sliding <br/>
soooo much lately---too many irons in the fire! Makes me feel <br/>
powerless. Need to stop, breathe, refocus!). But I DON&#39;T need to <br/>
structure my learning. I learn while I&#39;m doing all the things on my <br/>
lists. (Yes, that&#39;s plural---I have several all going at once! &lt;bwg&gt;).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 This is how we operate exactly... communication and understanding and<br/>
 operating on &quot;Principles not Rules&quot; - sorry can&#39;t cite that - too<br/>

  Well, we DO tend to ask you to go further! &lt;g&gt; I figure I can always <br/>
be a better parent, better spouse, better person. Just because I get <br/>
it, doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t keep working towards a bigger, better goal.<br/>
<br/>
  If your child NEEDS structure, help her find it, develop it, channel <br/>
it. Just be sure it&#39;s HER structure and not yours imposed on her.<br/>

have a learning curve.  <br/>
I would like to think that this is an open board where we can come to<br/>
learn, be challenged and think, but not to be talked down to.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think it behooves the transmission of this life changing (world<br/>
changing) philosophy to treat the learners as if they were not already<br/>
parents!  I have had the joy of being a parent for 10 years.  I&#39;m darn<br/>
good at it.  Our family has open loving communication.  We too can<br/>
still learn, grow and improve, but all too often on this board I see<br/>
the arrogance of the &quot;experts&quot; and I find that to be highly ironic.<br/>

I didn&#39;t mean it as a smack-down at all!<br/>

What I was trying (miserably, obviously) to say was that, if you <br/>
thought unschoolers couldn&#39;t structure things, you misunderstood what <br/>
we try really hard to get across: each person, especially each CHILD, <br/>
is unique. It&#39;s our job as parents is to find what works for each <br/>
child---especialy if that child is not like us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631267109">Well, first I would want to thank Kelly for her reply and say Yes,<br/>
there is no doubt that you have far more successes than otherwise!  I<br/>
thank you.  And Ren, I thank you and all the others very, very much<br/>
for your time and service to the newbies.  <br/>
<br/>
I see now I came across as too &quot;violent&quot; in my assertion that there is<br/>
a certain tone of arrogance taken with some posts.  But I thought long<br/>
and hard about posting because if I had said nothing, I would&#39;ve<br/>
simply left, and unfortunately I know that I am not the only one who<br/>
is frustrated with a perception of a tone.  If I am wrong, then I am<br/>
wrong.  <br/>
I think answering queries posed is kind, helpful, and I am grateful<br/>
you are willing to do it.  But as you all challenge us newbies on<br/>
their perceptions... maybe there is something to my words. <br/>
Again, I thank you.  And I wish you continued success!<br/>

&gt; I see now I came across as too &quot;violent&quot; in my assertion that there is<br/>
&gt; a certain tone of arrogance taken with some posts.  But I thought long<br/>
&gt; and hard about posting because if I had said nothing, I would&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; simply left, and unfortunately I know that I am not the only one who<br/>
&gt; is frustrated with a perception of a tone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tone is what you make of it.  There is no &quot;tone&quot; in most posts as we have no<br/>
way of reading sarcasm, query or challenge into the words posted.  Our own<br/>
tone enfluences how posts will be read.  :)  I was very recently kicked off<br/>
(or rather asked to leave and then moderated) from an e-mail list for<br/>
homeschoolers.  It was for a group across the border.  I joined it because<br/>
it was the only list for that are, a place we were considering moving and<br/>
because Dan works there and I thought we might join them for some of the<br/>
(really cool) activities that they do since it isn&#39;t that far of a drive.<br/>
We&#39;ve done a few things with them, but not much just because of the friggin&#39;<br/>
gas prices (you can intone that anyway you want :) )  For the past year or<br/>
so whenever a new person would sign on the list with their &quot;Hello, I&#39;m new<br/>
to all this homeschooling and dont&#39; even know where to begin.  Help me.&quot;<br/>
posts, I would offer information about unschooling.  Never the &quot;Oh this is<br/>
the ONLY way to homeschool and if you don&#39;t do it this way then you are a<br/>
dolt.&quot;  But simply, &quot;I have found that unschooling has really worked well<br/>
for our family.  We love the freedom to learn as and what we want.  For more<br/>
information you can write me off-list or visit this website.&quot;  *Everytime* I<br/>
would post something like that the owner would jump in and go &quot;Warning:<br/>
Unschooling is NOT the only way to homeschool.  Please look into ALL the<br/>
different ways of homeschooling before you select one.&quot;  And yes; she would<br/>
use the word &quot;warning.&quot;  What I found ironic about the whole situation is<br/>
that she claimed that she was going to use the &quot;Classical&quot; or &quot;Trivium&quot;<br/>
approach with her children (3 under the age of 5 - so not even &quot;starting<br/>
homeschool&quot; yet.)  When I asked once if she could tell me more about this<br/>
style of learning she said that she really didn&#39;t know much, but that it was<br/>
the education that her husband was raised with in some Eastern European<br/>
country and he thought it was best.  Hello?!??!?!  She is going to teach her<br/>
children using a style she knows very little about but she tells other<br/>
people to do their homework on homeschooling.  Yeah.  Well.  I rarely posted<br/>
personal posts on that list and usually only posted &quot;informational&quot; posts.<br/>
I wasn&#39;t looking to that list for support in our unschooling, just looking<br/>
for people to hang out with.  Very scary people to hang out with.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
What I have found in doing work with interpersonal communication skills is<br/>
that people who have doubts about the way that they are doing something will<br/>
tend to read what other people say as confrontational. They may be<br/>
questioning something that they have done or did something that they felt<br/>
wasn&#39;t the right thing, but when they read that verification (that what they<br/>
did may not be right) they find that they have to justify their actions and<br/>
any information, both positive and negative, is seen as a challenge.  I know<br/>
this list is good for questioning what people are doing by asking lots of<br/>
questions and for some people that can be seen as a challenge to the way<br/>
they are currently doing things and it makes them feel like they have to<br/>
defend it or prove why the suggestions won&#39;t work for them.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that it felt good to get kicked off that list.  It validated,<br/>
for me, the things that I thought about most of these women.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about that, but if they visit here<br/>
looking to learn more about unschooling, they<br/>
most definitely will do so.  The main premise to<br/>
this seems to me that it&#39;s all about, to the<br/>
extent possible, honoring the needs of every<br/>
member of your family in every situation. <br/>
Equally.  Whatever those needs may be.<br/>
<br/>
And I personally want the people to whom I go for<br/>
advice to be confident in their own choices.  I<br/>
believe that that means they believe that their<br/>
choice is the absolute BEST choice for THEIR<br/>
families.  I believe that I have to honor my<br/>
individual instincts & intelligence to help me<br/>
make decisions for my own family.  <br/>
<br/>
I have joined & left a number of other<br/>
homeschooling boards because they were so<br/>
abrasive that I just couldn&#39;t understand how they<br/>
could be that way online every day and still<br/>
manage to be gentle & tolerant with their<br/>
families.  I didn&#39;t like the feeling I got while<br/>
I read the posts, many of which seemed<br/>
offens-ive, petty & often irrelevant, or so I<br/>
thought.  Either way, they weren&#39;t for me.  I<br/>
joined and stayed with this group because the<br/>
parents here are, in fact, honest, gentle &<br/>
tolerant while being well-read, well-informed,<br/>
well-practiced, wise, walk-the-walk type of<br/>
UNSCHOOLING parents.  I mentioned to dh the other<br/>
day that I&#39;m amazed at how much help & support I<br/>
get from a bunch of people I&#39;ll likely never<br/>
meet.  Don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do with out y&#39;all.<br/>

seen people get jumped on for aspects that are outside the strict <br/>
realm of unschooling, too.  The forms of discipline (and by <br/>
discipline, btw, I&#39;m not necessarily referring to punishment) have <br/>
been touted as &quot;this is the only way&quot; -- not in so many words, of <br/>
course, but the implication has been there.  My son, imo, has always <br/>
been incredibly easy to raise, but I know there are some children <br/>
that are much more challenging to guide.  So, because x,y, and z <br/>
worked well for us, doesn&#39;t mean it will work best for you, or Susy <br/>

should fix the problem&quot; or &quot;This is how you should discipline.&quot;  What I see<br/>
on this list is not how to fix problems but how to look at things from your<br/>
child&#39;s point of view and how an unschooling family would approach a<br/>
problem.  Are we asking the &quot;hard questions&quot; or perhaps answering with<br/>
questions that are fearful to approach.  Sometimes treading in new territory<br/>
can be difficult when the mainstream media is SO LOUD about what is<br/>
&quot;right.&quot;  It took me a while to be able to drown out mainstream media so I<br/>
could listen to my children.  :)<br/>

<br/>
No, it doesn&#39;t. Maybe you could be more specific. If you want to get<br/>
into children that are &quot;challenging&quot; or more intense, I could give you<br/>
an earful. I think you actually need to really notch up the respect,<br/>
gentleness and kindness when dealing with intense behaviors!!<br/>
<br/>
I think the EXACT SAME principles are important for EVERY child.<br/>
Respect, kindness, generosity, peace, joy and gentleness are something<br/>
every child needs and deserves no matter what. HOW that plays out when<br/>
dealing with challenges will look different from situation to situation.<br/>
The principles are the same.<br/>
The philosophy is the same.<br/>
<br/>
What we discuss here is how to work as a PARTNER with your child. What<br/>
we discuss is how to help learning unfold in your home in a natural<br/>
manner. What we discuss is how to respect children and their choices<br/>
on every level. That&#39;s what we&#39;re here to discuss...how to GET to<br/>
unschooling (or dig deeper).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all learning and growing constantly. But some of us have found a<br/>
  very deep and abiding confidence in unschooling and in living<br/>
respectfully with our children. We only want to share what has worked<br/>
and what is detrimental. This list was created specifically for that<br/>
purpose. To deter from that purpose would be disrespectful to all the<br/>
folks that signed up here to GET that from the list.<br/>
<br/>
My confidence and ability to speak about unschooling does not mean I&#39;m<br/>
not also digging deeper and learning more as I walk this<br/>
journey...believe me!! Just now, I walked into my bedroom with a pile<br/>
of nachos and Jalen says &quot;MOM, you can&#39;t eat in your room!!&quot; (I&#39;ve<br/>
asked everyone not to bring food in my room since I can&#39;t STAND it in<br/>
my bed and all over the floor).<br/>
I looked at him funny and he says &quot;well, YOU said it!&quot;<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re right buddy, thanks for reminding me&quot; I answered.<br/>
We went and ate them together at the table and Markus says &quot;He has no<br/>
tolerance for hypocrisy&quot;.  &quot;)<br/>
<br/>
So true. Jalen reminded me tonight, that respect means that I don&#39;t<br/>
ask something of them that I wouldn&#39;t do myself!! duh. I love that<br/>
they won&#39;t let me get away with that crap....they keep me true.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But some of what I have read here is what I have gathered to <br/>
be &quot;radical unschooling&quot; vs &quot;unschooling&quot; (based on some definitions <br/>
I&#39;ve read on this list.)  I thought &quot;generic unschooling&quot; (okay, so <br/>
there isn&#39;t a good term to differentiate, I guess) is ditch the <br/>
curriculum (unless the child wants it), and allowing them to learn, <br/>
follow interests, etc.  Setting guidelines in other areas of their <br/>
lives, that effect the rest of the family, or not, even, but still <br/>
allowing them to learn the things they chose to -- is that not a <br/>
form of unschooling?  <br/>
<br/>
For instance, food/health issues.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose someone has a diabetic child (I don&#39;t, but have known <br/>
some.)  Child decides that they don&#39;t care about the consequences, <br/>
they aren&#39;t going to do testing, will eat whatever, and will not <br/>
take insulin.  This isn&#39;t a matter of respect but health and <br/>
maturity.  We cannot expect a young child to be mature, to make <br/>
mature decisions, and in this example, it would have disasterous <br/>
consequences to respet the child&#39;s choices.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have never had a problem with people sharing what worked or was <br/>
detrimental for their family -- but please, remember that what works <br/>
and what is negative for your family, may not be what works or is <br/>
negative for all families.  The devil is in the details -- and your <br/>
family doubtless has different personalities, interests, needs, than <br/>
my family.  And than Mary&#39;s.  Or ...  <br/>
<br/>
I truly do respect that you have found that going &quot;whole hog&quot; has <br/>
worked wonderfully for your family, and that you are passionate <br/>
about it.  (I tend to be passionate about things, too, in case ya <br/>
didn&#39;t notice. ;-))  But cannot we have some common middle ground <br/>
that allows us to acknowledge that there are many ways to do things, <br/>
even unschooling?  And that, perhaps, some people may need to take <br/>
it a step at a time for their own family&#39;s well-being? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-983792011">&quot;We cannot expect a young child to be mature, to make<br/>
mature decisions, and in this example, it would have disasterous<br/>
consequences to respet the child&#39;s choices.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have never, ever read a post that tells anyone to ignore a very real<br/>
medical need!! If there is a REAL reason to impose something, then by<br/>
all means do it. But it can still be done with respect to what that<br/>
person wants, meeting their underlying needs.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re in a partnership with your child, then all issues/challenges<br/>
are going to be handled AS a partnership rather than top-down<br/>
management style.  Of course children don&#39;t have the same experience<br/>
and maturity that an adult does. Of course we are supposed to keep<br/>
them safe from harm. But a child wants to stay safe from harm too!<br/>
They don&#39;t always know how, nor understand consequences but if treated<br/>
as intelligent capable human beings, they will surprise you with their<br/>
ability at a very young age.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody here is advocating a free-for-all. Nobody is saying &quot;let your<br/>
child do whatever they want, regardless of the consequences&quot; yet that<br/>
seems to be the message some folks are getting. <br/>
<br/>
Arbitrary rules are silly. Principles help us live by a &quot;code&quot;, a code<br/>
that can apply in a variety of situations. My bedroom is shared by my<br/>
children but I don&#39;t like food in it. They understand that. That<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean we have a rule that says &quot;You can never eat in a bedroom&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When they want to watch tv in Sierra&#39;s room, they bring food in. When<br/>
she doesn&#39;t want mess in her room, we try to bring in mats or<br/>
something to meet both needs.....food with tv AND lack of food on her<br/>
floor.:) The goal is to strive to meet everyone&#39;s needs, not lay down<br/>
some arbitrary rule. There are still codes of conduct, guidelines,<br/>
basic principles of treating each other well and personal boundaries.<br/>
Heck, call it a rule. But our &quot;rules&quot; are mostly up for discussion<br/>
because they center around what each of us prefers. The only ones I<br/>
can think of that I wouldn&#39;t be willing to fudge on, are things like<br/>
&quot;no smoking in my house&quot;....not really an issue around here though.:)<br/>
<br/>
Balance. That&#39;s what it&#39;s really all about. Balance and respect.<br/>

Thank you, Deborah for stating this so eloquently.  I&#39;ve had so many  <br/>
occasions of late where people have been saying &quot;children are resilient&quot;, and I  am <br/>
left thinking to myself &quot;well, mine aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

experience to understand that cars can kill them.<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean the only answer is to limit and control the child?<br/>
<br/>
Turn your thinking around from protecting them to being their  <br/>
partner. Toddlers may want to run into the street but they also want  <br/>
to stay alive! Helping a child doesn&#39;t mean letting them run into  <br/>
danger just because that&#39;s the direction they&#39;re headed with sparkles  <br/>
in their eyes. But the other choice isn&#39;t being a roadblock.<br/>
<br/>
We can offer something better.<br/>
<br/>
We can stay away from busy streets until a child can understand.<br/>
<br/>
And we can give them a dose of information as we&#39;re steering them clear.<br/>
<br/>
Same with deadly peanut allergies.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a lot more useful to ask how unschoolers handle a potentially  <br/>
life threatening situation than to say &quot;No, can&#39;t, our situation  <br/>
isn&#39;t average so we need to control.&quot;<br/>

Stories of the resilient warm our hearts. And I think most of us <br/>
subconciously cling to them because otherwise we would be overwhelmed by the tragedy of <br/>
the billions of damaging things to happen to children every day, all over the <br/>
world, right next door, and in our own homes and families.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407762208">Ren this is so true.  Inasmuch as possible and on an ongoing basis...<br/>
to know yourself and what you&#39;re about (that&#39;s the principle) says<br/>
volumes to the child.  This works with everybody, including adults. <br/>
That way the possibility of getting drawn into someone&#39;s drama ...<br/>
their struggles ... is not so likely.  In other words, people who have<br/>
a fairly accurate sense of themselves remain steady.  Not distant<br/>
(unless they need to be for self-preservation from abuse) but they are<br/>
themselves not who/what others think they are.  And so that<br/>
transference of the child&#39;s own issues from self to parent doesn&#39;t<br/>
happen.  With support and empathy (relating not identifying with) for<br/>
the child, the parent can simply be --- a bulwark when needed in the<br/>
storms of life rather than a barometer.<br/>
