<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496655900">Hi Karen.  There is something somewhere and I will try to find it when I get<br/>
the chance.  If you don&#39;t hear back just bump this thread up to the top<br/>
again and somebody who knows will probably give you the link(s).<br/>

I&#39;m sure there is a place on line that tells how to do this but I&#39;ll be<br/>

should<br/>

<br/>
By law, we have to keep one in SC.<br/>
<br/>
The first two years, mine looked very scrapbook-y. Since then, they <br/>
*could* look scrapbook-y IF I put them together. Instead, I just <br/>
collect everything in a large tupperware-type box. That way I can pull <br/>
it together in just a few days if I ever need to. And if I don&#39;t, it&#39;s <br/>
much more accessible if it&#39;s not all &quot;glued down&quot; in a scrapbook. I <br/>
keep that tupperware box next to the back door. I stuff everything we <br/>
collect into it---playbills, brochures, flyers, ticket stubs, artwork <br/>
(not the GOOD stuff, but examples and minor things---the good stuff <br/>
gets framed/displayed), photos, library lists,...whatever is relevant <br/>
to our homeschooling lives.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron&#39;s *final* box would have photos of a lot of things we/he did, <br/>
brochures of places we went, playbills of performances we attended, <br/>
copies of poems he&#39;s written, articles about him or BY him in <br/>
newspapers/magazines, a list of books he&#39;s read, examples (or photos) <br/>
of his art, DVDs of the movies he&#39;s made, CDs of music he&#39;s recorded, <br/>
trips he&#39;s taken---both in the US and abroad, letters of recommendation <br/>
from jobs he&#39;s held---basically anything of interest in his life.<br/>
<br/>
His resumes are tailored to the job---college application too---&#39;cause <br/>
not everything is applicable to every situation.<br/>
<br/>
You *don&#39;t* need to have a bunch of tests. &lt;g&gt; A real life counts for a <br/>
LOT! &lt;g&gt; You just need to be able to &quot;translate&quot; it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-302755784">That&#39;s kind of what I thought.  Thanks!  My boys are about to turn 10<br/>
and 12 so I wanted to begin collecting things and putting them into<br/>
some kind of order now.  If not for any real purpose but to get into<br/>
the habit.  Thanks so much!<br/>
