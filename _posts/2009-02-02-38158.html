<div id="ygrps-yiv-809250495">I just received this poem in my email from my local homeschooling <br/>
group.  The ladies there think this is SO right on about teenagers.  <br/>
As I read it, I found I had a much different opinion and it made me <br/>
glad I raised MY teenagers differently.  Now I&#39;m thinking about re-<br/>
writing this with a more positive and unschooling frame of mind.  I <br/>
gotta be responsible and finish my January paperwork before I <br/>
indulge, so if anyone would like to give it a shot, feel free to jump <br/>
in.  I&#39;d love to read a MUCH more positive spin.<br/>

DON&#39;T MESS WITH MOM <br/>
<br/>
My son came home from school one day,<br/>
with a smirk upon his face.<br/>
He decided he was smart enough,<br/>
to put me in my place.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Guess what I learned in Civics Two,<br/>
that&#39;s taught by Mr. Wright?<br/>
It&#39;s all about the laws today,<br/>
The &#39;Children&#39;s Bill of Rights.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
It says I need not clean my room,<br/>
don&#39;t have to cut my hair<br/>
No one can tell me what to think,<br/>
or speak, or what to wear.<br/>
<br/>
I have freedom from religion,<br/>
and regardless what you say,<br/>
I don&#39;t have to bow my head d,<br/>
and I sure don&#39;t have to pray.<br/>
<br/>
I can wear earrings if I want,<br/>
and pierce my tongue & nose.<br/>
I can read & watch just what I like,<br/>
get tattoos from head to toe.<br/>
<br/>
And if you ever spank me,<br/>
I&#39;ll charge you with a crime.<br/>
I&#39;ll back up all my charges,<br/>
with the marks on my behind.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you ever touch me,<br/>
my body&#39;s only for my use,<br/>
not for your hugs and kisses,<br/>
that&#39;s just more child abuse.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t preach about your morals,<br/>
like your Mama did to you.<br/>
That&#39;s nothing more than mind control,<br/>
And it&#39;s illegal too!<br/>
<br/>
Mom, I have these children&#39;s rights,<br/>
so you can&#39;t influence me,<br/>
or I&#39;ll call Children&#39;s Services Division,<br/>
better known as C.S.D.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course my first instinct was<br/>
to toss him out the door.<br/>
But the chance to teach him a lesson<br/>
made me think a little more.<br/>
<br/>
I mulled it over carefully,<br/>
I couldn&#39;t let this go.<br/>
A smile crept upon my face,<br/>
he&#39;s messing with a pro.<br/>
<br/>
Next day I took him shopping<br/>
at the local Goodwill Store.<br/>
I told him, &quot;Pick out all you want,<br/>
there&#39;s shirts & pants galore.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve called and checked with C.S.D.<br/>
who said they didn&#39;t care<br/>
if I bought you K-Mart shoes<br/>
instead of those Nike Airs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve canceled that appointment<br/>
to take your driver&#39;s test.<br/>
The C.S.D. is unconcerned<br/>
so I&#39;ll decide what&#39;s best.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;No time to stop and eat,<br/>
or pick up stuff to munch.<br/>
And tomorrow you can start to learn<br/>
to make your own sack lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Just save the raging appetite,<br/>
and wait till dinner time.<br/>
We&#39;re having liver and onions,<br/>
a favorite dish of mine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He asked &quot;Can I please rent a movie,<br/>
to watch on my VCR?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Sorry, but I sold your TV,<br/>
for new tires on my car.<br/>
<br/>
I also rented out your room,<br/>
you&#39;ll take the couch instead.<br/>
The C.S.D. requires<br/>
just a roof over your head.<br/>
<br/>
Your clothing won&#39;t be trendy now,<br/>
I&#39;ll choose what we eat. <br/>
That allowance that you used to get,<br/>
will buy me something neat.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m selling off your jet ski,<br/>
dirt-bike & roller blades.<br/>
Check out the &#39;Parents Bill of Rights&#39;,<br/>
It&#39;s in effect today!<br/>
<br/>
Hey hot shot, are you crying,<br/>
Why are you on your knees?<br/>
Are you asking God to help you out,<br/>
instead of C.S.D..?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Send to all people that have teenagers or have already raised <br/>
teenagers, or have children who will soon be teenagers or those who <br/>
will be parents someday OR ANYONE WHO&#39;D JUST GET A LAUGH ...I love <br/>
this One!!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081511753">Ah, I think you have to consider the time in history when Dumas was  <br/>
writing (mid-1800&#39;s). He was referring to men (generally being the  <br/>
word for people of consequence i.e. not women) and comparing educated  <br/>
adults to children. Slamming the educational establishment, more like.  <br/>
As his writing is of a time, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s bitching about men,  <br/>
specifically.<br/>

I was in college in the late 90&#39;s and used &quot;her&quot; in writing because for my purpose I envisioned a woman and my professor marked off for it.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675107207">This reminds me of the mom song on You Tube- that one annoys me too. Its all about the endless nagging most children have to endure and it makes me feel so sorry for some kids (and husbands!)<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Don&#39;t mess with mom poem<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just received this poem in my email from my local homeschooling <br/>
group.  The ladies there think this is SO right on about teenagers. <br/>
As I read it, I found I had a much different opinion and it made me <br/>
glad I raised MY teenagers differently.  Now I&#39;m thinking about re-<br/>
writing this with a more positive and unschooling frame of mind.  I <br/>
gotta be responsible and finish my January paperwork before I <br/>
indulge, so if anyone would like to give it a shot, feel free to jump <br/>
in.  I&#39;d love to read a MUCH more positive spin.<br/>

<br/>
DON&#39;T MESS WITH MOM <br/>
<br/>
My son came home from school one day,<br/>
with a smirk upon his face.<br/>
He decided he was smart enough,<br/>
to put me in my place.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Guess what I learned in Civics Two,<br/>
that&#39;s taught by Mr. Wright?<br/>
It&#39;s all about the laws today,<br/>
The &#39;Children&#39;s Bill of Rights.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
It says I need not clean my room,<br/>
don&#39;t have to cut my hair<br/>
No one can tell me what to think,<br/>
or speak, or what to wear.<br/>
<br/>
I have freedom from religion,<br/>
and regardless what you say,<br/>
I don&#39;t have to bow my head d,<br/>
and I sure don&#39;t have to pray.<br/>
<br/>
I can wear earrings if I want,<br/>
and pierce my tongue & nose.<br/>
I can read & watch just what I like,<br/>
get tattoos from head to toe.<br/>
<br/>
And if you ever spank me,<br/>
I&#39;ll charge you with a crime.<br/>
I&#39;ll back up all my charges,<br/>
with the marks on my behind.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you ever touch me,<br/>
my body&#39;s only for my use,<br/>
not for your hugs and kisses,<br/>
that&#39;s just more child abuse.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t preach about your morals,<br/>
like your Mama did to you.<br/>
That&#39;s nothing more than mind control,<br/>
And it&#39;s illegal too!<br/>
<br/>
Mom, I have these children&#39;s rights,<br/>
so you can&#39;t influence me,<br/>
or I&#39;ll call Children&#39;s Services Division,<br/>
better known as C.S.D.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course my first instinct was<br/>
to toss him out the door.<br/>
But the chance to teach him a lesson<br/>
made me think a little more.<br/>
<br/>
I mulled it over carefully,<br/>
I couldn&#39;t let this go.<br/>
A smile crept upon my face,<br/>
he&#39;s messing with a pro.<br/>
<br/>
Next day I took him shopping<br/>
at the local Goodwill Store.<br/>
I told him, &quot;Pick out all you want,<br/>
there&#39;s shirts & pants galore.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve called and checked with C.S.D.<br/>
who said they didn&#39;t care<br/>
if I bought you K-Mart shoes<br/>
instead of those Nike Airs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve canceled that appointment<br/>
to take your driver&#39;s test.<br/>
The C.S.D. is unconcerned<br/>
so I&#39;ll decide what&#39;s best.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;No time to stop and eat,<br/>
or pick up stuff to munch.<br/>
And tomorrow you can start to learn<br/>
to make your own sack lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Just save the raging appetite,<br/>
and wait till dinner time.<br/>
We&#39;re having liver and onions,<br/>
a favorite dish of mine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He asked &quot;Can I please rent a movie,<br/>
to watch on my VCR?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Sorry, but I sold your TV,<br/>
for new tires on my car.<br/>
<br/>
I also rented out your room,<br/>
you&#39;ll take the couch instead.<br/>
The C.S.D. requires<br/>
just a roof over your head.<br/>
<br/>
Your clothing won&#39;t be trendy now,<br/>
I&#39;ll choose what we eat. <br/>
That allowance that you used to get,<br/>
will buy me something neat.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m selling off your jet ski,<br/>
dirt-bike & roller blades.<br/>
Check out the &#39;Parents Bill of Rights&#39;,<br/>
It&#39;s in effect today!<br/>
<br/>
Hey hot shot, are you crying,<br/>
Why are you on your knees?<br/>
Are you asking God to help you out,<br/>
instead of C.S.D..?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Send to all people that have teenagers or have already raised <br/>
teenagers, or have children who will soon be teenagers or those who <br/>
will be parents someday OR ANYONE WHO&#39;D JUST GET A LAUGH ...I love <br/>
this One!!!<br/>

My kids (12 & 13) heard the screaming and came to see what they were<br/>
missing.  At first we were all laughing but then my son said &quot;wait --<br/>
Who sent you that?  Doesn&#39;t she have a kid?  That&#39;s pretty sad.&quot;  Good<br/>
observation, I thought.<br/>
<br/>
Then later I said something like, it&#39;s interesting that I&#39;m sure most<br/>
people watching that commercial get a big laugh, and immediately side<br/>
with the guy against the kid, like I did.  But if you think about it,<br/>
it&#39;s his fault to begin with (and not just because he didn&#39;t use a<br/>
condom.)<br/>
<br/>
And my daughter said &quot;Yeah, because the dad was rude. Because like<br/>
imagine if you and dad were in the store, and he put beef jerky in the<br/>
cart and you just tossed it back on the shelf like that. Twice.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Right.  He&#39;d be pissed. Or wonder what&#39;s my problem.<br/>
<br/>
And they both thought it&#39;s sad that people don&#39;t see that.  And I<br/>
realized I&#39;ve come a long way, and I&#39;m sure I used to do stuff like<br/>
that all the time, and maybe still do but not nearly as often or I<br/>
catch myself sooner.  It made me feel good that it&#39;s more automatic<br/>
for them to think like that, and not just because they&#39;re kids,<br/>
because I know plenty of kids who would think that kid in the video<br/>
deserved to be smacked, and as I kid I probably would&#39;ve thought that<br/>
too.  <br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s nice to think that if they have kids they&#39;ll probably be<br/>
really good parents and won&#39;t have to work at it as hard as I have,<br/>
perhaps.  <br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s thanks to many of you on this list and others that I&#39;ve come<br/>
this far.  So a big thanks to all of you who make that effort to<br/>
creatively and carefully explain and discuss these concepts again and<br/>
again -- you&#39;re definitely making a difference in people&#39;s lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830763819"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It has just been in the last 10 years that it changed from using<br/>
&gt; masculine pronouns and man/men, etc. in writing. I was in college<br/>
&gt; in the late 90&#39;s and used &quot;her&quot; in writing because for my purpose I<br/>
&gt; envisioned a woman and my professor marked off for it. Now a friend<br/>
&gt; in college had to study about not being gender biased when writing!<br/>
&gt; She had to correct sentences that said &quot;he&quot; to say &quot;he/she&quot; or<br/>
&gt; something like &quot;a person&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow!  I&#39;m sorry you had that experience!  Silly prof!  I was in college <br/>
in the late 80s, (journalism) and my prof marked off for NOT using <br/>
gender neutral or gender varietal references!  My entire professional <br/>
writing career I&#39;ve used neutral or gender inclusive pronouns ... have <br/>
written for wide audiences and for a broad spectrum of clients, who&#39;ve <br/>
all either accepted without comment or openly acknowledged the implied <br/>
equality.  So my experience has been that masculine only pronouns have <br/>
been out of favour for well more than 20 years, at least!<br/>
