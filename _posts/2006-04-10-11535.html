<br/>
It basically means allowing your child to learn what they want <br/>
through doing things they enjoy? So if my son loves to read and <br/>
loves dinosaurs, it would be reasonable for me to have a dinosaur <br/>
book available for him to read and learn from.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly if he enjoys reading about dragons it would be OK to offer <br/>
him books or movies on dragons and since he likes to write stories, <br/>
I could ask if he wanted to write me a story about the dragon he <br/>
just learned about?<br/>
<br/>
He likes to work in &quot;workbook&quot; type books and do word searches, etc. <br/>
So is it OK to make those available to him as well?<br/>
<br/>
He also likes to help me cook so as we are doing that, it&#39;s ok to <br/>
mention that a 1/4 cup is really 25% of a cup, etc.<br/>
<br/>
He also likes to play with is globe & have us ask him to find <br/>
countries on it so as we do that I could talk to him about the <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We have quite a few workbook type books in our house as well as word<br/>
searches (and sudoku and math books and workbooks on magnets and origami and<br/>
a whole bunch of other subjects that my kids have asked for.)  They&#39;ve seen<br/>
them in the store and look at these things like puzzles.  Sometimes they<br/>
will get one of these workbooks down and spend hours doing every page and<br/>
then put them up for months before lookin at them again.  I don&#39;t buy them<br/>
to &quot;tempt&quot; them but because I know that sometimes they like doing them (just<br/>
like they like coloring sometimes or cutting paper with scissors or planting<br/>
seeds or building Legos!)<br/>
<br/>
He also likes to help me cook so as we are doing that, it&#39;s ok to<br/>
&gt; mention that a 1/4 cup is really 25% of a cup, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sure.  Although I find that perCENTs make much more sense with money.  25¢<br/>
is 25% of $1.00.  If your child enjoys cooking he will learn through<br/>
experimentation and following recipes (or making them up) fractions<br/>
eventually and naturally.  My dd has these mashed potatoes that she likes to<br/>
make.  There are two packages in a box and sometimes she makes only one if<br/>
she just wants some but if the whole family wants some she makes two<br/>
packages.  She&#39;s been making these for the past few months.  When she makes<br/>
two packages she has just been measuring twice.  So she would put in 2/3 cup<br/>
of milk and then another 2/3 cup of milk.  1/4 cup of water and another 1/4<br/>
cup of water.  I&#39;ve let her do it that way because it makes sense and the<br/>
potatoes turn out the correct consistancy.  So tonight she is staring at the<br/>
box and looking at the measuring cups and is suddenly hit with an &quot;ah-ha&quot;<br/>
moment.  &quot;Mom!  2/3 cup plus another 2/3 cup is 1-1/3 cup!  Hey that&#39;s<br/>
pretty cool.&quot;  No; the cool part is that no one told her that!  She then<br/>
went on to tell me what the other measurements were if she were to double it<br/>
rather than add the ingredients twice.  How cool is that?  :)<br/>
<br/>
He also likes to play with is globe & have us ask him to find<br/>
&gt; countries on it so as we do that I could talk to him about the<br/>
&gt; country he found as long as he expresses an interest to know more<br/>
&gt; information?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The key is that you stop thinking of everything you do as an &quot;educational<br/>
moment&quot; and start thinking of it as living.  As adults we don&#39;t (or maybe I<br/>
should say as an adult I don&#39;t) think when we get the new National<br/>
Geographic in terms of &quot;What will I learn from this months&#39; issue?&quot;  Instead<br/>
I see that brown envelope in the mailbox and think, &quot;Oh goodie!!  I wonder<br/>
what wonderful things they have to share with me this month!&quot;   Sure I&#39;m<br/>
learning but I don&#39;t think of reading NG as an &quot;educational moment.&quot;  I like<br/>
reading NG because it stretches my brain, gives me new ideas and insights to<br/>
places I have yet to go (but have an ever growing list of places I want to<br/>
go!)  I feel alive when I read NG.  I also enjoy getting several other<br/>
magazines each month.  While interesting and maybe I learn something from<br/>
them, they don&#39;t excite me like NG does.  That doesn&#39;t lessen their<br/>
importance in my life, just that I use them for different things.  Sort of<br/>
like food.  I eat cake because I enjoy cake.  I enjoy other foods as well,<br/>
but I eat them for different reasons.  I know if all I ate was cake I would<br/>
feel slow, tired, and lithless.  And if I only eat beans and rice and cheese<br/>
and salad I will get bored.  So I have a variety of foods that I eat to meet<br/>
the variety of needs that I have.  And I&#39;m trying to apply that to more<br/>
areas of my life.<br/>

I&#39;m really new at this unschooling path also - isn&#39;t it interesting trying<br/>
to figure it all out? :-)  From what I understand, all of what you are<br/>
saying here is great, so long as your son has the free choice to say, &quot;No<br/>
thanks, I don&#39;t want to do that right now&quot; and you respect his choice to do<br/>
something else.  If he likes workbooks, make them available, but make it<br/>
completely okay for him NOT to do them if he doesn&#39;t want to.  That kind of<br/>
thing.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even more reasonable is to have book*s*, and videos and plastic dinos  <br/>
and trips to dinosaur museums, and kits and fossils ....<br/>
<br/>
Not all at once since that might be overwhelming, but open the world  <br/>
up to him. Make it easy for him to access things that interest him.  <br/>
Think of yourself as his partner. You&#39;re helping him with *his*  <br/>
interests, not trying to funnel what you feel is important into him.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much like you might come across something your husband might  <br/>
like and bring it home for him. But in the case of your son it&#39;s just  <br/>
ratched up more since your son doesn&#39;t have the freedom or ability  <br/>
your husband does to get out into the world. Think of yourself as  <br/>
your son&#39;s arms and legs and eyes to help him reach out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Similarly if he enjoys reading about dragons it would be OK to offer<br/>
&gt; him books or movies on dragons<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on the situation but if it&#39;s stuff from the library, I&#39;d just  <br/>
bring it home. Offer to read them to him, offer to watch the movies  <br/>
with him. If he says no, leave them accessible and then go get more.  <br/>
Make sure he always has access to things he might enjoy. Mix it up  <br/>
with other stuff that you think he might like** so he as access to  <br/>
new interests when he needs them.<br/>
<br/>
(**Note the &quot;think he might like&quot; part. It&#39;s not &quot;think might be good  <br/>
for him&quot; ;-) Most people divide the world into educational and  <br/>
entertainment. Try to see it all the same. Spongebob is as good as  <br/>
Shakespeare. It isn&#39;t the what that&#39;s important, it&#39;s the interest  <br/>
someone has in it that&#39;s important.)<br/>
<br/>
And of course take him to the library and bookstore too if he enjoys  <br/>
it to pick out his own stuff. (My daughter didn&#39;t like the process of  <br/>
picking. It was overwhelming to her and she preferred to have me do  <br/>
the initial picking so she could go through it.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and since he likes to write stories,<br/>

&gt; just learned about?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No and no. It will help to not think of him learning things but doing  <br/>
things he finds interesting. Think of it more as summer vacation.  <br/>
Learning will happen as a side effect of living. Your role is to make  <br/>
a life he enjoys possible for him :-)<br/>
<br/>
Give him free access to paper and pencils and pens and markers and  <br/>
stapler and anything else that will spark his creativity.<br/>
<br/>
If he has stories in him he wants to write but finds writing  <br/>
difficult, take dictation. Give him a tape recorder and let him tape  <br/>
them and you transcribe them. Let him use the computer to type them.  <br/>
Show him how they can be made into books.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He likes to work in &quot;workbook&quot; type books and do word searches, etc.<br/>
&gt; So is it OK to make those available to him as well?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anything he&#39;s enjoying is okay. If *you* see them as more important  <br/>
than coloring books, then store them with the coloring books and  <br/>
forget about them<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He also likes to help me cook so as we are doing that, it&#39;s ok to<br/>
&gt; mention that a 1/4 cup is really 25% of a cup, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sort of. But you&#39;ll never see percent used that way in cooking.  <br/>
(Maybe in a math problem! ;-) but not in the real world.)<br/>
<br/>
Do what&#39;s natural to the situation. Often what happens to us is one  <br/>
cup gets dirty and we need to cobble a measurement together from the  <br/>
cups we have left like &quot;The 1 cup is dirty, how can we measure 1 1/2  <br/>
cups?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d play things like that by ear though. My daughter saw those as  <br/>
interesting challenges. A child who has been in school might hear  <br/>
that as a quiz and shut down. It should be fun and intriguing, not  <br/>
pressure to get a child from where they are to where you think they  <br/>
need to be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He also likes to play with is globe & have us ask him to find<br/>
&gt; countries on it so as we do that I could talk to him about the<br/>
&gt; country he found as long as he expresses an interest to know more<br/>
&gt; information?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, play it by ear. If he&#39;s interested, yes give him more  <br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
But see it according to interest rather than what he&#39;s interested in.  <br/>
You&#39;ve chosen something -- the globe -- that most people would put in  <br/>
the &quot;educational&quot; category. What would you do if you were going  <br/>
through an album of your old family pictures and he pointed to you as  <br/>
a baby and asked about it. How would you respond? Would you try to  <br/>
get your whole family history in because you were afraid he might  <br/>
never ask again? ;-) Gauge your answer by *him*, by his interest, by  <br/>
what *he* wants from the experience.<br/>

  *****<br/>
  It&#39;s always good to help him find or suggest books on topics you think he&#39;d enjoy -- we go to the library once or twice most weeks jsut for this reason.  As to asking him to write....  when he wants to write a story about whatever he loves at that moment, he&#39;ll probably do it without invitation from you.  For you to ask risks having what interests become just school-work, even if done at home. <br/>

&gt; pretty cool.&quot;  No; the cool part is that no one told her that! <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then again there are folks like me who hate having multiple <br/>
measuring cups to wash :-) so I&#39;ll use a 1/3 cup and do 4 scoops to <br/>
make 1 1/3 cups rather than use the 1 cup and the 1/3 cup.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I like<br/>
&gt; reading NG because it stretches my brain, gives me new ideas and <br/>
&gt;insights to<br/>
&gt; places I have yet to go (but have an ever growing list of places I <br/>
&gt;want to<br/>
&gt; go!)  I feel alive when I read NG.  I also enjoy getting several <br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt; magazines each month.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you don&#39;t already get it, try a subscription/membership to <br/>
Smithsonian magazine - some really neat stuff in there, the articles <br/>
are based around tidbits from the various Smithsonian collections. <br/>
That&#39;s right up there with our NG subscription as the two magazines <br/>
we don&#39;t ever consider cancelling. They did a whole serial each <br/>
month over the past year (2005) of excerpts from the journals of the <br/>
Lewis & Clark expedition; they did a big article on the Wright <br/>
brothers; and so on.<br/>
<br/>
NG is one of those magazines that is strew-ful: DS loves the pull <br/>
out maps (he got &#39;hooked&#39; on maps as a 2 yr old when he found a map <br/>
of Antarctica from NG), DH and I both read it pretty much cover to <br/>
cover (although I always read magazines back to front for some <br/>
reason). I love the ZipCode articles in NG - all sorts of neat <br/>
places you may never hear of anyplace else.<br/>
