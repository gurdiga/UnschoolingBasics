<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588517796">HiAll!<br/>
<br/>
I just thought I would weigh in here on Santa Claus. Christy is right, there<br/>
was a discussion about this very topic about a month ago now on Unschooling<br/>
Discussion group. I would like to post here what I wrote in response to<br/>
Angela&#39;s post on that list as well as her message. If you go to the archives<br/>
 you can find the other responses as well!:).....<br/>
Oh and P.S. I agree with both you Christy with what you wrote &quot;<br/>
I also believe in fairies in general....I don&#39;t feel it is lying to him,<br/>
because I do believe these things exist.  If at some point in his life he<br/>
decides the evidence isn&#39;t<br/>
strong enough to support his believe, that is fine.  It won&#39;t change<br/>
what I believe.&quot; as this is too, how I feel and what I believe!:)<br/>
 <br/>
 and Cat&#39;s suggestions for how to approach not telling others about why to<br/>
believe or not. Cat wrote &quot;that it is unkind to tell those children that<br/>
Santa is not real - under the general principle of not bursting other people<br/>
s bubbles.  It goes along with not expressing her unfavorable opinion of art<br/>
that other children are proud of and similar issues of celebrating rather<br/>
than dampening other people&#39;s happiness.&quot; I feel the same as this is how I<br/>
approach it with my children when they ask me why some children believe or<br/>
do not and why.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow....here is a copy of my post below from the other group and Angela&#39;s<br/>
as well. You can check out the archives for the rest on the Unschooling<br/>
Discussions site!:)<br/>
<br/>
Blessings and Light,<br/>

They had this discussion not too long ago on Unschooling Discussion<br/>
if you want to go look through the archives.  I was one who said that<br/>
I told my son about Santa and the tooth fairy because we don&#39;t really<br/>
know for sure they don&#39;t exist.  Just because we haven&#39;t seen them<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t real.  I&#39;ve never seen an electron or a<br/>
quark, doesn&#39; mean I don&#39;t believe they are real.  I choose to<br/>
believe Santa and the tooth fairy are real in some way.  So that is<br/>
what I tell my son I believe.  I know they aren&#39;t leaving presents<br/>
under the tree or putting money under my son&#39;s pillow but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean they don&#39;t exist.<br/>
 <br/>
I also believe in fairies in general and my son and I put honey out<br/>
for them.  One time we had a beautiful flower grow in the exact spot<br/>
we put the honey.  We didn&#39;t plant the flower.  During Yule my son<br/>
gets presents from Mother Earth.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t feel it is lying to him, because I do believe these things<br/>

Subject: RE: Santa<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m conflicted about the whole Santa thing.<br/>
 <br/>
When the kids were very small I never considered not playing out the Santa<br/>
fantasy.  I love Santa!  I still remember when I found out he was fantasy.<br/>
I was in third grade and the kids went around the table asking if you<br/>
believed in Santa.  No one said yes, and I didn&#39;t either.  But that<br/>
was the<br/>
first time I questioned it.  I asked my mother and she said that if I<br/>
didn&#39;t<br/>
believe, he wouldn&#39;t come.  I&#39;ve believed ever since.  ;0)  I didn&#39;t feel<br/>
betrayed by my mother at all, though.<br/>
 <br/>
Then one day I was talking with a cousin who also homeschools her children<br/>
and she said she told her kids from the start that Santa wasn&#39;t real.  At<br/>
first I thought it was awful for her to ruin the fantasy part of Christmas<br/>
but after giving it some thought I started to feel bad that I had lied<br/>
to my<br/>
children about this, but been very honest with them in all other regards.<br/>
The reason she told her kids from the start that Santa was fantasy is<br/>
because she felt like she was the last one to learn the truth and she felt<br/>
her mother had lied to her.  She lived next to the school and one day<br/>
in 5th<br/>
grade all the kids were saying that Santa wasn&#39;t real.  She went home and<br/>
asked her mother and her mother didn&#39;t tell her the truth and she went<br/>
back<br/>
to school and argued it with the kids.  In the end she ended up feeling<br/>
stupid and lied to.   (If my kids asked, I would either tell them the<br/>
truth,<br/>
though.)<br/>
 <br/>
Over the years it has seemed like I&#39;ve had to keep lying and changing the<br/>
lies to keep it under wraps.  (or sometimes I just say I don&#39;t know...this<br/>
is what happened when I was little.)  Over the last few years I&#39;ve<br/>
tried not<br/>
to lie outright about Santa but put it a little differently......&quot;we&#39;d<br/>
better get to bed, *they say* Santa only comes when you are fast asleep.&quot;<br/>
(kind of like Sandra mentioned.)<br/>
 <br/>
From the time the kids were small we had gifts from Santa and gifts<br/>
from us.<br/>
Santa fills the stockings and leaves a few small gifts and the rest is<br/>
from<br/>
us.  I can&#39;t really change that now but it has always been confusing<br/>
for me<br/>
because I can never remember what gifts were from Santa and what were from<br/>
us, after the fact.  So two months later when a mom asks me where we got<br/>
something, I&#39;m likely to say enthusiastically, oh, I got that on ebay for<br/>
only $5, to which my children pipe up...&quot;no you didn&#39;t, we got that from<br/>
Santa!&quot; Agh!!!   I&#39;ve done that more times than I care to mention.  I am<br/>
getting better at saying &quot;we got it for Christmas, (and tell the details<br/>
later)  but I still forget in my enthusiasm to share a good idea or good<br/>
deal.)  My kids have always asked why we need to give to charities at<br/>
Christmas time.  Doesn&#39;t Santa give presents to everyone?   Having gifts<br/>
from both Santa and us made it easier to answer that question...Santa only<br/>
fills stocking and brings a few small gifts, but the kids seem to think<br/>
they&#39;d be perfectly happy with just the Santa gifts, so why isn&#39;t everyone<br/>
else?<br/>
 <br/>
But as my oldest gets older (she&#39;s almost 10) I have begun to worry more<br/>
about her learning the truth and feeling betrayed.  Obviously, she doesn&#39;t<br/>
go to school so she won&#39;t be questioned there.  She has one very close<br/>
friend who also believes.  She also plays with cousins somewhat regularly<br/>
but I am not sure if they would talk about that.  Will she ever learn the<br/>
truth or will I have to sneak into her house when she is grown up to<br/>
deliver<br/>
presents to her kids?  LOL!  She is very analytical so part of me<br/>
wonders if<br/>
she didn&#39;t figure it out years ago and just wants to believe so badly that<br/>
she&#39;s willing to overlook the inconsistencies.  If she asks for the<br/>
truth I<br/>
will certainly tell her but until both my girls know I think I will feel a<br/>
little unease somewhere in the back of my mind about it.  I wish I&#39;d<br/>
been a<br/>
little more mysterious about it instead of seeming like I had the<br/>
facts when<br/>
they were smaller.  I did tell them that the santas in stores are not the<br/>
real Santa....but that feels like a lie too, for goodness sakes.  (it<br/>
indicates that there is a *real* Santa.)<br/>
 <br/>
I love &quot;Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus&quot; and I&#39;ve always thought I&#39;d<br/>
read that to the kids when they question me.  Sometimes thing happen<br/>
off the<br/>
cuff here though and I forget what I&#39;ve planned.  We&#39;ll see, I guess.<br/>

Subject: Re: Santa....a different view<br/>
 <br/>
Why be conflicted about the whole Santa thing? Yes, Santa may very<br/>
well be a fantasy character, a man much like Superman, Batman or<br/>
Spiderman in our fantasy world..... but if you can look behind the man<br/>
into what he represents in the eyes of children and in my eyes, you<br/>
will find  something much more real.<br/>
 <br/>
To me, I love Santa. I loved Santa even when I found out he was not<br/>
&quot;real&quot;. I was not disappointed or hurt by what appeared to be my<br/>
parents &quot;lies&quot;, because I never interpreted them as &quot;lies&quot;. The only<br/>
thing I was upset about was the fact that my mother used the same<br/>
wrapping paper and tags for the presents she and my dad gave, as she<br/>
did the ones from Santa. I think my reasoning there was one of that if<br/>
she was going to have made such strides to have the gifts be from two<br/>
different sets of people without us knowing it, why use the same paper<br/>
then? :)<br/>
 <br/>
So, why was I not hurt or disappointed about discovering that the<br/>
physical person of Santa was being portrayed by my parents? Because<br/>
for me, Santa is and always has been since as far back as I can<br/>
remember, been the belief in what is possible. Santa is not so much of<br/>
a HE but rather a what is. It is a knowing that although we cannot<br/>
always see something - faith, hope, love, magic, fate, miracles, what<br/>
can be, possibility....... we can still believe. We can still believe<br/>
in what can be, in life, no matter what logic may tell us. <br/>
 <br/>
Do we believe in love and the power of love to go beyond what we<br/>
humans can see and reason? You bet we do, and we believe in it so<br/>
strongly that sometimes it can make us blind to what is real. But we<br/>
believe in it nonetheless, and it is not something real in the sense<br/>
of something we can feel, touch, smell, taste or hear....but we<br/>
believe, we believe in it&#39;s power and in it&#39;s strength and in the<br/>
essence of knowing it is what brings us all together, no matter what<br/>
race, no matter what (fill in the blank).....<br/>
 <br/>
Santa may not be real in the sense of we cannot feel, touch, smell,<br/>
taste or hear him BUT we can believe in what he is in our hearts - a<br/>
sense of innocence, a sense of awe and wonder at life and of life and<br/>
in life. We can believe in that all things are possible and that life<br/>
is the miracle that it is because we choose to see it for the miracle<br/>
that it is. Santa is so much more than just someone who brings<br/>
children presents on Christmas while we all go to sleep. It is a<br/>
belief of something that is beyond what we can use our five senses to<br/>
see, materialize and realize - the magic of what is possible in life<br/>
beyond any reason or explanation, it just is..... and the spirit in<br/>
which that can happen, that needs to be felt and seen here. Seeing is<br/>
not believing, believing is seeing!<br/>
 <br/>
That is who Santa is to me. Do I believe in Santa? You bet I do and I<br/>
will always believe in him until I draw my last breath! Do my kids<br/>
believe? They are 13, 7, (almost 8, next month) and 6 and you bet they<br/>
do! :) They will not feel betrayed when they learn of the truth that I<br/>
am the one who gives them the presents under the tree and in their<br/>
stockings, instead of a physical man who wears a red suit, because<br/>
they know of what Santa truly is in all of which I have written here<br/>
and more, beyond what our minds can reason. And THAT is what will be<br/>
keep Santa alive in their hearts and keep them believing in Santa, not<br/>
for the figure of the man he is, but for what he is and can be within<br/>
their hearts.<br/>

What you wrote was beautiful and also the theme behind &quot;yes Virginia,<br/>
there<br/>
is a Santa Claus&quot;, which I love and plan to share with my children at some<br/>
point.<br/>
 <br/>
I also wanted to mention that the cousin I mentioned who felt so<br/>
betrayed by<br/>
her parents also had a LOT of other issues with regards to her parent&#39;s<br/>
parenting.  So, it&#39;s not like the Santa issue was the only thing she was<br/>
lied to about.  There was both physical and mental abuse to go with it.<br/>

 <br/>
Hi Angela!<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you for your kind words. And yes, you are right it does fall<br/>
under the &quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus&quot;! :) One of my<br/>
favorite books.....When I read it, it makes me cry! :) <br/>
 <br/>
I understand that of your cousin&#39;s situation, as well. Believe it or<br/>
not, my parents were also physical and emotionally and mentally<br/>
abusive too. My mother used to beat me with anything she could find -<br/>
a shoe, a belt buckle or her favorite was for me to find my &quot;switch&quot;<br/>
from this long tall purple tree in our front yard with long thin<br/>
branches. My father, he was and still is emotionally abusive. His<br/>
words cut like a knife to me as a young impressionable young girl.<br/>
 <br/>
It took counseling when I was 13 (after my mother was attempting to<br/>
beat me in the kitchen with a shoe and I grabbed a knife in self<br/>
defense), for us to get past the physical abuse, and she then never<br/>
laid a hand on me again. And should would never even dream of doing so<br/>
with my children, as she is getting her &quot;second chance&quot; as she puts it<br/>
to make things right.<br/>
 <br/>
My father, is my father, and I have accepted that he is who he is. He<br/>
continues to abuse me in this way even today. When I have stronger<br/>
days, I stand up to him, other days it is harder when I am sick (I<br/>
have just been diagnosed with Lupus and Thrombophilia or sticky blood<br/>
as it is called) but overall I try not to let his words pierce me and<br/>
I have learned too that I cannot change him, only change myself and my<br/>
reaction or non-reaction to it.<br/>
 <br/>
So I can relate very much to your cousin. But somehow, for me, despite<br/>
the abuses going on, there were good times I remember and my feelings<br/>
about Santa never changed, I just love the spirit and meaning behind<br/>
Santa, as I wrote! :) Has your cousin been able to work through the<br/>
issues?<br/>
 <br/>
So, yes, Angela, there is a Santa Claus! :)<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for making my day sweeter by your kind words!:) <br/>
