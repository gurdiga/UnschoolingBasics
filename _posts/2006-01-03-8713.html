<div id="ygrps-yiv-35594079">&quot;I wonder where Ren and Sandra found that...on unschooling.com maybe??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You want me to actually REMEMBER!! Ack.<br/>
<br/>
Um....I&#39;ll look at my notes, but I could swear it was one of your <br/>
posts at a list...perhaps this one? Let me see if I can satisfy your <br/>
curiosity. I know it was a message you had posted somewhere, because <br/>
you had described how you came up with it.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you&#39;d already read the darn thing, or I would have told you <br/>
we quoted you!:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-839924548">Ok, this is a small miracle, (because I am famous for my <br/>
disorganization) but I just walked away from the computer, remembering <br/>
I had just turned up some of my notes from the conference while <br/>
organizing and found your quote Leslie!<br/>
<br/>
I flipped down a few pages, and there it was, highlighted.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s from the thread we had going here about healing and unschooling <br/>
back on July 28th of this year.<br/>
<br/>
You answered my question about the healing that unschooling promotes <br/>
and talked about coming up with the affirmation &quot;My family learns in <br/>
peace and joy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So there you have it......<br/>

LOL!  Mystery solved!!  Thanks, Ren!  Gee, if I had any  memory, I would have <br/>
remembered writing that.  But it does sound  familiar.<br/>
 <br/>
That mystery started way back at the conference when my friend who went (I  <br/>
didn&#39;t) called me and said, &quot;do you know you are quoted in the conference  <br/>
handout on one of Sandra&#39;s talks?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
The first thing I said was &quot;did I make a fool of myself?&quot;  (because  that <br/>
tends to happen).<br/>
 <br/>
So, it wasn&#39;t a huge mystery, except she did leave out the Ren part, which  <br/>
would have made more sense because I&#39;ve only been here and Shine for quite  <br/>
awhile.<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry I &quot;made you look&quot; Ren.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
Leslie, feeling famous<br/>
