<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524776989">~~I&#39;m not sure where this<br/>
embarrassment comes from. Could it just be his age?~~<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely. Without reading the whole thread, I&#39;m just going to<br/>
respond to what my first thought was.....you gave him too much<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we need to be honest with our children. Yes, we need to tell the<br/>
whole truth, but not all at once. I&#39;m thinking he started down a line<br/>
of questioning and wanted SOME information, but maybe got more than he<br/>
was ready for? Maybe?<br/>
<br/>
So he&#39;s sorting through all that information and feeling overwhelmed.<br/>
I would let him know that I honor his feelings but he can&#39;t call me<br/>
names and try to make ME feel badly about something that is natural.<br/>
I&#39;d let him know that when I was a kid, I thought it was gross too and<br/>
that&#39;s very normal and natural.  I&#39;d tell him that next time he asks<br/>
questions about a topic that is uncomfortable for him, you&#39;re going to<br/>
give shorter and more general answers for now.<br/>
<br/>
Sex has always been discussed very naturally here, so there was never<br/>
a point at which anyone was really surprised by any information.  They<br/>
just slowly wanted more details and some of it grossed them out of<br/>
course, but there was never a strong reaction.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t possibly know why he&#39;s reacting so strongly, but I&#39;m just<br/>
guessing he got TMI.:) Sometimes when our kids ask, we need to be<br/>
brief and only add on after they ask more. If he kept on wanting more<br/>
and more, then he got what he needed and it&#39;s the processing that he&#39;s<br/>
having a hard time with.  I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to let someone know they<br/>
aren&#39;t going to call me names and treat me badly, as upset as they<br/>
are. It&#39;s ok to think what you want to think, it&#39;s not cool to go<br/>
around attacking someone all day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-365363299">Yes, I told him that I was concerned when he first started asking questions<br/>

several times to find a basic definition of certain words. <br/>
<br/>
There were several things he asked that I really didn&#39;t think he was ready<br/>

happy with vague answers and can see right away when you are trying to gloss<br/>
over something. <br/>
<br/>
How could I have handled that better?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228628324">I would have answered that question with a question...&quot;What do you  <br/>
mean?&quot; or &quot;What do you think?&quot;. Sometimes learning isn&#39;t about  <br/>
hearing the answers, but having the opportunity to sound out your  <br/>
thoughts on another person. Maybe the clash between what he was  <br/>
thinking and what you were saying was too much ;-)<br/>
