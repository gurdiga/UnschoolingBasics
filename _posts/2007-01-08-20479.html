<div id="ygrps-yiv-617856538">&lt;&lt;&lt;That&#39;s something I&#39;m a little timid about. I just want to know if <br/>
all<br/>
&quot;types&quot; are card-carrying unschoolers according to the group here. :)<br/>
I ask this pleasantly, and positively, as I&#39;m eager to learn more.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling will look a little different in every household but <br/>
there are some &quot;core&quot; (if you want to put it that way) philosophies <br/>
or ideals that we all hold.  I would dare to say that TRUST is the <br/>
main thing.  If we trust are children to learn what they need, when <br/>
they need it, than we should trust them in all other areas of their <br/>
lives.  We see ourselves as our children&#39;s partners, their friends, <br/>
their teammates.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are lots others that can expand on that, I&#39;m not <br/>
always so good at putting my thoughts and emotions into words but I <br/>
would say there are definitely core beliefs in the unschooling <br/>
community that when you say you are an unschooler there is an <br/>
assumption of certain shared philosophies. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone can be an unschooler, as far as different religious beliefs <br/>
etc.  but there may be some religions or cultures that don&#39;t lend <br/>
themselves to trusting their children but are more rule driven, <br/>
legalistic, etc  For instance, I consider myself a Christian but <br/>
don&#39;t allow myself (or try not to) be put in the Christian box.  <br/>
There are some &quot;universal&quot; Christian beliefs that I don&#39;t agree <br/>
with.  I jokingly say that I am a &quot;liberal Christian&quot;.  There are <br/>
some Christians that think our lifestyle is not all Christian-like <br/>
because our children can debate with us, question us,  they can <br/>
watch R rated movies, they swear every so often etc,  I choose not <br/>
to let that bother me.  The truth is that I don&#39;t fit into any box, <br/>
or try not to anyway.   I follow my heart and instincts.</div>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re &quot;liberal Christians&quot; too.   and we follow our heart and instincts,<br/>
and our children, when they&#39;ve chosen to, have seen movies I most<br/>
certainly would have been forbidden as a child (grin).  But my children<br/>
get freedom to choose things they want to do... and their needs and<br/>
wants are listened to and met just like my husband and I meet each<br/>
other&#39;s needs.  I follow my heart and instincts too.<br/>
<br/>
That eases my mind, and it&#39;s nice to know that unschooling can encompass<br/>
many things.  I&#39;ve been calling myself an unschooler for many years,<br/>
because of the ultimate freedom and embracing of who they are beyond<br/>
compare, for the last several years out of school.  (and 2 who have<br/>
never been to school)<br/>
