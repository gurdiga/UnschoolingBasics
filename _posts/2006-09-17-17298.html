and I&#39;m old enough to be your children&#39;s mother.  LOL!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are they motivated to *learn* what you give them or are they going<br/>
through the motions and regurjitation what you have given them to<br/>
&quot;learn&quot;?  If you are &quot;school at homing&quot; then you are doing little<br/>
better for their education than if they were in school (except *you*<br/>
get to control what curriculum that they use).  If you haven&#39;t bought<br/>
curriculum this year, set that money aside for all the things that<br/>
they want to pursue.  Go on a vacation (literally or figuratively,<br/>
whichever your budget can afford) and then don&#39;t come back (mentally<br/>
of course unless you can afford to go on a lifelong vacation :) )<br/>
Start saying yes more and DESCHOOL!  There are tons of articles at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling</a>  and look through the various<br/>
blogs listed in people&#39;s siglines.  Get the Teenage Liberation<br/>
Handbook and you and your children read it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, please realize that unschooling isn&#39;t about them learning what<br/>
you feel is important.  It&#39;s about them learning what they feel is<br/>
important and what they need to get to where they are going.  Look<br/>
through the archives of this list at the yahoogroups and you will see<br/>
that quite a few people have concerns about &quot;what happens after the<br/>
&#39;high school years&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s never too late!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934633968">What&#39;s your goal? To have a diploma at age 18? If so, keep schooling <br/>
them at home.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is to give your children happy childhoods (now <br/>
teenagehoods &lt;g&gt;) with a love of learning and a deep, abiding trust in <br/>
you, then you&#39;ve come to the right place. Unchooling can do that. It <br/>
can also allow you to give your children dipomas---BUT you have to be <br/>
willing to let go of those schoolish goals.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s never too late, but you&#39;re pushing it with your son. Maybe <br/>
consider delaying the &quot;diploma&quot; with him so that he can heal. There&#39;s <br/>
no &quot;end&quot; of learning, but he&#39;s going to need to DEschool a while before <br/>
you can consider unschooling him. Average time is one month for each <br/>
year spent in school or school-at-home. Maybe more for sensitive <br/>
types---and maybe more if you don&#39;t quit nagging or start trusting them.<br/>
<br/>
DEschooling *often* looks like watching tv all day. In my house, it <br/>
looked like sleeping, watching TV, talking on the phone, IMing friends, <br/>
and sleeping some more. I took Cameron (now 18) out of school at the <br/>
end of sixth grade when he was 13. His deschooling took 18 <br/>
months---more than it *should* have, but *I* had a hard time not <br/>
nagging and pushing. I think we could have moved along more quickly had <br/>
*I* been more deschooled! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They WON&#39;T be motivated to learn, more than likely. There&#39;s always the <br/>
exception, of course, but they desperately need to heal. And THAT looks <br/>
like ...well....not much! It looks like tv and sleeping and lounging. <br/>
But that IS healing. AND there&#39;s learning going on there even if *you* <br/>
don&#39;t want to believe it! It&#39;s not easy to watch, I can tell  you. But <br/>
if you TRUST them, they&#39;ll slowly start to trust *you* and get better. <br/>
Then they&#39;ll find new passions or resurrect old ones, and then they&#39;re <br/>
OFF!<br/>
<br/>
How much in the way of funds do you have? You&#39;ve BEEN buying curricula. <br/>
I KNOW *that&#39;s* expensive! Instead of a curriculum, buy an iPod or join <br/>
Netflix or a used PS2 with games. Plan travel---you can stay in <br/>
friends&#39; homes all across the country.<br/>
<br/>
Colleges are starting to pursue unschoolers because of their <br/>
interesting lives and passions. You don&#39;t necessarily make a typical <br/>
college transcript---although that&#39;s *possible*. Better to submit a <br/>
posrtfolio with lots of letters and references. Make your child&#39;s <br/>
education    S T A N D  O U T !!! from all the thousands that the <br/>
admissions director has to slog through. Don&#39;t even TRY to make his <br/>
transcript look &quot;average&quot;! Make it DIFFERENT! and EXCITING! and <br/>
LOOK-AT-ABLE!<br/>
<br/>
The best thing I can tell you from a BTDT perspective is to free your <br/>
children and enjoy them. Make popcorn. Watch movies. GO places <br/>
together. Live life!  THEN write down what learning you&#39;ve seen <br/>
happening *after* the fact. You&#39;ll be surprised! They&#39;re learning <br/>
machines---*after* they get all that toxicity out of their systems.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to respond to your concern about having little money for<br/>
resources. You might want to brainstorm about the free resources you<br/>
have available to you where you live or already have (a few you<br/>
mentioned). There are tons of free ways for your kids to learn. If<br/>
your child has an interest in a certain profession they can find a<br/>
mentor or an appreciticeship. I am sure there are many people around<br/>
that know things or that will share their resources and are happy that<br/>
someone is interested in what they are interested in. Your kids may<br/>
want to be dropped off somewhere to just explore or you could travel<br/>
together and visit friends in other cities. Talk to them and see what<br/>
they think they would want to do if they had the freedom to do<br/>
anything. Then you can come up with ways to make that happen.<br/>
<br/>
Have you looked into connecting with other unschoolers in your area<br/>
for support? They would be helpful in ideas for free resources as well<br/>
as giving your kids an idea of what fun they could be having. You also<br/>
may take comfort in seeing the results of unschooling first-hand.<br/>
<br/>
Since your kids are older they may want to earn money themselves to<br/>
buy or do the things they are interested in. It could be making and<br/>
selling things or working for someone part-time.<br/>
<br/>
You might think about taking the money you have been spending on<br/>
curriculum and giving them an allowance to buy their own resources or<br/>
discuss as a group how it should be spent on a monthly basis.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you will probably initially encounter a period of &quot;doing nothing&quot;<br/>
healing from schoolish learning. I know as a kid I had things that I<br/>
was interested in outside of school and maybe your kids have some too.<br/>
Give them to freedom to explore them and have a great time--all of<br/>
you! School it out!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
Thanks so much to all of you who replied to my questons concerning<br/>
unschooling.  Naturally I have more questions and fears.  Let me<br/>
explain our situation a bit further.<br/>
We live in an extremely remote area on four acres in a trailer; trying<br/>
to build a house for the last three years.  Having currently run out<br/>
of money to complete it we have curtailed this project. The town of<br/>
Winchester is about ten miles from our home.  My son is involved in<br/>
Civil Air Patrol, but my daughter has no social outlets here. <br/>
Finances and the fact that we own eight (yes, eight) dogs interferes<br/>
with us going too far away from home.  We are quite isolated.  So,<br/>
although I am convinced that following a strict curriculum at home is<br/>
pretty much a waste of time as they will forget most of what I make<br/>
them learn and it will not be pertinent to what they eventually do<br/>
with their live I still wonder if unschooling will work in our situation?<br/>
I have three older boys, two of which were educated through the public<br/>
schools.  My oldest had trouble in high school only because he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t do his homework and was totally unmotivated.  He did however<br/>
manage to get himself into Pratt Institute in New York with a $10,000<br/>
scholarship and a GPA of 2.6.  I believe it was his art portfolio that<br/>
accomplished this.  He graduated this past May, one of only 160 with a<br/>
Bachelor&#39;s in Architecture.  My 21 year old is on the west coast<br/>
learning computer graphics and 3d amimation to some day make computer<br/>
games.  Please don&#39;t think I am telling you this to brag.  I just made<br/>
the connection that both of them are doing things that they did not<br/>
learn in public school.  I know they both love art.  The second didn&#39;t<br/>
find out how talented he was until his senior year and then paid for<br/>
his own private lessons, put together his own portfolio and got into a<br/>
school that only accepted 50 new applicants a year.  Obviously, his<br/>
career also stemmed from almost an addiction to playing video games. <br/>
By the way he first wanted to do the progamming part of gaming, but<br/>
switched to the animation because in the fall of his senior year he<br/>
found out he hated programming from the class he was taking in school!<br/>
 They both took almost no basic courses in college; the ones that are<br/>
just a continuation of high school, but were able to start right in<br/>
with their majors.  I won&#39;t go into my third son as this is getting<br/>
too long, but I now see that my older kids did what they wanted and it<br/>
virtually had nothing to do with publc school.  Another reinforcement<br/>
for unschooling.<br/>
My fears with my other two come from our isolation, will they <br/>
eventually be motivated to get absorbed in something they are really <br/>
interested in, if they choose to go to college how will they get in<br/>
without the credits they need, is our situation so unique will<br/>
unschooling just not work for us, and lastly fear of ruining their<br/>
chance for success which I feel very responsible for?  I hope you have<br/>
some positive answers and ideas for me.  Is there anyone out there who<br/>
 is in our situation or has been and has been successful?  A friend of<br/>
mine who I spoke to about this I know thinks I&#39;m completely crazy.<br/>
I am taking a religious excemption so I won&#39;t ever have to worry about<br/>
the authorities wanting test results and my intention to homeschool<br/>
including outling my curriculum.<br/>
Last week we spent the week doing no school and my kids and I pretty<br/>
much just layed around, read, watched T.V., etc.  I was extremely<br/>
bored except for the day we went to town for a Dr.&#39;s appointment.  I<br/>
asked my son if he wanted to go back to doing school and he said no. <br/>
  He has previously expressed wanting to go back to public school, but<br/>
I am against it.  I guess I&#39;m afraid he might get so bored that he<br/>
will want to again.<br/>
Well, I will stop.  I know this is way too long, but I hope someone<br/>
will take the time to read it and possibly respond.  I have been<br/>
reading the Teenage Liberation Handbook which I find reinforces the<br/>
way I feel about public schools.  Thanks for listening,<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We live in an extremely remote area on four acres in a trailer; trying<br/>

&gt; of money to complete it we have curtailed this project. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, you are not alone. I live in a remote area as well and we are<br/>
living in the very unfinished house that my husband built. We have<br/>
also run out of money and are only able to do projects with materials<br/>
we already have or that don&#39;t cost anything. My husband is going to<br/>
get started installing Internet Satellite Dishes and hopefully we will<br/>
be able to get some more projects done (like insulation and drywall,<br/>
siding, walls and doors, shower, etc.). Some would not find this place<br/>
livable, but we manage.<br/>
<br/>
The town of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Winchester is about ten miles from our home.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We live about an hour east of Shreveport, LA. (Which Winchester do you<br/>
live near?) There is not much to speak of here at first glance, but we<br/>
are always looking for learning opportunities. I do have to drive<br/>
quite a ways for certain things, but that is just the way it is out<br/>
here. We are not only far from a major city, but we are far from most<br/>
people who have alternative thinking like we do (especially any who<br/>
have organized themselves into a group or business). I remember<br/>
visiting my relatives in Massachusetts this summer and I loved that<br/>
you could be remote, but that there were often many interesting,<br/>
educated, eccentric people and businesses around these remote places.<br/>
What I wouldn&#39;t give to have these kind of resources around me. I<br/>
don&#39;t, so I have to look a my neighbors and area in a different light<br/>
or just search out further. There are people here who have different<br/>
talents and specialties to offer and occasionally we run across<br/>
another &quot;freak in the woods&quot;. It helps that my husband&#39;s parents who<br/>
live 500 ft. away are fairly interesting people--lots of collected<br/>
junk and books to tinker with and enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
My son is involved in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Civil Air Patrol, but my daughter has no social outlets here. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find the internet (and the inter-library loan system of books) very<br/>
important for me in my remoteness. It brings me close to friends who<br/>
are far way as well as has been a ways of finding new friends in my<br/>
area and beyond.<br/>
<br/>
It has been a way for me to find out about many local opportunities<br/>
for fun and learning for my son (Though we haven&#39;t done much as of<br/>
yet. Once my husband gets a truck for his work and I have a car I can<br/>
use every day, there will be more.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Finances and the fact that we own eight (yes, eight) dogs interferes<br/>
&gt; with us going too far away from home.  We are quite isolated.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You said you can&#39;t travel much. Have you considered sending your kids<br/>
somewhere: to visit a brother or another relative or to a retreat of<br/>
some kind--maybe as counselors, so it won&#39;t cost so much. You can also<br/>
just explore and visit places your area on day or day and a half<br/>
trips, perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
It is always difficult for me and my almost 3 year old to get up and<br/>
go somewhere like Shreveport or other nearby towns. We have a special<br/>
diet, so I have to prepared meals for us on the road. I have thought<br/>
about making a goal for at least one fun trip to the city a week.<br/>
Money is very tight right now, so we are worried about how much the<br/>
gas will cost for too much driving. I am optimistic though that we or<br/>
he will find the opportunities and resources that are needed when the<br/>
time comes, even though to outward seeming I live in an area devoid of<br/>
culture and interest.<br/>
<br/>
I personally would try to expose them to lots of different things and<br/>
see where it takes you. Whatever you can find. Stay busy with things<br/>
(when they are ready and want to) and even if they reject them, at<br/>
least they will know more about what they DON&#39;T like. While they are<br/>
unwinding from their school-at-home experience, you can wait for them<br/>
to reach out to you for suggestions on things to do or you could offer<br/>
some fun ideas, like lets rent or borrow a bunch of movies or go to an<br/>
amusement park or whatever. (if renting movies is costly, most<br/>
libraries have movies and if there is nothing there you like, they can<br/>
usually get a requested item through interlibrary loan. the louisiana<br/>
interlibrary loan catalog is online and i can browse it anytime. i<br/>
share this because most people don&#39;t think to use this resource,<br/>
though homeschoolers i&#39;m sure are more savvy than your average library<br/>
patron. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My fears with my other two come from our isolation, will they <br/>
&gt; eventually be motivated to get absorbed in something they are really <br/>
&gt; interested in, if they choose to go to college how will they get in<br/>
&gt; without the credits they need, is our situation so unique will<br/>
&gt; unschooling just not work for us, and lastly fear of ruining their<br/>
&gt; chance for success which I feel very responsible for?  I hope you have<br/>
&gt; some positive answers and ideas for me.  Is there anyone out there who<br/>
&gt;  is in our situation or has been and has been successful?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know there are many homeschoolers and unschoolers who go onto<br/>
college. The &quot;Unschooling Handbook&quot; shows an example of a transcript<br/>
written for a child that was unschooled. The book also mentioned that<br/>
colleges may look favorably on homeschooler/unschoolers because they<br/>
may know better what they want (unlike so many college students who<br/>
have no direction) and they are motivated to learn. But if your kids<br/>
are like your other kids, they will find a way to get what they want,<br/>
once something sparks their interest. I have two art degrees and I<br/>
think I could have taught myself most of what I learned by working my<br/>
way up in a good graphic design studio and on my own or even explored<br/>
other areas of interest without the constraints of a degree.<br/>
<br/>
Also, try not to feel so much pressure about them figuring things out<br/>
by the time they are 18, when most kids go to college. I took time off<br/>
in the middle of college and traveled and did some service. There may<br/>
be opportunities, paid, unpaid, and free for your kids to travel/learn<br/>
when they are old enough. I wish I had done more exploring internally<br/>
and physically before I went to college.<br/>
<br/>
Would your kids be interest in volunteering/doing an intership (paid<br/>
or unpaid) somewhere that interests them? It might be a way for them<br/>
to make more social contacts. (I forget how old they are.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Last week we spent the week doing no school and my kids and I pretty<br/>
&gt; much just layed around, read, watched T.V., etc.  I was extremely<br/>
&gt; bored except for the day we went to town for a Dr.&#39;s appointment.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What are your interests? Maybe your kids need to see you unschool<br/>
yourself as well and pursue some of your own passions. Just an idea.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can find other unschoolers in your area/state for support.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if any of this is helpful, but I thought I would share.<br/>
It is difficult to come up with the exact answers when I don&#39;t know<br/>
every detail of your situation and don&#39;t know your kids. You will be<br/>
their best guide, partner and companion in exploring themselves and<br/>
their world.<br/>
<br/>
I have hope for you and for us all. I sincerely believe that<br/>
unschooling or not should not depend on where you are (if it is<br/>
legal). Life is everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
best of luck!<br/>

 Yes, I do live in Winchester, VA.  Where do you live and what are the<br/>
ages of your children?  Have you been unschooling for very long and do<br/>
you belong to any support groups?  I would love to hear from you and<br/>
maybe we could get together.  Look forward to hearing from you.<br/>

&gt; Hi again,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We live in an extremely remote area on four acres in a trailer; trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; to build a house for the last three years.  Having currently run out<br/>
&gt; &gt; of money to complete it we have curtailed this project. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, you are not alone. I live in a remote area as well and we are<br/>
&gt; living in the very unfinished house that my husband built. We have<br/>
&gt; also run out of money and are only able to do projects with materials<br/>
&gt; we already have or that don&#39;t cost anything. My husband is going to<br/>
&gt; get started installing Internet Satellite Dishes and hopefully we will<br/>
&gt; be able to get some more projects done (like insulation and drywall,<br/>
&gt; siding, walls and doors, shower, etc.). Some would not find this place<br/>
&gt; livable, but we manage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The town of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Winchester is about ten miles from our home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We live about an hour east of Shreveport, LA. (Which Winchester do you<br/>
&gt; live near?) There is not much to speak of here at first glance, but we<br/>
&gt; are always looking for learning opportunities. I do have to drive<br/>
&gt; quite a ways for certain things, but that is just the way it is out<br/>
&gt; here. We are not only far from a major city, but we are far from most<br/>
&gt; people who have alternative thinking like we do (especially any who<br/>
&gt; have organized themselves into a group or business). I remember<br/>
&gt; visiting my relatives in Massachusetts this summer and I loved that<br/>
&gt; you could be remote, but that there were often many interesting,<br/>
&gt; educated, eccentric people and businesses around these remote places.<br/>
&gt; What I wouldn&#39;t give to have these kind of resources around me. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t, so I have to look a my neighbors and area in a different light<br/>
&gt; or just search out further. There are people here who have different<br/>
&gt; talents and specialties to offer and occasionally we run across<br/>
&gt; another &quot;freak in the woods&quot;. It helps that my husband&#39;s parents who<br/>
&gt; live 500 ft. away are fairly interesting people--lots of collected<br/>
&gt; junk and books to tinker with and enjoy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son is involved in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Civil Air Patrol, but my daughter has no social outlets here. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I find the internet (and the inter-library loan system of books) very<br/>
&gt; important for me in my remoteness. It brings me close to friends who<br/>
&gt; are far way as well as has been a ways of finding new friends in my<br/>
&gt; area and beyond.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It has been a way for me to find out about many local opportunities<br/>
&gt; for fun and learning for my son (Though we haven&#39;t done much as of<br/>
&gt; yet. Once my husband gets a truck for his work and I have a car I can<br/>
&gt; use every day, there will be more.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Finances and the fact that we own eight (yes, eight) dogs interferes<br/>
&gt; &gt; with us going too far away from home.  We are quite isolated.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You said you can&#39;t travel much. Have you considered sending your kids<br/>
&gt; somewhere: to visit a brother or another relative or to a retreat of<br/>
&gt; some kind--maybe as counselors, so it won&#39;t cost so much. You can also<br/>
&gt; just explore and visit places your area on day or day and a half<br/>
&gt; trips, perhaps?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is always difficult for me and my almost 3 year old to get up and<br/>
&gt; go somewhere like Shreveport or other nearby towns. We have a special<br/>
&gt; diet, so I have to prepared meals for us on the road. I have thought<br/>
&gt; about making a goal for at least one fun trip to the city a week.<br/>
&gt; Money is very tight right now, so we are worried about how much the<br/>
&gt; gas will cost for too much driving. I am optimistic though that we or<br/>
&gt; he will find the opportunities and resources that are needed when the<br/>
&gt; time comes, even though to outward seeming I live in an area devoid of<br/>
&gt; culture and interest.<br/>

&gt; least they will know more about what they DON&#39;T like. While they are<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
 Thanks for writing.  I feel bad for the circumstances you are living<br/>
in, but it&#39;s nice to know that there is someone else out there that is<br/>
in almost the same situation.  Sometimes it feels like there is no<br/>
light at the end of the tunnel.  I don&#39;t know if you believe in God<br/>
and I hope I don&#39;t offend you, but I&#39;ve decided to focus my energy on<br/>
Him and allow Him to take care of the rest.<br/>
  Unfortunately, I live in Winchester, VA which is quite far from you.<br/>
 If you have any other thoughts on unschooling, please let me know for<br/>
I need lots of ideas and reassurance.  It makes a lot of sense to me,<br/>
but I feel like everyone else knows what they are doing and has more<br/>
resources, etc., etc.  I quess I feel like if they really knew my<br/>
situation they&#39;d tell me that what I am doing is wrong for us.<br/>
  Once again, thanks a lot for writing and good luck with your<br/>
unschooling experience.<br/>
