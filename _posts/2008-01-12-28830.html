 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s easier to approach that by knowing that an unschooled person  <br/>
*doesn&#39;t* have an equivalent education. What they have is life  <br/>
experience which is even better.<br/>
<br/>
School is a way of artificially dividing up the world into pieces so  <br/>
it can be fed efficiently to a room full of kids by one person in a  <br/>
way it can be tested. School was designed as a way to raise the  <br/>
education level of the masses when the US had a huge influx of  <br/>
untrained immigrants who didn&#39;t speak English. It was never designed  <br/>
to raise every person up to college material. But schools have been  <br/>
trying to use a system that wasn&#39;t designed for that task to do that  <br/>
for decades.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is learning naturally, organically, what you need to do  <br/>
what interests you.<br/>
<br/>
Which is a long way of saying that a unschooled person, like a  <br/>
homeschooled person, fills in the &quot;Level of Education&quot; with  <br/>
homeschool graduate and then &quot;Experience&quot; with volunteer and paying  <br/>
jobs and projects related to the job that they&#39;ve had.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Colleges work with what they&#39;re given. They sort high school students  <br/>
by grades because that&#39;s what they have to work with.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s what they want. They really don&#39;t want a  <br/>
herd of applicants who have sat in chairs doing what they&#39;re told for  <br/>
12 years who will expect to continue the same for the next 4 years.<br/>
<br/>
Colleges really like older students who have been out in the work  <br/>
force and are in college not because it&#39;s what you do after high  <br/>
school but because they want to be there to further their knowledge  <br/>
in a particular field that they already know they like.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids can also take community college courses in subjects  <br/>
that interest them. That&#39;s a good way of showing someone is capable  <br/>
of college level work.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ironic but the Ivy League and top tier colleges are more likely  <br/>
know what to do with a homeschooled application than the lower tier  <br/>
colleges just because they&#39;re more likely to see them. Ivy Leagues  <br/>
like unschoolers because they&#39;re hungry for knowledge and haven&#39;t  <br/>
been burdened down by classes for the past 12 years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777282486">I wanted to add on to this, because I just read a journal article stating that 35% of high <br/>
school graduates who attend college are capable of attending college classes. 70% of <br/>
those will attempt college, but those who aren&#39;t prepared are taking remedial classes. And <br/>
over 50% of THOSE students will drop out of college.<br/>
<br/>
Someone was arguing with me that to attend college you have to have all sorts of high <br/>
classes, like Calculus I and II, advanced forms of physics, years and years of foreign <br/>
languge etc. Basically all the stuff that high schools sell as part of their curriculum. But <br/>
that&#39;s not true. Or else why would colleges offer beginning math, basic chemistry, <br/>
beginning foreign language. I never understood that, and don&#39;t get me started on <br/>
freshman english, with few exceptions that was the biggest waste of my time. lol!<br/>
<br/>
Now compare that to homeschooling.70% of homeschool graduates will go to college, and <br/>
the drop out rate is so minimal, that the article didn&#39;t even have a number. Unschoolers, as  <br/>
well, will do better in college for all the reasons that Joyce enumerated. If they go to <br/>
college, they WANT to go. They spend the time getting ready. And then, if they take <br/>
remedial classes, there is no stigma attached as there is for public school kids, because <br/>
they are there to LEARN...it&#39;s what they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
unschooled kids who want to go to college will self study to take the ACT. They&#39;ll start <br/>
community college at 16. They&#39;ll mentor under a occupation that they love. A dozen ways <br/>
to get started into tertiary education, and in a society in which every single high school <br/>
grad comes in with the same transcript, something new and different like an unschoolers <br/>
portfolio is going to catch attention in the admissions department.<br/>

Stanford U&#39;s alumni magazine.  The article was about the increase of <br/>
homeschoolers attending Stanford.  They interviewed the admissions <br/>
director (I think that was his title) and he said that it has become <br/>
clearer and clearer to colleges across the nation that things like <br/>
SAT scores are not great predictors of how well a student will do in <br/>
college.  He said that there is something that admissions directors <br/>
look for in prospective students that is not easily discribed or <br/>
quantified, but that it was like a spark--an independence toward <br/>
their learning.  He said that when he saw that, he knew that student <br/>
would be successful in college.  He also said that few high school <br/>
students had it, but that every homeschooled student he ever met <br/>
with  had it!<br/>
<br/>
As more and more colleges open themselves up to homeschooled <br/>
students and stop requiring tests to get in, I think we are going to <br/>
see a change in our higher education systems (for the better)--and <br/>
hopefully that will cause systematic change in how our society views <br/>
education (all kinds of education--not just that which comes from a <br/>
school building).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443080760">Before I started unschooling, I read a lot about Sudbury Valley School<br/>
in Sudbury, MA. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sudval.org/index.html">http://www.sudval.org/index.html</a> ) This is a free or<br/>
democratic school, where kids are free to choose what they do every<br/>
day. They do go to the school itself, and are expected to spend a<br/>
minimum number of hours there each week. The school does not provide<br/>
any kind of transcript or evaluation of its students. No letters of<br/>
recommendation.<br/>
<br/>
It is up to the students to do what&#39;s necessary to get into college,<br/>
if that&#39;s something they want to pursue. No graduate of Sudbury has<br/>
failed to get into the college of their choice. The school has been in<br/>
operation for 40 years now, and they have tons of data about their<br/>
graduates, surveys and statistics, etc. Sudbury is NOT unschooling -<br/>
parents are minimally involved in the school - but their research and<br/>
work always reassured me in my early days.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an article written about college, from the Sudbury perspective:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sudval.org/05_alumni.html#04">http://www.sudval.org/05_alumni.html#04</a>  It&#39;s quite long, but there&#39;s<br/>
a lot of great stuff to consider in the article.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322649367">~~How do you convince an employer?~~<br/>
<br/>
By being the most employable. Seriously...what do companies want? A<br/>
person with good grades or a person with real life experience that<br/>
helps them do the job? I&#39;ve beat out degreed candidates at many jobs. <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are DOING the things that interest them. People that DO<br/>
are much more employable in my opinion. I could list all the<br/>
unschoolers I know that are doing work in a job they love, but would<br/>
that even convince anyone? I could list the jobs I&#39;ve worked where<br/>
I&#39;ve been employed over people with degrees (over 50 of them in one<br/>
case) but would that convince anyone?<br/>
<br/>
I think you have to shift your thinking in order for this to make<br/>
sense. Convincing people that college and jobs are able to be pursued<br/>
is so far from my thinking I can&#39;t even spend time doing it. If<br/>
someone thinks an unschooler can&#39;t go to college or get a job, then<br/>
they shouldn&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
Once you see that learning is a lifelong process, then college or jobs<br/>
are not even relevant discussion material. It all depends on the<br/>
individual. I know unschooling families where the parents don&#39;t have<br/>
jobs. I know an unschooler who chose to be homeless for several months<br/>
as part of his learning experiences. Are they any more or less<br/>
successful than someone like Laurie Chancey, a grown unschooler who<br/>
will have her PHD shortly? I think not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes and no -- depends on the college, of course!  The college my ds<br/>
wants to attend DOES require at least 2 years of a foreign language. <br/>
We are meeting that by having done intense study (with a tutor) to<br/>
prepare for the second semester at the local college (in their<br/>
high-schoolers at college type of program that so many schools now<br/>
seem to have) to prove he has had those years.  (One semester of<br/>
college language is considered the equivalent of a year of high school<br/>
language.)  The reason that even at schools where foreign language is<br/>
a requirement that beginning foreign languages are offered is that<br/>
some students will want to take more than one language.  Just because<br/>
you had Spanish in high school doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s all you want!<br/>
<br/>
For some colleges - especially techy-oriented ones like MIT and<br/>
CalTech -- they DO require some calc before admission.  No remedial<br/>
math there.  But remedial math courses in college (which, btw, do not<br/>
count towards graduation credits usually) are more apt to be taken by<br/>
those who are planning on majoring in something other than math or<br/>
science.  And generally don&#39;t need boatloads of math and science. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s also helpful to ask yourself what the college&#39;s reasons are for  <br/>
the requirement.<br/>
<br/>
What percentage of people who attended a college requiring 2 years of  <br/>
a foreign language ever needed that foreign language for the classes  <br/>
in their field? Spanish was useless to me. (Though Chinese or Hindi  <br/>
might have helped so I could understand the Teaching Assistants! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I asked the woman who worked in admissions at Smith College. She said  <br/>
it was to broaden the student and expose them to a culture.<br/>
<br/>
A pretty prestigious school and a pretty lame answer, I thought. They  <br/>
require it just because they always have and at one time it probably  <br/>
made sense. Latin and Greek did make sense when classical education  <br/>
was the rule.<br/>
<br/>
So think about the equivalent of 2 years of high school Spanish. I  <br/>
can think of way better ways to learn about a culture than sitting in  <br/>
a class room declining Spanish verbs.<br/>

dh and I think it is a rather idiotic requirement -- and if we could<br/>
get away with letting him study it on his own and counting that good<br/>
enough, we would.  We know he is unlikely to use it later in life --<br/>
though you never know.  But they require it, and require that the<br/>
level be verified, either by SAT-II, AP, or having the second semester<br/>
college course work.  The first two, from what I&#39;ve read/researched,<br/>
are far harder -- so he is learning the first semester&#39;s worth with a<br/>
tutor, almost ready now, and will take the second semester at the<br/>
local U starting in a week.  <br/>
<br/>
What a computer programmer will need with two semesters of French, I<br/>
dunno... but he wants this particular college, and that is the ONLY<br/>
impediment.  So, he will learn it to be able to go where he wants.<br/>

I could ask all I want, but it wouldn&#39;t change their requirements. ~~<br/>
<br/>
Another myth.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I learned from John Taylor Gatto, is that most EVERY<br/>
college will let you prove &quot;requirements&quot; in a number of creative<br/>
ways. Also, something most people don&#39;t even realize (and colleges<br/>
don&#39;t want you to know) is that you can &quot;uncollege&quot; in a sense. <br/>
<br/>
Rather than going to the required courses, you can find out all the<br/>
required classes for a certain degree or program and come up with your<br/>
OWN plan for learning those required topics. Most colleges will accept<br/>
your plan, in lieu of showing up to classes and you save a LOT of<br/>
money. It takes determination, creativity and the ability to<br/>
self-direct. But it&#39;s been done many times.<br/>
<br/>
How you choose to learn the material is up to you...then just take the<br/>
final tests to prove you&#39;ve learned what they want you to learn. Saves<br/>
money and time and lets a person learn in the method that best works<br/>
for them. Plus you have the benefit of not showing up to class.:)<br/>
Finding out what they require, the books they use, what is on the test<br/>
is all you really need to create your own college experience.<br/>
<br/>
Getting out of entry &quot;requirements&quot; happens all the time too. It&#39;s not<br/>
as cut and dry as people seem to believe. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>And it&#39;s possible to bone up on your own and test out of up to 1 1/2 <br/>
semesters worth of work - the CLEP exams. DH took them when he started <br/>
college (at age 27) in order to get out of the tedious 101 classes <br/>
(math, science, composition, history, fine arts, etc). He said it was <br/>
about like answering Jeopardy questions. He took his ACT exam *after* <br/>
he was accepted, just because they needed it to check a checkbox (if he <br/>
had taken it ahead of time, he might&#39;ve gotten scholarship money he did <br/>
so well - who knew? lol) So, without an ACT exam, with barely passable <br/>
high school grades 10 years old (high school counselors said he <br/>
wasn&#39;t &quot;college material&quot;), he was accepted into a private university <br/>
and graduated in 4 yrs with a 3.00 GPA. He had found something he <br/>
loved, wanted to pursue, and a university setting put all the resources <br/>
he wanted right at hand. Not only did he get to skip those 101 classes, <br/>
save money on classes (the tests cost way less than a semester&#39;s worth <br/>
of tuition, fees, and books) but the space it left timewise in his <br/>
schedule allowed him to take other stuff entirely unrelated just <br/>
because it was interesting (like a radio broadcasting class).<br/>

be able to defer that requirement, and satisfy it by taking foreign<br/>
language once he was there.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect there is a lot of variance depending on the school.  At the<br/>
local U, my ds could EASILY get in, and DID get to avoid their idiotic<br/>
COMPASS exams to show he can handle the coursework he signed up for. <br/>
However, as a place for a good fit for him, it won&#39;t work long-term. <br/>
I&#39;d love it if it would, since it would be a lot cheaper, and he could<br/>
stay home.  But I have to look at his best interests, not my wants. <br/>
And he wants a good computer science school.  (That&#39;s a degree that<br/>
generally going beyond a BS is not valuable.  If he was interested in<br/>
a field where he needed a masters or better, where he got his<br/>
bachelors wouldn&#39;t matter so much.)<br/>
<br/>
As it was, for this one school, we had a hard time filling in their<br/>
computerized application -- too many boxes that didn&#39;t fit.  I ended<br/>
up calling for help there, too.  (And figured out a way to fudge to<br/>
fit.  While still maintaining the spirit of what he has done.)<br/>

<br/>
I think it can take more than just talking to someone to deal with<br/>
some of the creative methods of bypassing standard requirements. It<br/>
might take talking to many people, it might take an appointment with<br/>
the dean it might take more than that. It might not be worth it but<br/>
just because someone parrots back the requirement, it doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
there aren&#39;t other options.<br/>
<br/>
Colleges in the end, are about making money. As any good business<br/>
knows, you&#39;ve got to keep the customers happy in order to make money. <br/>
<br/>
The other factor here, is how set a person is on a certain college. If<br/>
the goal is to learn what you need, or gain a tool that you need, then<br/>
WHERE seems a bit less important. If the WHERE is very important to a<br/>
person, then they are probably ready to deal with whatever<br/>
requirements they need in order to get in.<br/>
<br/>
Attaining the requirements in the pre-described manner is rarely<br/>
necessary.<br/>

great.  But some do not.  (They might allow it for placement, might<br/>
not.)  Local U, accepts CLEP.  U of preference, doesn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
However, it DOES accept AP, so ds will have AP credit of nearly 1-2<br/>
semesters.  With other courses he has taken, probably will have credit<br/>
enough to be a sophomore shortly after starting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, gotta check that box, eh?  I&#39;m guessing you are more westerly<br/>
than easterly -- otherwise, it is more likely you would mention the<br/>
SAT!  (Seems to be a regional preference.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping ds will get some scholarship money.  Out of state tuition<br/>
is much heftier than instate, but we aren&#39;t moving for that!<br/>

<br/>

have a different sense of what they are there for.<br/>

Where do you think schools get actual diplomas?<br/>
<br/>
They *make* them!<br/>
<br/>
You can buy them at school supply stores. You can find them online. You <br/>
can design your own on your computer. You can buy parchment and <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
  Her main interest has always been animals and she&#39;s read and studied <br/>
so<br/>
many hours and resources on animals of all kinds.? Researched jobs <br/>

animals, participated in animal rescues from shelters and volunteered <br/>
at a<br/>
boarding/grooming place for a year, then apprenticed directly with the <br/>
groomer<br/>
in the shop and then on to the mobile grooming van for a year and now <br/>
is a paid<br/>
employee-grooming, office work, scheduling-anything the owner does she <br/>
can do.?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
A girl after my own heart. &lt;g&gt; I owned a salon and a mobile grooming <br/>
unit---LOVED the mobile!!! I still do a handful of hand-stripped <br/>
terriers and some poodles, but I&#39;ve whittled my client base down <br/>
considerably. I love doing it, but I don&#39;t like to be tied-down on <br/>
their schedules.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
(To buy this education would have cost $4000-then it would be &quot;real&quot; <br/>
but she<br/>
earned hers through grunt work and talent so its not as recognized as <br/>
&quot;school&quot;<br/>
or an &quot;education!&quot;)?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not true. It IS recognized as education. My guess is that she could <br/>
study a tiny bit and get her certification as a Master Groomer. If she <br/>
has the AKC handbook, it&#39;s simply a memorization process. Well, and the <br/>
practical side of grooming four dogs for them.<br/>
<br/>
But even so, you don&#39;t need that MG certificate. If you would sit down <br/>
and discuss all that she has learned---just from grooming (not to <br/>
mention all the other things she&#39;s done), it would look a bit like this:<br/>
<br/>
History & Science & Social Studies:<br/>
<br/>
Breeds and their origins. Form follows function: why were they <br/>
developed, so why they look as they do. (I know a lot about different <br/>
countries because of what breeds they developed where, when, and why. I <br/>
even knew where Afghanistan was when I was in fifth grade because I <br/>
adored the Afghan hound! &lt;G&gt; I also won a trivia question recently <br/>
because I knew where Ibiza was---and how to pronounce it---because of <br/>
the Ibizan hound.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Math:<br/>
<br/>
Proportion, Balance, Geometry<br/>
Accounting and keeping books<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She has studied extensively in the areas of holistic pet<br/>
care and holistic health (for people), aromatherapy, nutrition, <br/>
vegetarian &<br/>
vegan lifestyles, organic food and industry (clothing, etc)?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
All Health/Life Sciences/Biology related<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She does creative<br/>
writing and poetry-but none of it has been &quot;graded&quot; and in fact rarely <br/>
shared<br/>
with anyone-but does that decrease the value of the hours she has put <br/>
into it<br/>
(hundreds!)? She has had a poem published.?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not at all. Nothing needs to be graded. Grades are for meat and eggs, <br/>
not children!<br/>
<br/>
Give her &quot;credit&quot; for writing/composition---you don&#39;t need to give it a <br/>
letter grade.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 In conjuction with her creative<br/>
writing she has always enjoyed doing this &quot;fictional budget&quot; thing <br/>
thatt she<br/>

figures all of<br/>
these budgets from it.?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that would fall under Social Studies as ell as math. Pam, <br/>
could you label that in some way? Certainly Budgeting.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 that is where the majority of her math hours come<br/>
 from-but she used my husbands paycheck to figure % of pay for taxes, <br/>
insurance<br/>
etc and then used that % for her fictional paychecks, pays fictional <br/>
bills, ran<br/>
a fictional horse farm with employee paychecks and everything-very <br/>
involved and<br/>
detailed and I don&#39;t have a CLUE what to call it to give her &quot;school <br/>
credit&quot;..?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Math. Percentages. Book keeping. Accounting. Role Playing.<br/>
<br/>
School children NEVER do REAL accounting. It&#39;s ALL fictional. You <br/>
honestly can&#39;t penalize her simply because it wasn&#39;t a real horse farm.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She is able to run a household, care for siblings and cousins, cook, <br/>
she spent a<br/>
week alone last summer and worked and did just fine while we were out <br/>
of town<br/>
and numerous times has babysat over night for people.?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Social Studies. Life Sciences. Home Economics. Economics. Fractions. <br/>
Approximations.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s competent, mature,<br/>
intelligent and it aggravates me that b/c she&#39;s unschooled we have so <br/>
few tools<br/>
to define how awesome she is.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, you don&#39;t need to break it down. She seems fine. You could <br/>
easily make her a diploma.<br/>
<br/>
Below is a copy my sons&#39; curriculum. It is W-I-D-E open! You could <br/>
write something similar with *her* interests/hobbies/experiences in a <br/>
narrative if you feel the need.<br/>
<br/>
But if she&#39;s already employed, where&#39;s the necessity?<br/>

LifeWorks School for Boys<br/>
<br/>
Course of Study<br/>
Secondary Grades<br/>
<br/>
LifeWorks School for Boys is a private full-time homeschool established <br/>
in compliance with the Education Code of the State of South Carolina. <br/>
Because we believe that the family is the most fundamental social <br/>
institution and the preferred means of caring for, preparing, and <br/>
enabling children to be productive members of society, LifeWorks School <br/>
promotes and supports a family-centered education through our <br/>
independent study program.<br/>
<br/>
At LifeWorks School, we believe in independent study. Duncan will learn <br/>
primarily under the immediate direction, guidance, and support of his <br/>
parents and other caring and involved adults. We will offer an <br/>
outstanding educational opportunity by providing a natural learning <br/>
environment, extensive real-world experience, flexibility of schedule, <br/>
and the ability to respond to Duncan’s specific needs and inclinations. <br/>
Duncan’s program is developmentally appropriate, integrated and fully <br/>
individualized, and continually built upon his personal strengths and <br/>
interests throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
English: Duncan will develop knowledge of, and appreciation for <br/>
literature and the language, as well as the skills of speaking, <br/>
reading, listening, spelling, handwriting, and composition.<br/>
<br/>
He will read from self-chosen and parent-chosen literature on a regular <br/>
basis and will engage in reflection on those literature pieces in a <br/>
variety of ways, such as: journal writing, book reviews, conversations, <br/>
drama based on the books, book clubs. Our educational goal is for <br/>
Duncan to read for pleasure, to gain exposure to a wide variety of <br/>
genres, and to be able to reflect critically on what he reads.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan will read content-related non-fiction materials to support his <br/>
chosen areas of interest. He will reflect on these pieces in a variety <br/>
of ways, such as: journal writing, writing articles for submission to <br/>
magazines or newspapers, discussions, or development of a scrapbook in <br/>
an area of interest. Our goal is for Duncan to learn to read critically <br/>
for information, to understand and be able to reflect on materials <br/>
read, to be able to compare them to other sources of information, and <br/>
to learn how and where to find written resources as needed.<br/>
<br/>
Writing, spelling and grammar will be covered as part of Duncan’s <br/>
natural writing processes. He will develop his ability to write <br/>
creatively, to write letters and lists, to create and write drama <br/>
pieces, informational essays, persuasive articles, etc. Our goal is for <br/>
Duncan to enjoy writing, to gain expertise in both the writing process <br/>
and in technical writing and editing skills, and to develop a sense of <br/>
power over the written word.<br/>
<br/>
Science: Duncan will develop his scientific knowledge with emphasis on <br/>
basic concepts, theories, and processes of scientific investigation and <br/>
on the place of humans in ecological systems, and with appropriate <br/>
applications of the interrelation and interdependence of the sciences. <br/>
These will be related to areas of his personal interest by engaging in <br/>
hands-on activities, watching science videos, reading related written <br/>
materials, conducting scientific experiments, keeping journals, making <br/>
and recording observations, visiting scientists in their work places, <br/>
visiting local science museums, participating in science fairs and <br/>
workshops, or through cooperative learning. Our goal is for Duncan to <br/>
experience a wide range of scientific exposure in his areas of <br/>
interest, to develop a positive interest in science, to learn to think <br/>
scientifically, to develop a respect for the work scientists do, and to <br/>
understand the importance science has in daily life.<br/>
<br/>

political science, and sociology are fully integrated into the his <br/>
studies in a wide variety of ways, such as: the use of time lines and <br/>
maps, discussion, journal writing, cooking, plays, road trips, <br/>
invention building, field trips, and art. Our goal is for Duncan to <br/>

development, and government of South Carolina and the United States of <br/>
America; the American legal system; the operation of the juvenile and <br/>
adult criminal justice systems and the rights and duties of citizens <br/>

fully integrated as a part of daily living skills and participation in <br/>
the wider community. Duncan will learn to care for his health and <br/>

preparing food, discussing the necessity of a healthy diet, <br/>
participation in fire drills and other emergency preparedness <br/>
activities, exercise both as play and as part of a structured group <br/>
experience and through camping, hiking, and other outdoor activity. Our <br/>

education, industrial arts, general business education, and general <br/>
agriculture will be offered in a variety of ways. Duncan’s interests <br/>
will determine the direction of his applied arts and vocation projects, <br/>

future vocational and avocational requirements.<br/>

have influenced music through history, or working on individualized or <br/>
group projects that relate to music, art, and drama, including acting <br/>
and performing in a variety of venues and genres.  Our goal is for <br/>
Duncan to enjoy a wide variety of art, music, and drama experiences, <br/>
including performance, while developing an understanding and <br/>
appreciation of the importance of art, music, and drama as creative <br/>
expressions of human life experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Mathematics: Duncan will develop mathematical concepts, operational <br/>
skills, and problem solving through participation in daily real-world <br/>
activities such as cooking, building, shopping, budgeting, computing, <br/>
etc. Mathematics materials will be chosen to support his individual <br/>
learning style in order to achieve competency in operational skills and <br/>
insight into problem-solving procedures.  Our goal is for Duncan to <br/>
gain a strong conceptual knowledge of mathematics as well as an <br/>
appreciation for the daily applications of mathematics in his life.<br/>
<br/>

develop the knowledge and skills necessary to become a safe driver.<br/>

understanding, speaking, reading, and writing skills in a foreign <br/>
language(s) of his choice.<br/>

We live in Missouri.? This is my question too?? Any help on putting<br/>
together a<br/>
grad portfolio? or transcript? or what???? Mine is 16, done with school<br/>
(per se)<br/>

actual<br/>
diploma-we don&#39;t want to do a GED.?<br/>

I am going with this option to graduate my 16 year old. It is a bit of<br/>
an expense, but for our family, it is worth it.<br/>
