<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316640500">I enjoyed reading the comments written in by readers! One comment that<br/>
hit me was when the child asks &quot;Where do carrots come from?&quot; and the<br/>
reader posted that you can take the seeds out in the backyard and bury<br/>
it in the ground.Oh how silly of me that was in school. <br/>
But in reality if a child asks,Where do carrots come from? They would<br/>
be told &quot; Oh sweetie today we are working on this. You will learn<br/>
about that in next years curriculum.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for sharing-I found the article to be informative and helpful. <br/>
I&#39;m still not certain what unschooling is and is not, but the freedom <br/>
for my daughter to learn what she is interested in is wonderful. As <br/>
her mother, seeing the return of her joy in learning is so rewarding. <br/>
I saw her confidence and creativity squashed in traditional schools, <br/>
and am finding this to be a relief that dd doen&#39;t have to be cut from <br/>
the same cookie cutter as  everone else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866161326">I really enjoyed the article.  My only complaint would be by the end, <br/>
  they tend to make it sound a bit like unschooling is for delayed learners. <br/>
  At the dentist office the other day, jaws dropped when I told <br/>
  them we didn&#39;t need a note for school.  The clerk asked if homeschooling<br/>
  was really hard to do.  When I told her not at all, we unschool, everyone <br/>
  turned and stared at us, &quot; Oh, what&#39;s wrong with him?&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  I find that a bit offensive.  Still being somewhat new to unschooling, I felt<br/>
  the need to point out that there&#39;s nothing &#39;wrong&#39; with him. My son is very<br/>
  advanced and ahead of his same aged peers.   Unschooling gives him<br/>
  freedom to learn at his pace which is much faster then the school system.<br/>
   <br/>
  Vicki who is learning to unschool herself, lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341185174">Hi Vicki,<br/>
<br/>
While we were camping, a few people asked about my daughter being in <br/>
school, and I explained we were schooling at home. The responses were <br/>
very positive, but I&#39;m sure that if I had said &#39;unschooling&#39;, I&#39;d have <br/>
gotten some puzzled looks. Rather than becoming offended, less than <br/>
positive responses are a great opportuity to explain what unschooling <br/>
is, and the differences of a home education.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get the impression from the article that unschooling is for <br/>
the learning challanged. I thought the article pointed out that <br/>
unschooling can be for learners of all abilities. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099966765">ROFL Danette  my kids and I were just discussing this yesterday (and<br/>
I hadn&#39;t read the article so it was unrelated)  where do carrots come<br/>
from (they&#39;re almost 4 and 6.5).  My DD remembered DH&#39;s garden from<br/>
the last few years and piped up, &quot;you put seeds in the ground&quot;. <br/>
Thinking about that myself brought up my own question  &quot;OK, but where<br/>
do the seeds come from?  When the carrots are harvested, they don&#39;t<br/>
have seeds on them.&quot;  I had to look it up.  I wonder how many<br/>
elementary kids could answer THAT.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
The answer, in case I&#39;ve piqued your interest (and you got as *great*<br/>
an education as I did in public schoollol):<br/>
Most of us never get a chance to see carrot seeds, however, because<br/>
the plant is usually pulled out of the ground before it produces them.<br/>
We harvest carrots in their first year so we can eat the tasty orange<br/>
root, but carrots are biennialsthey produce seeds in their second year.<br/>
<br/>
As I was reading the article this morning, this quote struck me - &quot;If<br/>
they&#39;re focused on one area, the child may know everything about<br/>
gardening but won&#39;t know multiplication tables.&quot;  I literally laughed<br/>
out loud.  How ludicrous to think that you can learn *anything* about<br/>
gardening and it not turn into a math and numbers game!! LOL  Just<br/>
shows how flat and stagnant the education system has become in their<br/>
thoughts.  Same with this quote - &quot;My 11-year-old, given his druthers,<br/>
would never do spelling and always do math.&quot;  At the very least, if he<br/>
loves math THAT much, some day he will have to learn to read and<br/>
therefore, spell, in order to learn more math.  It&#39;s just amazing that<br/>
people don&#39;t see it.  What can we do to explain this better to people??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391047740">Hi Candy,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also in Arizona, in Tucson, and I unschool my 2 kids, ages 11 & 8.  I<br/>
suggest letting go of the Virtual Academy.  It doesn&#39;t sound like it is<br/>
working for either you or your son.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I dont know where to start because Jordan is so turned off by school right<br/>
now&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can start by taking a &quot;vacation&quot; from school.  Do fun stuff with your<br/>
kids.  More art, more playing, take walks, kick soccer balls around, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I am afraid he will not WANT to learn on his own&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Recognize that your son already IS learning, every day, all the time.  So<br/>
what if he doesn&#39;t know the difference between nouns and verbs.  Who cares?<br/>
He can communicate, right?  So he can use them in real life.  Being able to<br/>
label them isn&#39;t important except in school and in testing situations.<br/>
Especially at age 6.  So you can relax &lt;g&gt; and just go about enjoying life.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to find a local support group.  Where in Arizona are you?<br/>
You also might be interested in the HENA conference later this month in<br/>
Phoenix.  Here is their website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hena.us/">http://hena.us/</a><br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am afraid he will not WANT to learn on his own<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He probably will want to avoid activities that resemble school  <br/>
learning because he has a negative association with them. If you put  <br/>
no pressure on him, he will recover and so-called educational  <br/>
activities will lose the taint.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s just a tiny portion of what and ways he can learn.<br/>
<br/>
Though don&#39;t expect unschooling to look like school. It&#39;s a rare  <br/>
unschooling kid who picks up workbooks for fun. But they will *use*  <br/>
the skills through living life that schools try to pour into them and  <br/>
get better at the skills and pick up more knowledge as a side effect  <br/>
of using them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and he has a grasp on reading but is not perfect at it yet<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why does he need to be perfect at it right now? How will reading well  <br/>
enhance him being 6 years old?<br/>
<br/>
Schools have parents so terrified that if their kids aren&#39;t reading  <br/>
well early that they&#39;re doomed to be poor readers.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is they&#39;re likely to be poor readers *because of* school,  <br/>
not because they&#39;re not reading early. Being in an environment where  <br/>
there&#39;s pressure to do what you can&#39;t yet, and messages that you&#39;re  <br/>
defective because you aren&#39;t doing something that &quot;everyone else&quot; is,  <br/>
is what causes reading problems.<br/>
<br/>
Kids naturally learn to read typically between 4 and 12. By 15,  <br/>
though, you can&#39;t tell who read earlier and who read later. A 12 year  <br/>
old who has just decoded the code for reading isn&#39;t 6 years behind  <br/>
one who decoded the code at 6. The 12 year old quickly catches up to  <br/>
his or her age mates because all the other brain areas that are  <br/>
needed for reading were developing and being used for other things  <br/>
and just waiting for the last piece to kick in. There&#39;s a lot of  <br/>
stories of kids going from non-reading to reading adult level books  <br/>
practically overnight.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he doesnt know nouns and verbs etc, I just couldnt get him to  <br/>
&gt; understand that concept yet and I get worried he wont be smart as  <br/>
&gt; an adult<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why does he need nouns and verbs right now? Why do you fear that just  <br/>
because he can&#39;t understand now, he won&#39;t understand 5 years from now?<br/>
<br/>
Why do you associate knowing nouns and verbs as being smart? You  <br/>
don&#39;t need to tell us. Just think about it. We&#39;re all chock full of  <br/>
inconsistencies that clog up clear thinking! It takes a while to  <br/>
recognize them and hold them up to the light of day to examine them  <br/>
closely.<br/>
<br/>
If you think of people you know in real life who you consider smart,  <br/>
would you think they were less smart if they didn&#39;t know nouns and  <br/>
verbs even though they used them properly all the time in speaking?<br/>
