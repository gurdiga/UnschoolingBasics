<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756012363">Today is a beautiful crisp winter day with the sun shining! We still<br/>
have bits and pieces of snow patches to make the golden rays twinkle<br/>
like magic faery dust. Oh the sunshine helps me sooo much.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I lay (crap, is it lay or laid, I never have figured that<br/>
one out) awake worrying about how this morning would go. I have many<br/>
personal issues with what I believe about this popular holiday from<br/>
not only the religious aspect but also the materialistic, traditional<br/>
and what is the right thing to do about Santa. SOOOOOOOOO...........<br/>
<br/>
I took deep breaths and tried to *feel* abundance, but that feeling is<br/>
strange and unfamiliar to me. I don&#39;t recall ever feeling *enough*<br/>
without the feeling of *but not for long*. I thought peace. I could<br/>
feel peace. I thought love. I could feel love. But I don&#39;t have any<br/>
memory of abundance. I will make one. Sooooooooooo.........<br/>
<br/>
I imagined what I thought abundance might feel like. Is this *right*?<br/>
Is this what real abundance feels like? I don&#39;t know..... but I also<br/>
don&#39;t care. It feels way better than unabundance. In time real<br/>
abundance will be in my *now* because I will know what it feels like,<br/>
but for this moment, I will create abundance for Megan and Sophia and<br/>
Brandon.Sooooo....<br/>
<br/>
This morning was wonderful. Everyone felt full of fullness, full of<br/>
love, full of peace, and yes....also full of presents that they were<br/>
very happy with, even Sophia who seems to need *more* of most things<br/>
to feel full had abundance in her day.<br/>
<br/>
Peace, Light and Joy to you<br/>
<br/>

Ah...that is wonderful. Thanks for sharing about your struggle and<br/>
your Christmas morning.<br/>
<br/>
I had my own meltdown this week. I have this image of the &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>
Christmas stamped into my brain by the three women most influential in<br/>
my life..my mother, my aunt and my maternal grandmother. They had some<br/>
fierce victorian ideals and our Christmas as children were pretty<br/>
decadent. Lots of amazing food (I&#39;m talking tons of handmade, baked,<br/>
beautiful foods) gifts, people etc...<br/>
<br/>
Our Christmas here has most often been without family and this year I<br/>
was struggling with feelings of &quot;not enough&quot;. I KNOW logically that I<br/>
connect more with my children than the adults in my life did. I KNOW<br/>
that playing games with them and reading together and all those lovely<br/>
things are what is important. But because I couldn&#39;t provide the<br/>
decadent meal (it was still pretty fabulous if I say so) and the TONS<br/>
of gifts I was feeling this terrific lack.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing logically where it stems from, didn&#39;t stop the feeling. Then<br/>
there was this really intense grief that hit me, where I was missing<br/>
my mother&#39;s incredible way of connecting and honoring her<br/>
grandchildren. She baked with them and bought them amazing gifts that<br/>
were very personal. She really made the holidays awesome for us.<br/>
<br/>
I had a good cry in the bathroom, felt sorry for myself and working<br/>
through that process ended up feeling pretty good. We had a very<br/>
low-key and wonderful day. In spite of Jalen throwing up last night,<br/>
in spite of dh feeling under the weather today, Christmas was perfect<br/>
and beautiful. Perfectly imperfect right? I am exactly where I need to<br/>
be and the day was exactly what we needed.:) I am surrounded by people<br/>
I love more than anything and we have all  that we need. The kids are<br/>
happily playing with their Christmas toys and I realize how incredible<br/>
this life really is.<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone had joy and connections today, like every day and can<br/>
feel abundance all around. Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798715288">Thanks Ren,<br/>
<br/>
We had a very wonderful Christmas here, too.  <br/>
Just my spouse and kids, then off to work I went.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I had my &#39;great day of tears&#39; as my spouse<br/>
just learned that the lower section of his lungs appear<br/>
&#39;stuck together&#39;.  (He had been rushed to the ER)<br/>
We&#39;ll get the results of the cat scan in four more days...  <br/>
<br/>
He seems to be handling it well by loving our kids for all<br/>
their worth.  Makes you think about just what is important.<br/>

<br/>
Because this was our first Christmas without my mother, we had a very <br/>
low key day today, choosing to spend a quiet and refective day close to <br/>
home. My husband made lasagna for the first time (it was great!) and we <br/>
did some crafts and played a lot of board games (Connect 4, Pay Day, <br/>
Clue and Othello). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575323813">Sorry, I am behind a little.  Congrats on the great morning.  I can&#39;t say<br/>
the same.  I am used to being surrounded by family and of course food and<br/>
some presents.  Well, we had the &quot;some presents&quot; and some food, but I<br/>
struggled with the family aspect. My BIL was at our house with his Wii so<br/>
all dh wanted to do was play that with his brother whom he rarely sees.  My<br/>
girls just wanted to play video games too.  In fact, presents didn&#39;t even<br/>
hold their attention.  I dealt with it, which basically means I pushed my<br/>
feelings aside.<br/>
<br/>
I am better now, but I was being a HUGE martyr.  How sad for my family.<br/>
