<div id="ygrps-yiv-746372942">Well it&#39;s night time but I thought I&#39;d post anyway...I like this <br/>
thread! My 9 y.o. son and husband are taking turns building an <br/>
amusement park on Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. Earlier my son was <br/>
painting the shield he is making for a Boy Scout project (it has a <br/>
snake on it, one of his favorite creatures, and he made sure to <br/>
point out to us that he painted the snake using 2 colors of green). <br/>
They were also tossing around ideas for a play they will do in their <br/>
den, all the boys will have their home-made swords and shields, so <br/>
I&#39;m sure it will be a play with alot of ACTION! I was out at the <br/>
time picking up a humane trap at a neighbor&#39;s house, we are working <br/>
on spaying/neutering a colony of feral cats in our neighborhood (but <br/>
that&#39;s a story for another list....) When I got home my son wanted <br/>
to know how the trap worked so we set it and baited it and let one <br/>
of our cats show us how to get trapped in it...and then <br/>
released...no harm done...he is a tolerant cat!<br/>
Earlier today my son and I watched &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; since he has <br/>
been interested in Knights and Dragons etc. ever since playing &quot;Fire <br/>
Emblem Sacred Stones&quot; on his gameboy. He talks all about Druids, and <br/>
Knights and weapons...I&#39;ve also rented Princess Bride and I want to <br/>
find Dragonheart to go along with this theme.... Before that he was <br/>
building Bionicles, he was matching them up by color with his <br/>
marbles and posing them around the livingroom. I was helping him <br/>
take pictures with the digital camera and later we&#39;ll make an album <br/>
with the photos. Gee...I guess we really do keep busy during the <br/>
day...to top off the night we&#39;ll continue reading from the Murderous <br/>
Maths series (my son loves these, but he insists we read them <br/>
together, right now we&#39;re on &quot;Do you Feel Lucky? The Secrets of <br/>
Probability!&quot;. Too bad I didn&#39;t get the Ben Franklin coin flip email <br/>
until too late, or we would have done that too!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
