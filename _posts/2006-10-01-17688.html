<div id="ygrps-yiv-923335183">I just finished posting Unschooling Voices #4 and I&#39;d like to invite <br/>
all of you to take a look. :-) This months optional question was <br/>
about math. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/2006/10/unschooling-voices-">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/2006/10/unschooling-voices-</a><br/>
4.html<br/>
<br/>
If the link doesn&#39;t work, go to the Unschooling Voices main page and <br/>
scroll down until you see &quot;October&quot;. From that main page you can <br/>
also catch up on past editions and get information on how you can <br/>
submit your thoughts. :-) You don&#39;t need a blog...just some <br/>
unschooling thoughts swirling around your head. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link to the main page:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.foreverparents.com/UnschoolingVoices.html">http://www.foreverparents.com/UnschoolingVoices.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The new (always optional) question for the month is:<br/>
On the topic of support in unschooling...how much do you have from <br/>
family & friends? Are there other unschoolers near you or do you <br/>
belong to an offline unschooling group? How important is having that <br/>
support? <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to answer it here, please reply to this message (so <br/>
Unschooling Voices stays in the subject line) that way I can find <br/>
it...or feel free to e-mail it directly to me. You&#39;ll find the UV e-<br/>
mail address at the link to the main page. <br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did. :-)<br/>
