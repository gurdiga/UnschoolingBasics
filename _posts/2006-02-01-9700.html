Unfortunately, we&#39;re not too close to the conferences you mentioned, <br/>
but I would love to make it one. However, we&#39;re moving back to Oregon <br/>
in a couple of months, and I know Grace Llewelyn has the &quot;not back to <br/>
school camp&quot; there every year. My son still has a couple of years <br/>
before he can go (it&#39;s for 13+), but he&#39;s already looking forward to <br/>
it. There&#39;s also a week-long unschooling coastal camping trip every <br/>
year in Oregon, so that should be fun.<br/>

Where in Oregon are you moving? I live in Corvallis and we have a growing unschooling/homeschooling group here. My son is going to Not Back To School Camp and we have friends who go to the Unschooling Chautauqua you mentioned.<br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>
