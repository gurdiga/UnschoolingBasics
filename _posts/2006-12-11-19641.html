<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589010358">There&#39;s a new group, PanamaUnschoolers, created for unschoolers either <br/>
currently living in Panama or considering a move there. Expats and <br/>
native Panamanians welcome!<br/>
<br/>
If you know of any unschooling families who fit this description, <br/>
please forward this to them!<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PanamaUnschoolers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PanamaUnschoolers/</a><br/>
<br/>
This is not to take away from any other group, but just to help <br/>
unschoolers in Panama (or interested in Panama) find each other for <br/>
support, playgroups, field trips, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Chelsea</div>
