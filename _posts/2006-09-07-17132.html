<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783378320">Hi everyone!  We have been back since Monday evening and I am JUST now<br/>
getting a chance to check in.  Boy and I glad I went &quot;No Mail&quot; cuz I would<br/>
feel like I have to read every digest I received while I was gone...lol  I<br/>
won&#39;t go into details here (will write in my blog when I have more time) but<br/>
I highly recommend people start planning to attend next years Rethinking<br/>
Education (www.rethinkingeducation.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rethinkingeducation.com/">http://www.rethinkingeducation.com/</a>&gt;<br/>
) conference NOW!  It was soooo wonderful to be surrounded by parents and<br/>
grandparents (and hotel staff) that have the utmost respect for children.<br/>
Hope everyone had a wonderful and safe Labor Day weekend!<br/>
 <br/>

Hi Christy!<br/>
Glad you had a great experience!   Maybe you can share some of it!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of everyone in NM this week, wishing I was there, <br/>
hopefully next year (sounds like it MIGHT be back on the east coast)!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-174819790">Greetings, everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a lurker for a bit, really curious about unschooling.  I was also<br/>
at the RE conference, and I also have to say that it was fantastic!  Someone<br/>
mentioned recently that &quot;it was like someone installed a sun roof in my<br/>
head.&quot;  Wonderful atmosphere, great kids, and a lot of dads.  There was even<br/>
a couple of Dad&#39;s meetings at night, and I got so much out of that as well.<br/>
