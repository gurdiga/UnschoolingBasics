<h4>PAULA PARMENTER</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531213926">We have had our Madagascar Hissing Cockroach for almost a year. We got her when she was a baby and named her Hoover (&#39;cause she vacuums up her food!). We feed her vegetables and insect food called &quot;Bug Bites&quot; by Nature Zone. We have a lot of pets (a &quot;family zoo&quot;) and she is one of my favorite animals. The first time she hissed at me,I was so startled because I did not expect her to be soooooo LOUD!!! lol<br/>
