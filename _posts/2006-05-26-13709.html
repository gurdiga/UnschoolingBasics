<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948629077">Today as I was preparing for opening day at the marina I was making sugar <br/>
water (for mixing shaved ice flavors) and ds(5) wanted to try some straight <br/>
sugar.  So I pulled out a spoon and let him scoop up a bite (big step for <br/>
me, esp if any of you remember my first post to UD, and reprimand form <br/>
Sandra =) ).  Tried it, claimed he loved it and that was that.  Didn&#39;t ask <br/>
for more.  A few moments ago when sis(7) got home a conversation something <br/>
like this followed:<br/>
<br/>
ds: Hey Rho, know what I had today?  Sugar.  It was gooder than a, <br/>
a...tooter (mostly rhyming with sugar)<br/>
<br/>
dd: Of course it was, a tutor is another word for teacher.  Sugar is <br/>
definitely better than a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
ds: I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t have tutor, aren&#39;t you, Rho?<br/>
<br/>
Hee, hee.  It just keeps getting better around here.  Thank you to all the <br/>
folks on this and the many other unschooling lists I&#39;m on who give me <br/>
something to think about everytime I log on, and the patience to see that it <br/>
is better...yeah, I said BETTER.  I can&#39;t wait to meet everyone in ABQ, just <br/>
booked the room today, we&#39;re soooooooooooooooooo excited.<br/>
