<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726170802">I wanted to tell everyone about our video games. We rented Mario  <br/>
party a  month ago or so, and the kids and I had such a good time  <br/>
with it. We decided we wanted to buy it, at which point Josh  <br/>
explained that there were seven versions! I was shocked, but we  <br/>
talked about it for a while, and he called around to all the used  <br/>
game stores to see which versions they had, and how much they were.  <br/>
We went to Toys R Us (just he and I) and played all the different  <br/>
versions, and then agreed which one we liked best. In the end, when  <br/>
he was camping this weekend with the scouts, i went to Game Stop and  <br/>
bought his favorite version, along with a membership card. He was so  <br/>
thrilled to come home and find that on his desk. I felt like I did  <br/>
something right!<br/>
We played it Sunday afternoon, most of Monday and a great deal of  <br/>
yesterday.<br/>
We also went and bought Narnia yesterday, so we&#39;re waiting til  <br/>
everyone is awake today, and going to pop a big bowl of popcorn and  <br/>
watch it as many times as we want ;-)  It&#39;s making the chickenpox go  <br/>
by much more quickly! Whew!<br/>

Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts 2.  If you like Disney movies you will<br/>
like KH!<br/>
