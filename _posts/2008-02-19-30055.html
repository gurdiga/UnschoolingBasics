has been learned outside of school or school work, and that I knew<br/>
they could learn what and when they wanted or needed to.  They acted<br/>
like it was Christmas.  Well, the 8 y.o. did.  The 12 y.o. was like,<br/>

Right. Plus, you&#39;ve already proved to them that it might be temporary <br/>
again, so it may take a while for them to believe you. Just be patient. <br/>
They can&#39;t help but learn, right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Unschooling *does* take a lot of time---especially in the beginning. <br/>
But as they get older, they start taking up the reins themselves---to <br/>
the point you can&#39;t keep up.<br/>
<br/>
What were your issues last time? What made you start <br/>
&quot;schooling-at-home&quot; again?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I remember you.  And I&#39;m in the same boat.  I have just <br/>
rejoined this group along with some others as my family has moved <br/>
back into unschooling.  In the fall of 2006, my youngest daughter <br/>
decided to go to elementary school.  When she didn&#39;t come home after <br/>
a couple of months, I started doing schooly stuff with my son who <br/>
was still a homeschooler.  It was easy to get caught up in my old <br/>
schooled thinkings.  My daughter lasted all of 3rd grade and about <br/>
one month into 4th grade when she decided she no longer wanted to be <br/>
in school.  Since then, we&#39;ve been been moving from relaxed <br/>
homeschooling back into unschooling.  Last week I made the decision <br/>
to unschool completely, giving total power back to the kids.  They <br/>
are happy to be unschoolers again but have told me they are sure <br/>
we&#39;ll migrate back to schooly stuff at some point.  I didn&#39;t deny I <br/>
might start thinking like that, but asked them to help me find my <br/>
way and for us to just take life one day at a time.  <br/>
<br/>
Even though going to school was my daughter&#39;s idea and she has been <br/>
parented rather differently from many of her peers, school still <br/>
changed her.  Since coming home, my dd9 has really been doing her <br/>
own thing.  We finally did get her some curriculum and I left it up <br/>
to her to do as much or as little as she wanted.  I considered it <br/>
deschooling time especially because she&#39;d still be with us as her <br/>
brother and I were doing things together. (Guess I was thinking <br/>
learning through osmosis.) But still, when I talked to the kids <br/>
about returning to unschooling she was kind of freaked out at <br/>
first.  She asked how she would get educated if we didn&#39;t follow a <br/>
schooly program.  I was quite surprised by her question but we had a <br/>
really good talk.  <br/>
<br/>
So here I am, immersing myself back into a community of people that <br/>
make alot of sense to me.  Just reading through posts is quite <br/>
helpful.  :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nervous is okay. We all have those moments. I try to not act on them <br/>
and they usually pass. I come here, or I read some things I have <br/>
saved and it usually conforms what I know to be true. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;That has always been my rationale for not unschooling - <br/>
 </span></blockquote>unschooling takes too much time.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it takes time. But the time is time well spent...it&#39;s time <br/>
enjoyed, not time spent being frustrated with school work or trying <br/>
to force a child to do something. <br/>
<br/>
Get involved! Do fun stuff! Be fun! Ask your kids for ideas! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad your back!!<br/>

&gt; Unschooling *does* take a lot of time---especially in the beginning. <br/>
&gt; But as they get older, they start taking up the reins themselves---to <br/>
&gt; the point you can&#39;t keep up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What were your issues last time? What made you start <br/>
&gt; &quot;schooling-at-home&quot; again?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well... there were many reasons really.  My kids were enrolled in an<br/>
online homeschooling program which I worked for at the time, and I<br/>
(and they) felt loyal to it and didn&#39;t want to unenroll which would<br/>
mean a lot of creative finagling if they were unschooling.  My kids<br/>
have always loved learning, and haven&#39;t become angry and jaded to it<br/>
like many kids who begin unschooling.  I figured we must be doing just<br/>
fine since they still spent most of the day learning other stuff, and<br/>
were not turned off to schoolish stuff, and overall my relationship<br/>
with them was great.  The job I was in was exhausting.  I would get<br/>
wrapped up in it and my own stuff and not spend time doing things with<br/>
the kids.<br/>
<br/>
What didn&#39;t work about homeschooling, though, is what has brought me<br/>
back.  And it has more to do with relationship and parenting stuff<br/>
than education stuff.  I have always believed in parenting as<br/>
non-coercively as possible.  I respect my kids immensely, and treat<br/>
them as autonomous intelligent people.  We&#39;ve never limited games, tv,<br/>
etc. and never had set bedtimes.  The things we do enforce, though,<br/>
are the things that are bothering me.  Chores... this is my husband&#39;s<br/>
big thing, which I can&#39;t really control anyway.  The chores they do<br/>
are tied to their allowance.  They actually are fine with it usually,<br/>
but my husband is extremely demanding about it (i.e., do it right this<br/>
second).<br/>
<br/>
My 12 y.o. is very stingy with his younger brother (8).  8 y.o. will<br/>
share and do anything for 12 y.o., but it is not reciprocated at all.<br/>
 This really bothers me.  I make him share sometimes, and I&#39;m sure<br/>
that has contributed.  I remember my 17 y.o. being similar with the 12<br/>
y.o. when they were younger, but he outgrew it.  Still, it really gets<br/>
under my skin and I don&#39;t know if I should stay out of it or what.  An<br/>
example would be, they both play Teen Second Life.  12 y.o. will get<br/>
some cool item which he could copy and give a copy to 8 y.o. with no<br/>
loss for himself but refuses to do it when asked.<br/>
<br/>
My 12 y.o. was doing algebra, and would constantly go around saying,<br/>
&quot;I hate math&quot;, which bothers me.  Especially since he&#39;s really good at<br/>
it.  What&#39;s the point of making a 12 y.o. learn Algebra just because<br/>
he&#39;s ready for it... if he wants to learn it in college he has plenty<br/>
of time for that.<br/>
<br/>
The time factor... it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to spend the time. It&#39;s<br/>
that I don&#39;t necessarily trust myself to do it.  For homeschooling, I<br/>
spent a few hours on the weekend planning and maybe a couple hours a<br/>
day actively working with the kids.  A lot of the planning was done<br/>
for me by the program we were using, and some of the work they could<br/>
do independently (especially the 12 y.o.).  That was about all the<br/>
on-time I had with the kids during the week, except for the occasional<br/>
WOW session, book reading, tv show or outing.  I get bored/distracted<br/>
easily, there are few video games I enjoy, and when I&#39;m reading<br/>
something (online or off) I am good at ignoring everything around me.<br/>
  It is hard for me to remain focused with them unless we are doing<br/>
something I enjoy.  But I think I was using the school time as<br/>
rationale for not spending other on-time with them.  At least I would<br/>
get in that requirement each day and that would count for something.<br/>
Not to mention the taekwondo, gymnastics, scouts (cub and boy),<br/>
volunteering at the humane society...  I don&#39;t want school work to be<br/>
my only on-time with my kids.  But I don&#39;t want the lack of schoolwork<br/>
to allow me to not have that time.<br/>
<br/>
So, there&#39;s my weaknesses, and failings, and fears.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Of course it&#39;s ABSOLUTELY possible for you!  You are limited only by <br/>
your thoughts and beliefs!  Belief in schoolish ways is not written <br/>
into your DNA.  It&#39;s a belief, and you get to choose every single <br/>
thought and belief you have.  While most of our thoughts and beliefs <br/>
got into our heads by default, you still get to evaluate them for <br/>
their accuracy, and you get to reject thoughts and beliefs you find <br/>
to be inaccurate or not fitting with your view of life.<br/>
<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
You have all the power about what goes on in your head.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to surround yourself with people (either <br/>
in real life or virtually) who are doing what you want to be doing <br/>
and will support you in making your transition.<br/>
