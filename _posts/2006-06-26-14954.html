<div id="ygrps-yiv-437585559">I am sincerely grateful for all the responses I got about my son, <br/>
his diet (defined: his regular choice of food and drinks) and his <br/>
issues (specifically the ones that are causing him to not feel super <br/>
great).  I have received some great advice that helped my family <br/>
discuss the issues and brainstorm compromises and solutions.  <br/>
<br/>
A funny side issue is that our refrigerator broke this morning.  We <br/>
decided to buy a new one and we got one to fit the changes we hope <br/>
to make.  The refrigerator part is wider than our old side-by-side, <br/>
so the kids are already figuring out how to fit water bottles, juice <br/>
boxes and small individual sized containers with fruits, veggies, <br/>
deli meats and cheese.  We have plans to go grocery shopping after <br/>
our refrigerator is delivered tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
I also appreciate the notes about Kaiser and possibly going outside <br/>
the system.  We all agree that the last doctor I had was not the <br/>
greatest, yet I share some of the blame too for not recognizing the <br/>
need to get a new doctor.  We are interested in hearing what the new <br/>
doctor has to say.  He has already done more for us in one visit <br/>
than my other doctor did in years.  We have a follow-up appt. in a <br/>
couple of weeks to discuss the things we&#39;ve done to date.  If I <br/>
don&#39;t feel like things are improving for my son, I will get him <br/>
evaluated outside the Kaiser system.  <br/>
