<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896753740">In answer to Jill&#39;s question about Model United Nations: They happen <br/>
all over the country, usually organized by the political science <br/>
departments of various colleges. They have them at both the Middle <br/>
School and High School levels -- teams (which might represent several <br/>
countries) are usually formed at schools, but we have a homeschooling <br/>
group preparing for and participating in them. This year we&#39;re doing 2 <br/>
different MUN&#39;s in a year. I think it basically took one homeschooling <br/>
mom&#39;s total diligence and devotion to make it happen here. She first <br/>
taught an Introduction to the UN course, and followed with a course to <br/>
prepare kids for the actual MUN. Now she repeats the process every year <br/>
and we&#39;re all eternally grateful to her! She also dovetailed in a trip <br/>
to NYC to the United Nations, including 2 days of meetings with <br/>
officials and NGO&#39;s (Non-governmental organizations recognized by the <br/>
UN).<br/>

If you get more specifically interested, I can pass along your e-mail <br/>
to her so you can connect for info/advise...<br/>
