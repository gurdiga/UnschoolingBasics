<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130771941">First, let me say &quot;hi&quot;.  It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve posted.  To recap: I&#39;m Maisha, mom to 5, and unschooling 4 of them.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ve been engaged in a bit of debate with some ladies in an email loop that I am a part of.  They don&#39;t understand unschooling at all.  Now I&#39;m confident that unschooling is the way to go and have no plans to change my path.  But I must admit I felt that old familiar question mark popping up in my brain.  And then I went to the library and checked out two books: Comprehensive Curriculum for 2nd grade and the one for 3rd grade.  I flipped through them and thought &quot;I don&#39;t think my kids know any of this stuff!  Are they behind???&quot;  And then came the self doubt and the what ifs.  Add to that I&#39;m working 2-3 days a week.  I can bring the kids with me, but then I worry because they are doing &quot;nothing&quot; but playing while I&#39;m here, and watching PBS at home.  Oh, my kids are 1, 3, 7, 8, and my 17 yr old is a senior in high school.<br/>
   <br/>
  Please help keep me sane.  Tell me my kids are fine and that they truly are learning.  That I don&#39;t need testing and benchmarks, and that they&#39;ll be prepared for life.  I just need that reassurance right now.  Thanks.<br/>

Your kids are fine.  They ARE truly learning.  You don&#39;t need <br/>
testing and benchmarks.  They will be prepared for life.<br/>
<br/>
That aside, kids are born equipped for living and learning.  Live <br/>
and learn with them.  Follow their lead.  Quit listening to those <br/>
around you that insist on telling you the what&#39;s and why&#39;s of what <br/>
they think you are doing wrong.  They have no idea what they are <br/>
talking about.  Despite their so-called education, they are <br/>
uneducated on anything to do with the philosophy of unschooling and <br/>
the blessing found in truly living.<br/>
<br/>
Return the books to the library.  Never check them out again.  <br/>
Everyone is different, so they make no real sense.  Bookmark the <br/>
blogs of experienced unschoolers.  Read &quot;The Teenage Liberation <br/>
Handbook&quot;.  Yes, I know your children are young, but this is SO <br/>
appropriate.  It will build your confidence and broaden your <br/>
horizons.  Not to mention provide you with numerous cool resources.  <br/>
Be sure to get the updated version.  It is the one with the colorful <br/>
cover.  Check out &quot;The unschooling handbook : how to use the whole <br/>
world as your child&#39;s classroom&quot; by Mary Griffith.  This is perfect <br/>
for your age group and provides many ideas to get you started.  Read <br/>
here as often as you can.<br/>
<br/>
Above all, TRUST YOUR CHILDREN.  They are doing what they need to do <br/>
right now.  It&#39;s okay.  One cannot possibly live without learning.  <br/>
Try to deschool yourself.  Once you see living as learning you will <br/>
quit trying to compartmentalise your activities and learn to see the <br/>
value in everything.  You will quit comparing learning levels and <br/>
learn that everyone learns what they need to when they need it.  You <br/>
will quit seeing testing as an accurate measure of knowledge (it SO <br/>
isn&#39;t).  You will quit worrying about everything and find new <br/>
adventures around every corner.  You will start enjoying life.  You <br/>
will recapture your passions and find new ones.  You will make <br/>
friends that encourage you and build you up.  You will live and <br/>
learn WITH your children.  Being fully involved and active in each <br/>
other&#39;s passions is the ultimate in living and SO worth pursuing.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, focus on yourself and have fun...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947711222">Hi Maisha...it&#39;s good to see you here again. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Sounds to me like you&#39;re in a bit of a rut. I remember from the last <br/>
time you posted that finances were tight, but I think you need some <br/>
fun, new things in your lives. There&#39;s plenty you can do with not a <br/>
lot of money. <br/>
<br/>
As far as the other group, you said it yourself...&quot;they don&#39;t <br/>
understand unschooling&quot;. That&#39;s okay if they don&#39;t...you don&#39;t have <br/>
to be the one to explain it to them. You could have spent that time <br/>
flying a kite with your kids. :-)   <br/>
<br/>
As far as asking if they&#39;re behind...are they behind what? who? and <br/>
who decided what &quot;behind&quot; is? School? You&#39;re kids aren&#39;t part of <br/>
that life anymore. :-) Good for them! :-)<br/>
<br/>
What can they do while you work? Can they help you in some way? Do <br/>
they bring books, games? <br/>
And while my kids enjoy PBS also, they wouldn&#39;t want to watch it all <br/>
day. There&#39;s to much other stuff to do. What else do they have going <br/>
on in their lives? <br/>
<br/>
Also...you said this:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m confident that unschooling is the way to go&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then you said this:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Tell me my kids are fine and that they truly are learning.  That <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t need testing and benchmarks, and that they&#39;ll be prepared <br/>
for life.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why are you &quot;confident that unschooling is the way to go&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
Write a list and then read it. Then you won&#39;t need us to tell <br/>
you...you can tell yourself. :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712359628">Maisha,<br/>
<br/>
When I get those anxious feelings (which isn&#39;t so often anymore since I stay<br/>
active on the unschooling lists I&#39;m on) I look at Ren, Kelly, and Sandra (to<br/>
name a few)... I look at their blogs, at their lives, at their posts.  They<br/>
all have teens and young adults who have active,  joyful, productive lives. <br/>
I look and read and then trust... myself and my DD and my God.  I know that<br/>
this path is the right path for us (myself, DD, & DH).  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t discuss my life much with those who wouldn&#39;t understand.  I don&#39;t<br/>
need that kind-of stress.  You should never feel the need to debate the way<br/>
you choose to live your life.  <br/>
<br/>
Quit looking at those books!  At least quit looking at them in the way of<br/>
judging your children and what they know to what&#39;s in that book.  They may<br/>
be a possible source to give you ideas of what you might strew but don&#39;t<br/>
make them what you&#39;re *grading* your children and your lives against.<br/>
<br/>
Hang around unschoolers!  They&#39;re out there... you just might need to look<br/>
underground to find them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-445621521">Here are a few things that really help me when the jitters creep in:  <br/>
   <br/>
  1.  Don&#39;t compare your small people to other small people -- not even to each other.  Each has their own path.  Whenever you compare, you measure.  Someone always looks better and someone always looks worse.  Neither of those labels are useful.  <br/>
   <br/>
  2.  The root of the word education is Latin for &quot;to draw out&quot;.  Mainstream K-12 &quot;education&quot; is a farce.  It&#39;s a creation of a bunch of folks who hold value in knowning this or that.  I was amazing at algebra in high school!!  Never used it since.  Value?  Not for me.  To me, the real value in unschooling is that each of our small people chooses what they need to know.  A true education, as the root of the word suggests.  <br/>
   <br/>
  3.  Unschooling is about life.  Whole life.  My children can change a washer in a faucet.  That&#39;s not taught in school, but does, in fact, have value.  They are able to negotiate through disagreements most of the time.  A lifetime skill that not many have -- even as adults.  They have some knowledge of the limits of their bodies (when do they need to go to sleep, what happens when they get tired, what happens when you eat too many xyz&#39;s, etc.).  I don&#39;t know any schooled child (and many schooled at home as well!!) who have that self-knowledge.  That&#39;s certainly useful, but not found in any curriculum that I know of!!  <br/>
   <br/>
  You&#39;re certainly not silly for feeling this way.  Every so often it happens to me too (and I will then pull out this message and read it to myself!!).  What you&#39;re doing is making a huge difference in their lives as a whole.  What&#39;s algebra in comparison to that??  <br/>
   <br/>

&gt; of this stuff!  Are they behind???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>School is a train going from point A through all the &quot;stuff it&#39;s  <br/>
important to know&quot; to point B. They all have to stay together. They  <br/>
all have to do the stops in the order the train goes through them.  <br/>
Whether they actually understand the stuff is irrelevant. All they  <br/>
need to do is demonstrate they&#39;ve retained it long enough to pass a  <br/>
test. And they they&#39;re free to forget.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids are rambling over the country-side, following one  <br/>
interesting thing to another. (The analogy breaks down there since  <br/>
they can be following and making connections along many paths  <br/>
simultaneously.) They learn because it&#39;s interesting or meaningful to  <br/>
them right now.<br/>
<br/>
All that testing and checking curriculum does is show which of the  <br/>
train stops your kids happened to have explored. What they don&#39;t show  <br/>
is what your kids have explored and learned about *instead*.<br/>
<br/>
School is studying kitchen science. It&#39;s goal is identifying and  <br/>
learning the properties of each ingredient. It&#39;s learning what pots  <br/>
are for. (Again, whether they actually learn for all time isn&#39;t the  <br/>
goal. It&#39;s *hoped* the kids do, but schools can only guarantee that  <br/>
the information went in long enough for the test.) It&#39;s following  <br/>
recipes exactly as they&#39;re printed. It&#39;s pushing information into  <br/>
kids that they (supposedly) could draw on if they ever wanted to cook  <br/>
for real.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is messing around in the kitchen, sometimes following  <br/>
recipes, often making changes and additions and combining recipes,  <br/>
experimenting from scratch. It&#39;s learning how ingredients combine and  <br/>
work together and what equipment can do. It&#39;s real cooking and  <br/>
learning more about it and getting better at it as you go.<br/>
<br/>
School is memorizing vocabulary and grammar of a foreign language you  <br/>
never hear spoken and will never speak.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is immersing in English and picking it up as a side  <br/>
effect because it&#39;s a useful tool for getting what you want.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I flipped through them and thought &quot;I don&#39;t think my kids know any  <br/>
&gt; of this stuff!  Are they behind???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most anyone can memorize stuff for a test. Most anyone can absorb  <br/>
information if they&#39;re sitting trapped in a room with it. Those  <br/>
curriculums aren&#39;t a list of what kids learn; It&#39;s raw information  <br/>
the kids are exposed to. It doesn&#39;t connect to anything. It isn&#39;t  <br/>
meaningful to the kids. It&#39;s just information that the schools get in  <br/>
and hope that it sticks.<br/>
<br/>
But do they truly comprehend what to do with it? Do they understand  <br/>
it? Do they have good feelings associated with it or would they  <br/>
rather they never saw it again outside of a classroom?<br/>
<br/>
Memorizing the times table isn&#39;t understanding what multiplication  <br/>
is. I&#39;d guess that most kids don&#39;t understand multiplication! Most  <br/>
just kick into automatic mode when they see two numbers between a  <br/>
times sign.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids learn things because they&#39;re already using them and  <br/>
they want to know how to do it better.<br/>
<br/>
How many kids hate Shakespeare because of what they experienced in  <br/>
school? They may &quot;know&quot; Shakespeare but what good is any information  <br/>
in their heads about him or his plays when it is so strongly  <br/>
associated with &quot;Yuck!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids get to experience Shakespeare in fun ways: jokes,  <br/>
take offs of bits of his plays, funny images, comedies where the goal  <br/>
of understanding what&#39;s going on is to get the jokes. And then if  <br/>
they want more, they have a bag full of feel-good stuff about him.<br/>
<br/>
The same goes for everything kids &quot;learn&quot; in school. What good is all  <br/>
that information: math and science and writing and English if it&#39;s so  <br/>
dull and irrelevant that kids want to avoid it as much as possible?<br/>
<br/>
Why not just skip the bad taste and learn about the things you&#39;re  <br/>
actually using and enjoying?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-418693541">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just started unschooling this year.  My kids are 11<br/>
and 9.  At first I was nervous that they wouldn&#39;t<br/>
learn what they needed, but after a short time, they<br/>
are learning on their own.  My daughter (9) has had<br/>
alot of problems doing math at school.  Since she has<br/>
been home, she has been doing basic math on her own. <br/>
We play video games together, and she&#39;ll add things<br/>
together, and when I ask her what she did, I tell her<br/>
you just did math.  She smiles, and keeps going.<br/>
<br/>
Life is meant to be lived, and to be free.  There is<br/>
no testing in homeschooling, so relax and breathe. <br/>
Kids will learn things even through playing.  You will<br/>
all be fine.  I know I wasn&#39;t sure at first, but the<br/>
bench marks in those books, are I think for where<br/>
people say your kids should be.  Take them back to the<br/>
library, and forget about them.  Have fun with your<br/>
kids, find things they like to do, and enjoy doing<br/>
them with your kids.  It&#39;s so much better, and a more<br/>
fun approach, than anything I could ever imagine. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.  Just hug each other, and love each<br/>
other, and the learning will come naturally.<br/>

&gt; &gt; First, let me say &quot;hi&quot;. It&#39;s been a while since<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve posted. To  <br/>
&gt; &gt; recap: I&#39;m Maisha, mom to 5, and unschooling 4 of<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been engaged in a bit of debate with some<br/>
&gt; ladies in an email  <br/>
&gt; &gt; loop that I am a part of. They don&#39;t understand<br/>
&gt; unschooling at all.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now I&#39;m confident that unschooling is the way to<br/>
&gt; go and have no  <br/>
&gt; &gt; plans to change my path. But I must admit I felt<br/>
&gt; that old familiar  <br/>
&gt; &gt; question mark popping up in my brain. And then I<br/>
&gt; went to the  <br/>
&gt; &gt; library and checked out two books: Comprehensive<br/>
&gt; Curriculum for 2nd  <br/>
&gt; &gt; grade and the one for 3rd grade. I flipped through<br/>
&gt; them and thought  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#39;t think my kids know any of this stuff! Are<br/>
&gt; they behind???&quot;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; And then came the self doubt and the what ifs. Add<br/>
&gt; to that I&#39;m  <br/>
&gt; &gt; working 2-3 days a week. I can bring the kids with<br/>
&gt; me, but then I  <br/>
&gt; &gt; worry because they are doing &quot;nothing&quot; but playing<br/>
&gt; while I&#39;m here,  <br/>
&gt; &gt; and watching PBS at home. Oh, my kids are 1, 3, 7,<br/>
&gt; 8, and my 17 yr  <br/>
&gt; &gt; old is a senior in high school.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please help keep me sane. Tell me my kids are fine<br/>
&gt; and that they  <br/>
&gt; &gt; truly are learning. That I don&#39;t need testing and<br/>
&gt; benchmarks, and  <br/>
&gt; &gt; that they&#39;ll be prepared for life. I just need<br/>
&gt; that reassurance  <br/>
&gt; &gt; right now. Thanks.<br/>

Yes, and this child has already had math difficulty in school.  I  think a <br/>
little confidence is a great thing right now.<br/>

A good discussion about how math plays a large part of real life and it  <br/>

I believe Einstein said something along the lines of 95% of the physics  <br/>

long, they have alot of self doubt.<br/>

She has had anxiety problems in school with math alot,<br/>

every day things.  I always tell her and her brother<br/>
how proud I am of both of them.  She is doing better<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105344266">Too black and white (LOL wouldn&#39;t my spouse just love to hear me say that!)<br/>
My oldest does formal school and all the other unschooling stuff, too!  For her, she speaks all the languages she studies, excels at them, actually.  She loves learning.  She retains what she learns.  She hates stupid teachers that don&#39;t teach.  She teaches herself many things like glow-sticking, web-design, all about acupuncture (she currently wants to do this professionally and is planning to study it in college).  She researches all types of things just because she is curious.  So for her, formal (private & public) school works.  She wants nothing to do with home(un)schooling.  She has a wide variety of friends, whom all have different interests.  She also was reading at age two.  No one &#39;taught&#39; her.  That&#39;s just the way she is.<br/>
 <br/>
My son?  He also has a very high IQ.  There&#39;s no teaching him as he just gets it.  We unschool.  I tried homeschool but it seemed silly as he already knows the things he would be covering in his age defined class level.  I started out this year opening the Language Arts book to learn that he had already figured out the rules from his extensive reading.  He just hadn&#39;t seen the rules written out.  So I joined this group to get insight.  (Very good advice on these pages!)<br/>
 <br/>
Guess I believe, in the description of unschooling from birth as it fits the way I raised my kids.  I see the benefit of involved parents whether they chose school or unschool.  I was never the drop the kid off parent.  I was the one who pulled my kid out after one day of observing poor teaching and moved twenty miles so my daughter would be in an excellent class with an excellent teacher. (I was divorced and worked full-time and had never heard of homeschooling)<br/>
To me, my job (as teacher) was to nurture the love of learning.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m still laughing that I, who was raised to see everything in black and white have learned to see gray areas.  = )<br/>

&gt; I flipped through them and thought &quot;I don&#39;t think my kids know any <br/>
&gt; of this stuff! Are they behind???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
School is a train going from point A through all the &quot;stuff it&#39;s <br/>
important to know&quot; to point B. They all have to stay together. They <br/>
all have to do the stops in the order the train goes through them. <br/>
Whether they actually understand the stuff is irrelevant. All they <br/>
need to do is demonstrate they&#39;ve retained it long enough to pass a <br/>
test. And they they&#39;re free to forget.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids are rambling over the country-side, following one <br/>
interesting thing to another. (The analogy breaks down there since <br/>
they can be following and making connections along many paths <br/>
simultaneously. ) They learn because it&#39;s interesting or meaningful to <br/>
them right now.<br/>
<br/>
All that testing and checking curriculum does is show which of the <br/>
train stops your kids happened to have explored. What they don&#39;t show <br/>
is what your kids have explored and learned about *instead*.<br/>
<br/>
School is studying kitchen science. It&#39;s goal is identifying and <br/>
learning the properties of each ingredient. It&#39;s learning what pots <br/>
are for. (Again, whether they actually learn for all time isn&#39;t the <br/>
goal. It&#39;s *hoped* the kids do, but schools can only guarantee that <br/>
the information went in long enough for the test.) It&#39;s following <br/>
recipes exactly as they&#39;re printed. It&#39;s pushing information into <br/>
kids that they (supposedly) could draw on if they ever wanted to cook <br/>
for real.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is messing around in the kitchen, sometimes following <br/>
recipes, often making changes and additions and combining recipes, <br/>
experimenting from scratch. It&#39;s learning how ingredients combine and <br/>
work together and what equipment can do. It&#39;s real cooking and <br/>
learning more about it and getting better at it as you go.<br/>
<br/>
School is memorizing vocabulary and grammar of a foreign language you <br/>
never hear spoken and will never speak.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is immersing in English and picking it up as a side <br/>
effect because it&#39;s a useful tool for getting what you want.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I flipped through them and thought &quot;I don&#39;t think my kids know any <br/>
&gt; of this stuff! Are they behind???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Most anyone can memorize stuff for a test. Most anyone can absorb <br/>
information if they&#39;re sitting trapped in a room with it. Those <br/>
curriculums aren&#39;t a list of what kids learn; It&#39;s raw information <br/>
the kids are exposed to. It doesn&#39;t connect to anything. It isn&#39;t <br/>
meaningful to the kids. It&#39;s just information that the schools get in <br/>
and hope that it sticks.<br/>
<br/>
But do they truly comprehend what to do with it? Do they understand <br/>
it? Do they have good feelings associated with it or would they <br/>
rather they never saw it again outside of a classroom?<br/>
<br/>
Memorizing the times table isn&#39;t understanding what multiplication <br/>
is. I&#39;d guess that most kids don&#39;t understand multiplication! Most <br/>
just kick into automatic mode when they see two numbers between a <br/>
times sign.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids learn things because they&#39;re already using them and <br/>
they want to know how to do it better.<br/>
<br/>
How many kids hate Shakespeare because of what they experienced in <br/>
school? They may &quot;know&quot; Shakespeare but what good is any information <br/>
in their heads about him or his plays when it is so strongly <br/>
associated with &quot;Yuck!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids get to experience Shakespeare in fun ways: jokes, <br/>
take offs of bits of his plays, funny images, comedies where the goal <br/>
of understanding what&#39;s going on is to get the jokes. And then if <br/>
they want more, they have a bag full of feel-good stuff about him.<br/>
<br/>
The same goes for everything kids &quot;learn&quot; in school. What good is all <br/>
that information: math and science and writing and English if it&#39;s so <br/>
dull and irrelevant that kids want to avoid it as much as possible?<br/>
<br/>
Why not just skip the bad taste and learn about the things you&#39;re <br/>
actually using and enjoying?<br/>

When unschoolers panic, it isn&#39;t about how their kids are going to  <br/>
learn the things they enjoy doing! ;-) It&#39;s about how they&#39;re going  <br/>
to learn the things they&#39;ve shown no interest in. If it supposedly  <br/>
takes 12 years of a couple hours a day of instruction and practice to  <br/>
learn math for college and a child at home has done no math (that the  <br/>
parent recognizes) that seems like something to worry about!<br/>
<br/>
But fortunately natural learning works a whole lot differently! :-)  <br/>
and rarely looks like school-style learning.<br/>

Well, you actually use it every day. It just doesn&#39;t look like x and y. <br/>
It looks like speeding cars and slippery glasses and cookies baking. <br/>
It&#39;s REAL math. Every day.<br/>
