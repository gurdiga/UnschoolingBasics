<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050389841">Hi,<br/>
   <br/>
  First off, I hope it is ok to post this here. I am sorry if not :(<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m trying to get together a group for the Tarrant County area in TX for fun things like park days.  If you&#39;re in the area and are interested here is the Yahoo!Group  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TCFunschoolers">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TCFunschoolers</a>  It is called Tarrant County Funschoolers. Come by and introduce yourself!<br/>
