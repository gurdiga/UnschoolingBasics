I think it&#39;s wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
And it won&#39;t last but a few years: as soon as they hit puberty, they <br/>
will be looking to have separate rooms with privacy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513442246">Chrissy, I have a son, just turned 13 last week, and a<br/>
10 1/2 yr old daughter who share a room. This isn&#39;t by<br/>
choice, it&#39;s just the way things are. We live in a 650<br/>
square foot, one bedroom house. Dh and I sleep on a<br/>
Murphy bed in the living room and the kids share the<br/>
only bedroom. A couple of years ago we built loft beds<br/>
for them. With them on opposite sides of the room, her<br/>
half flowery and pink, his... well... boy messy with<br/>
buy stuff hanging everywhere. They have their own<br/>
private spaces and they use the floor space between<br/>
them as shared play space. We have a plan for<br/>
separating the room in half with sliders so they can<br/>
have privacy yet open for when they want to play<br/>
together on the open floor. I have been collecting the<br/>
doors from Craigslist but they aren&#39;t interested in<br/>
putting them up. I&#39;m sure there are lots of people out<br/>
there who think their sharing a room is awful and I<br/>
generally do not share that information with people<br/>
for fear of their reaction. I would love for them to<br/>
each have their own room because I always wanted my<br/>
own room when I was a kid, but no one is unhappy with<br/>
the way things are. In actuality, they revel in their<br/>
togetherness. He puts up with her singing half the<br/>
night and she never complains when he has the light on<br/>
to read. And they laugh, be prepared, they laugh<br/>
LOTS!!! It works for us. Personally, I think your kids<br/>
have a great plan and when they are ready for more<br/>
privacy and want their own rooms back they will tell<br/>
you. Just be prepared for their shared room to be<br/>
quite unique by the time they finish decorating,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I second that!  I have a friend that has six children between two <br/>
bedrooms, and both are mixed gender rooms.  The two oldest, boy and <br/>
girl, wanted to share a room simply because they are older.  It keeps <br/>
the little ones out of their personal belongings and they have a <br/>
greater capacity to respect each others need for space.  They&#39;re 12 <br/>
and 10.  The younger ones are one girl, 6, twin boys, 4, and another <br/>
boy,2.  From what I see they are all happy with the arrangement...much <br/>
more so than they were when it was boys and girls in separate rooms.<br/>
<br/>
As Kelly mentioned it will only be for a time anyway.  Once they get <br/>
older they will surely want their own space.  It can be good is SO <br/>
many ways.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466214582">My son 11 and daughter 8 have had &#39;sleepovers&#39; for years.  I used to<br/>
have issues with  it, thanks to society but eventually those issues<br/>
subsided.  Sometimes they&#39;ll share the bed and sleep toe-to-head but 9<br/>
of 10 times, ds brings his bedding into dd&#39;s room and crashes on the<br/>
floor.  It still cracks us up to hear them  ask, &quot;Hey, Zak?  Want to<br/>
have a sleepover?&quot;  &quot;Sure.  My room or yours?&quot;  &quot;How about my room,<br/>
I&#39;m not comfortable on the floor.&quot;  DD LOVES her own bed and DS LOVES<br/>
&#39;camping out&#39;.  It&#39;s especially funny when they have sleepovers after<br/>
an ugly fight.  Too precious, I know it won&#39;t last for ever but I&#39;ll<br/>
cherish it in the meantime.<br/>

For me i could never do difderent sexs in the same  room.  We rent and in IL <br/>
it is illegal to have 2 kids of opposite sex  in the same room if one is over <br/>
the age of 6.  And they wont rent to you  you if you dont have a room for <br/>
each. I dont have a girls but one of my very  good friends does and she is getting <br/>
evicted because of this exact  law.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-395521760">***Bethy  age 8 and half  and Jacob 7 want to share a room and turn the <br/>

<br/>
There were five of us in one room when I was growing up. &lt;g&gt;  One bunk<br/>
bed for the two littlest (myself and my brother Joe)  one double bed for<br/>
the two big boys, Ron and David, one single bed for my sister, Sue (aka<br/>
Ruth, Carol, and Booger Head)<br/>
<br/>
After the big boys went to collage I got to share the big bed with Sue<br/>
and Joe got the single bed.  Poor Sue got peed on a lot.   She never had<br/>
children and sometimes I wonder if that&#39;s why. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know for a long time that some kids had their own room.  We<br/>
didn&#39;t choose to share a room... I would have chosen to have my own room<br/>
if there was room. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s lovely that your kids like each other well enough to want to<br/>
share a room.   And when they don&#39;t like that arrangement anymore they&#39;ll<br/>
know you will help them make a different one.  Very nice. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When Keon was 5 and Mary Elayne was 8 they shared a room.  It worked well.<br/>
However when we started house hunting they definitely wanted their own<br/>
spaces.  If they want to share a room be open to the idea.  Let them try it<br/>
and if it doesn&#39;t work then know that it isn&#39;t a permanent move and that<br/>
they can reclaim their own spaces again later.  We&#39;ve done lots of room<br/>
shuffling because of desires of different members of the family desiring<br/>
different things for various reasons.<br/>

Yeah i had a women in my apt building about 4 years ago that  actually got <br/>
CPS called on her for who knows what, but they came in saw her boy  and girl <br/>
ages 14 and 9 where in the same room and gave her 7 days to get them in  separate <br/>
bedrooms or have them potenially taken away.  It was a huge  mess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429482771">Okay, I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;ve done a crapload of searches this morning<br/>
(including those concerning states below) and could find not one<br/>
single law that outlaws opposite sex siblings sharing a room.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it may be illegal for non-siblings but not for blood siblings.<br/>
  I&#39;ll stand corrected if need be but until there can be an actual law<br/>
with reference number shown, I&#39;d say it is probably a misunderstanding.<br/>

I&#39;m not trying to be harsh or critical, just trying to find out the fact.<br/>

 <br/>
Okay, I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;ve done a crapload of searches this morning<br/>
(including those concerning states below) and could find not one<br/>
single law that outlaws opposite sex siblings sharing a room.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it may be illegal for non-siblings but not for blood siblings.<br/>
  I&#39;ll stand corrected if need be but until there can be an actual law<br/>
with reference number shown, I&#39;d say it is probably a misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be harsh or critical, just trying to find out the fact.<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
Sandy Winn<br/>

  <br/>
Wow!  That&#39;s a pretty stringent law to have.  It makes it awfully tough on parents who have multiple children of opposite sexes.  That&#39;s pretty sad.<br/>

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present.&quot; <br/>

That&#39;s what I was saying when I said I knew you could get evicted if  you had <br/>
a child of another sex when you only had 2  bedrooms.  I&#39;m not  sure what the <br/>
laws are, but I have a feeling there are a lot of   ordinances.<br/>
