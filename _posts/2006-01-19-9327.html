<div id="ygrps-yiv-398525446">&quot;Thanks - I won&#39;t post anymore about this topic,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think you should!! This topic rolls around every so often, we bust a<br/>
few myths and VOILA! another family starts to see the &quot;effects&quot; of tv,<br/>
were really more about control than the television itself.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good fodder for discussion. It sharpens our thinking skills,<br/>
helps us debate whether or not the common assumptions about television<br/>
are correct and  helps more people than just the ones in the discussion. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t feel badly for bringing up a very interesting and highly<br/>
discussed topic.  I used to feel just like you and now tv has no power<br/>
in our lives, it&#39;s just another tool for learning...like everything in<br/>
the world.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a tough shift to make, but when a parent gives a television power<br/>
(by thinking it&#39;s &quot;addicting&quot; or youth can&#39;t use critical thinking<br/>
skills to see past advertising) then it does have power.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, my children have asked for things on television, but that<br/>
doesn&#39;t make the thing bad, just because the company advertised does it?<br/>
We have lots of good conversation about manipulation in advertising<br/>
and how to research consumer reports and such.  My dd still wants to<br/>
buy the Floam after reading the reviews here (and knowing it won&#39;t act<br/>
like the ads make it sound, and that it might stink etc..) and it will<br/>
be a wonderful learning experience for her.<br/>
<br/>
Making poor choices, leads to better choices. So it&#39;s ok if they want<br/>
things that don&#39;t meet their expectations. It&#39;s ok for us, it&#39;s ok for<br/>
them. More often than not, it leads to a bunch of research on the<br/>
internet to see if the ad is midleading or if there&#39;s a similar<br/>
product that&#39;s better!<br/>
<br/>
Back when novels first came out, people were very negative about the<br/>
&quot;effects&quot; of reading such trash. Every new form of communication seems<br/>
to scare the older generation. Eventually it becomes accepted, then<br/>
maybe even revered (look how we worship reading books and villify<br/>
tv)...so it&#39;s all part of history. We&#39;re on the curve of teleision<br/>
being relatively new in history, and people are just beginning to show<br/>
studies that are positive. We&#39;ll get there.:)<br/>
