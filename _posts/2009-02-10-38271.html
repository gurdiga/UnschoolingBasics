<div id="ygrps-yiv-793041306">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Lori and I am a homeschooling Mom of two years to Christopher<br/>
10, Lily 8, Emma 5, and Matthew 2. I live in Connecticut and my husband<br/>
and I work opposite each other so we can be home with our children. I<br/>
work two 10 hour shifts each week and he is self employed and works on<br/>
the days I am off. When he does not have work I will pick up extra at<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
We currently do an eclectic type of cirruculum with the kids. Math from<br/>
here, language from there..etc. I think they are learning from some of<br/>
what they are doing but not from everything they are doing. I guess I<br/>
feel some of what they are doing is a waste of time for them because<br/>
they are not learning from it.<br/>
<br/>
In my core I believe unschooling is the best way to learn. I am just<br/>
afraid of the following and hoped some of the seasoned unschoolers out<br/>
there could give me some advice that would maybe ease my mind so we<br/>
could try unschooling. Ok here is my not all inclusive list of fears...<br/>
<br/>
1. With four kids and working opposite each other, and money issues my<br/>
husband and I are a bit stressed to say the least. I am worried that<br/>
either of us will not have the time to foster what each of their<br/>
interests are as there are four of them and only one of us at a time and<br/>
we have no family support. When we are home there is so much to be done<br/>
that I feel to unschool effectively you need to have alot of extra time<br/>
to devote to your kids passions. Please don&#39;t get me wrong it is not<br/>
that we don&#39;t want to have the extra time the reality is that very often<br/>
there is just many other things to do ie, cooking, cleaning, laundry,<br/>
shopping, paying bills, bookwork for the business etc.<br/>
<br/>
2. We have no extra money to buy resources for them to persue their<br/>
passions. There are many things they would like to do (places to go) or<br/>
buy and we just don&#39;t have the finances to do this for them. I just feel<br/>
like if we can&#39;t provide these things for them they will not be able to<br/>
learn the things they could if we were able to provide more for them.<br/>
<br/>
3. What if they don&#39;t learn...there is no turning back...I can&#39;t get<br/>
those years back for them...what if they are disadvantaged for life. I<br/>
believe if they had the resources (see #2) they could learn but without<br/>
them I am not sure.<br/>
<br/>
4. Can the state penilize you for unschooling. We live in Connecticut<br/>
for now...(thinking about relocating to Florida)...CT is very easy on<br/>
homeschooling but I still worry if it gets out that we unschool that we<br/>
could get in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
So that is bascially it...time, money, big brother and once commited not<br/>
getting the years back if it doesn&#39;t work...those are my main<br/>
fears...Side note...I have anxiety issues so if these seem unrealistic<br/>
they may be..I tend to worry about EVERYTHING!!!<br/>
<br/>
So I would love any personal stories, words of encouragement, helpful<br/>
hints or anything that may help me so I could do what I really want to<br/>
do in my heart. Unschooling makes sense to me, it feels right...I just<br/>
have to get past these fears and have some peace and then I think we<br/>
would be okay.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to babble... [:)]<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 <br/>
Hi, Lori,<br/>
 Well, I&#39;ll reply to #3:  That&#39;s exactly the point, there is no second<br/>
chance at childhood!!  The idea is that children will learn what they<br/>
need to learn WHEN they need to learn it and THEY know what they need.<br/>
It makes absolutely no sense to them (or to me!!) when they are<br/>
presented with arbitrary school work and subjects that have little to<br/>
nothing to do with daily life for them.  Children (humans) are natural<br/>
explorers and want to fit in with the world around them.  So, every<br/>
exploration should be valued!  Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s just &quot;fluff&quot; on TV<br/>
or looking through a microscope!  THEY are getting something out of what<br/>
they are doing.   How would you feel if your husband said to you &quot;You<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be wasting your time reading that book!  You should be<br/>
learning calculus instead.  I want you to learn calculus and do these<br/>
problems by the end of the week.&quot;  If you decide to pursue a degree in<br/>
engineering, calculus will certainly be valuable and you&#39;ll want to<br/>
learn it.  If not, it&#39;s a chore and doesn&#39;t fit into your life!<br/>
 I think where you&#39;re driving yourself nuts is that you expect their<br/>
explorations to look like school work. ( I&#39;ve been there!)  Some days it<br/>
may resemble that, some days not, esp. the younger they are.  Children<br/>
play and that is what childhood should be about.  Feel free to strew the<br/>
house with new things-a colorful rock on the kitchen table in the<br/>
morning, books from the library brought in the car for a trip to the<br/>
store, go on Netflix and pick out DVDs and pop them in and watch them,<br/>
etc.  Pursue your own interests, as well!  Show them that adults don&#39;t<br/>
just do work around the house (though I do enjoy a bit of housework :-))<br/>
but like to paint, read, take hikes, whatever. And join in on their fun,<br/>
too.<br/>
I guarantee that anything they are doing is not a waste of their time or<br/>
yours!  As they grow older, you&#39;ll find some of their interests may<br/>
become more academically-oriented, as they grow out of playing with<br/>
Legos, dressing up, etc. and look to maybe going to college.   Hey, my<br/>
41 y.o. friend still likes to hula hoop!!   For now, let childhood be<br/>
happy and enjoyable, not a time for acculumating info from school<br/>
subjects. :-)<br/>

<br/>
1. With four kids and working opposite each other, and money issues my<br/>

there is just many other things to do ie, cooking, cleaning, laundry,<br/>
shopping, paying bills, bookwork for the business etc.<br/>
<br/>
***Time is a hot commodity for most people :-) You make time for your<br/>
priorities. Once you kick the books you will have all that time you use to<br/>
devote to book study to follow your family&#39;s bliss. I am sure that you will<br/>
eventually work it out. It might be hard at first, you may feel pressed to<br/>
*DO* a lot. Take it easy, relax, allow yourself and your kids to de-school a<br/>
bit. You will find your groove. I am a list maker so I have lists, lol. I<br/>
have my daily chore list (for me not my kids) of the household stuff I would<br/>
like to tackle to maintain the house adequately. My standards may not be<br/>
your standards. My standards aren&#39;t much as I would rather play with the<br/>
kids or go somewhere than scrub a bunch so I really just maintain and then<br/>
every once in a while do a good clean. I blogged about how I clean online<br/>
(see bottom of email for link). Having a monthly calendar helps us too. We<br/>
fill out our calendar so we don&#39;t over book. We have a few things we<br/>
&quot;always&quot; do and then work around them to fill in the rest. We sometimes<br/>
schedule in time to relax. We also have a date night for individuals (ie<br/>
Mama and dd12 or papa and ds6, etc) that happen weekly for some on on one<br/>
time. It isn&#39;t a lot but it works for us.<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
2. We have no extra money to buy resources for them to persue their<br/>
passions. There are many things they would like to do (places to go) or<br/>
buy and we just don&#39;t have the finances to do this for them. I just feel<br/>
like if we can&#39;t provide these things for them they will not be able to<br/>
learn the things they could if we were able to provide more for them.<br/>
<br/>
***Well is that absolutely true? You have no money at all for passions? If<br/>
it is than maybe it won&#39;t work right now. But I think you might be surprised<br/>
if you dig a little deeper. First off learning is free. It doesn&#39;y have to<br/>
cost a lot. You likely already buy your kids toys/games/books. You bought<br/>
your ciruicullum books. You maybe be able to wrangle your finances a liitle<br/>
more.<br/>
We cut things that are less important abd put money  towards things that we<br/>
find important. Like we don&#39;t buy clothes, except socks and skivvies. I get<br/>
them free from a clothing free store or craigslist or freecycle.<br/>
Occaisionally we will buy clothes at a yardsale but only if it is special<br/>
like a pokemon shirt or happy bunny shirts. Specific or nice clothes isn&#39;y<br/>
important. However, going to unschooling gatherings are major priority. We<br/>
just spent about 500 bucks on a week at the water park. It was worth every<br/>
penny and we surely woulkd have been happier with nicer clothes.<br/>
We also don&#39;t spend a lot on books. We use to not spend any but now my dd12<br/>
needs certain books when they first come out :-) It feeds her passion.Other<br/>
boos we get off craigslist, freecycle, the free book thing (in Baltimore<br/>
MD), paperbackswap.com, ebay, half.com or the library.<br/>
Toys are free or cheap too. Added to the other places we score at thrift<br/>
stores or yard sales as well. My kids ask for something I try to find it,<br/>
free or cheap. If I can&#39;t it goes on our vision board and we get it when we<br/>
can afford it. Feed the passions.<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t doing any formal classes right now. We have and they can be<br/>
the right fit for a passion but not the only way to feed their souls. There<br/>
are a few animal care classes my dd could take but she volunteers at a cat<br/>
rescue and gets double the benefits for free. My kids do youth combat<br/>
through SCA and that is free and their favorite activity! We get out a lot<br/>
to parks (free) and take use of free museum days or we buy passes and see a<br/>
museum a lot for a while and move on. Since we travel our museum passes<br/>
really are worth it. We have a science center pass that allows us to enter<br/>
for one year 5 museums within a 1.5 hour drive plus countless others around<br/>
the country. For less than 100 bucks a year!<br/>
We do a working share with CSA and get food (veggies) in exchange for our<br/>
service. It is fun and good exercise (no gym needed). We also get loads of<br/>
nutrious food. There are also discount food shopping places. I shop around<br/>
to food shopping. I make sure I am getting the best prices on what we eat. I<br/>
spend about 150 on a family of 5 (3 adults sized eaters and 2 kids) per<br/>
week. I am looking to go lower when we start the CSA for the summer. I<br/>
noticed a huge savings when we stopped eating as entertainment. we still<br/>
entertain ourselves with special meals but we spend more energy making them<br/>
from scratch and really enjoying them. We rarely do prepackaged anymore. we<br/>
also don&#39;t eat out. We realized that with a toddler and a high sensative<br/>
child it just wasn&#39;t fun. Perhaps in a few years :-) My oldest loves to<br/>
experienment with different cultural foods so we make sure she hows an<br/>
outlet (my mother and her go out once a month or so).<br/>
Today my kids are biking (it is sooooo warm) and down at our local<br/>
playground. I am not there because the baby is asleep in my arms. But those<br/>
things are free. We have a bunch of cool stuff at our house as well, a<br/>
trampoline, a wii, a club house, a play room, an art/projects room. There is<br/>
a lot of to do just hanging around our house. We have a buhnch of cool books<br/>
with ideas in them to browse in case they run out...I don&#39;t think they have<br/>
cracked them much as they have thier own ideas. Much of what we have at our<br/>
house was free or hella cheap. I get all of ourstuff (furniture, clothes,<br/>
etc) from freecycle, friends, craigslist, &quot;sidewalk&quot; scores, etc. I have a<br/>
mental list and a physical list (personal vision boards) of all the stuff my<br/>
people like.<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
3. What if they don&#39;t learn...there is no turning back...I can&#39;t get<br/>
those years back for them...what if they are disadvantaged for life. I<br/>
believe if they had the resources (see #2) they could learn but without<br/>
them I am not sure.<br/>
<br/>
***Exactly, each second is precious. Don&#39;t waste it doing things that don&#39;t<br/>
feed you soul, your passions, create joy not resentment. if it doens&#39;t work<br/>
out (I can&#39;t even imagine how/why) Catching up with school aged peers is<br/>
really easy. Kids learn what they need to know. It is not what you know but<br/>
that you have the desire to learn that is really important.<br/>
<br/>
I think you are imagining that they will unschool themselves and still keep<br/>
the world divided into school subjects. They won&#39;t and that ok, no it is<br/>
beet than ok it is good. The world outside of school isn&#39;t broken into<br/>
subjects. We don&#39;t all know the same things abotu the same things. That is<br/>
good. There is no reason for your child/ren to know what other kids her/his<br/>
age know.<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
4. Can the state penilize you for unschooling. We live in Connecticut<br/>
for now...(thinking about relocating to Florida)...CT is very easy on<br/>
homeschooling but I still worry if it gets out that we unschool that we<br/>
could get in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
***I don&#39;t know that CT laws are but unschooling is the same legally as any<br/>
other kind of &quot;homeschooling&quot;. You don&#39;t have to specify that you are<br/>
unschooling as opposed to schooling at home. You just have to figure out how<br/>
to comply withthe laws. It is typically quite easy.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
  Unschooling makes sense to me, it feels right...I just<br/>
have to get past these fears and have some peace and then I think we<br/>
would be okay.<br/>
<br/>
***Let go off you fears. The future will happen whether we worry about it or<br/>
not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Its not so much a matter of &quot;extra&quot; time as making the effort to <br/>
connect with all your kids every day. How you do that is going to be <br/>
really different across ages and personalities, though. Some of it <br/>
will be one-on-one - working on a project together, watching a movie <br/>
together, cooking together... but some of that will also happen in <br/>
the natural course of interacting as a family. When you make an <br/>
effort to stay connected with your kids you&#39;ll find you have a good <br/>
sense of what their interests and passions are - that will let you <br/>
keep an eye open for ideas along the way. I&#39;m not saying its a <br/>
passive process, but it doesn&#39;t have to be some huge &quot;special&quot; effort <br/>
of time and energy, either.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; buy and we just don&#39;t have the finances to do this for them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is something we struggle with, too. It takes some creativity to <br/>
find ways for our kids to persue their interests that we can afford. <br/>
Networking with others is one of our best resources - single adults, <br/>
childless couples, families with kids in school and at home, anyone <br/>
at all can turn out to be a resource. Ask others what they do for <br/>
fun! That can be enough, at times, to open a door or just spark a new <br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
What are some of your kids&#39; interests? Maybe someone right here on <br/>
this board can help you brainstorm!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t learn what? That sounds snarky, but its meant seriously - <br/>
exactly what do they need to learn? How do you know?<br/>
<br/>
There are times when I feel horribly disadvantaged by my education... <br/>
I was such a good student that it was easy for parents and teachers <br/>
alike to ignore my passions and talents in favor of my academic <br/>
skills. Sometimes I feel like I learned all the wrong things! But <br/>
from an academic standpoint, they were all the &quot;right&quot; things for &quot;a <br/>
successful future&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until I was in my twenties that I learned the things I <br/>
*really* needed all along - what and how I learn best, and how to <br/>
communicate effectively. My kids aren&#39;t having to wait that long. By <br/>
persuing their passions, they are learning what and how they learn <br/>
best Right Now. By living in the real world every day they are <br/>
learning important communication skills. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4. Can the state penilize you for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is a kind of homeschooling and therefore legal. Some <br/>
states require more documentation than others to show kids <br/>
are &quot;learning&quot; in ways that the state understands, but its still <br/>
possible to unschool and find ways to appease the state - because <br/>
learning is going on all the time. Check for local unschooling groups <br/>
online - other unschoolers in your state will be the best source of <br/>
specific advice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-727375857">Lori, <br/>
<br/>
I myself am new to homeschooling/unschooling..we follow no curriculum at all and my son is the happiest he has ever been I dare to say! :) We are for sure more $ broke than most as I live on a disability pension from the VA. I could get food stamps but as long as I have my 4 horses I can not justify the govt buying my food! LOL So do not let $ be a deterrent...I signed up with several local Homeschool Yahoo groups and take my son on field trips with them, go to the parties they have (Today was a Valentine Party) and play dates so my son is having fun for very little money and learning. I also get free tutoring at a local State University for my son in Speech and Reading which I count as a school day as in a real school he would not get an hour one on one with an instructor. I have him signed up on a Yahoo Homeschool Penpal group and he has gotten 5 penpals from around the USA..He writes them back and forth and learns to WRITE and geography as he looks up<br/>
 where they live on a map etc. It is all learning, just in simple ways that he enjoys!   Also have him in a youth group AWANAS at a local church where he has to complete a workbook. I can not get him to do work in a workbook for anything! He hates them..but is so happy to do it at church, all learning experiences! <br/>
<br/>
Just enjoy them enjoying life and they will learn as you read on here. My son&#39;s passion is to do manly things..he is 8..He has been helping my neighor a carpenter put up fencing here and building things..he loves that and can measure and do math that has to do with roofing, all due to him going to work with my neighbor! He is learning, all be it not what a typical schooled  8 yr old learns, but what interests him.<br/>
<br/>
 Really check out FL before you move there. They pay way less than most states and it is getting bad for gangs etc..I am from Orlando..my older son goes to college there and my parents and siblings live in Central FL. (Oveido, Winter Haven, Winter Park) It is getting rough there with a murder every day or so in Orlando! It is very much turning into New York... Just do your research and line up a job first as the pay is WAY low compared to the North. Just a heads up..My older son went to Winter Park High school in Winter Park FL and told me of the horrors of the gangs even in that school which was SUPPOSED to be one of the better ones...Winter Park is a NICE area...so just do your research before you move.<br/>
<br/>
Do not let $ stress you out...You can survive on alot less than you know! I am living proof.. I used to have the #1 Middle Eastern Restaurant in Central FL and lived very well..now I feel I live very well but am seriously poor on the $ scales you read about! I have my horses etc and we do just fine, lean living is not that bad so do not let $ scare you. You will be surprised at how you adapt! This year I am planting a garden, raising my chicken eggs etc.I have 35 acres..LOL Good luck to you and do what you think is correct for unschooling..read read read and you will feel better about it like I did! :) Pam <br/>

<br/>
Hi,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My name is Lori and I am a homeschooling Mom of two years to Christopher<br/>
<br/>
10, Lily 8, Emma 5, and Matthew 2. I live in Connecticut and my husband<br/>
<br/>
and I work opposite each other so we can be home with our children. I<br/>
<br/>
work two 10 hour shifts each week and he is self employed and works on<br/>
<br/>
the days I am off. When he does not have work I will pick up extra at<br/>
<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We currently do an eclectic type of cirruculum with the kids. Math from<br/>
<br/>
here, language from there..etc. I think they are learning from some of<br/>
<br/>
what they are doing but not from everything they are doing. I guess I<br/>
<br/>
feel some of what they are doing is a waste of time for them because<br/>
<br/>
they are not learning from it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In my core I believe unschooling is the best way to learn. I am just<br/>
<br/>
afraid of the following and hoped some of the seasoned unschoolers out<br/>
<br/>
there could give me some advice that would maybe ease my mind so we<br/>
<br/>
could try unschooling. Ok here is my not all inclusive list of fears...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. With four kids and working opposite each other, and money issues my<br/>
<br/>
husband and I are a bit stressed to say the least. I am worried that<br/>
<br/>
either of us will not have the time to foster what each of their<br/>
<br/>
interests are as there are four of them and only one of us at a time and<br/>
<br/>
we have no family support. When we are home there is so much to be done<br/>
<br/>
that I feel to unschool effectively you need to have alot of extra time<br/>
<br/>
to devote to your kids passions. Please don&#39;t get me wrong it is not<br/>
<br/>
that we don&#39;t want to have the extra time the reality is that very often<br/>
<br/>
there is just many other things to do ie, cooking, cleaning, laundry,<br/>
<br/>
shopping, paying bills, bookwork for the business etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. We have no extra money to buy resources for them to persue their<br/>
<br/>
passions. There are many things they would like to do (places to go) or<br/>
<br/>
buy and we just don&#39;t have the finances to do this for them. I just feel<br/>
<br/>
like if we can&#39;t provide these things for them they will not be able to<br/>
<br/>
learn the things they could if we were able to provide more for them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. What if they don&#39;t learn...there is no turning back...I can&#39;t get<br/>
<br/>
those years back for them...what if they are disadvantaged for life. I<br/>
<br/>
believe if they had the resources (see #2) they could learn but without<br/>
<br/>
them I am not sure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4. Can the state penilize you for unschooling. We live in Connecticut<br/>
<br/>
for now...(thinking about relocating to Florida)...CT is very easy on<br/>
<br/>
homeschooling but I still worry if it gets out that we unschool that we<br/>
<br/>
could get in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So that is bascially it...time, money, big brother and once commited not<br/>
<br/>
getting the years back if it doesn&#39;t work...those are my main<br/>
<br/>
fears...Side note...I have anxiety issues so if these seem unrealistic<br/>
<br/>
they may be..I tend to worry about EVERYTHING!! !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I would love any personal stories, words of encouragement, helpful<br/>
<br/>
hints or anything that may help me so I could do what I really want to<br/>
<br/>
do in my heart. Unschooling makes sense to me, it feels right...I just<br/>
<br/>
have to get past these fears and have some peace and then I think we<br/>
<br/>
would be okay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to babble... [:)]<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Lori<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049908873">NO you can&#39;t be penalized - as far as the state goes, you are &quot;homeschooling&quot; and in CT, you have no paperwork to turn in to the state. HOW you &quot;homeschool&quot; is irrelevant to them. There are TONS of unschoolers in CT simply because it is sooooo easy - no tests, no portfolios, no Notice of Intent required. There&#39;s a whole yahoo group of unschoolers even (TribeUSCT - Tribe of Unschoolers in CT). We&#39;ve been unschooling in CT since DS was 18 months old (That&#39;s when we moved back up here again after DH graduated college). He&#39;s now 10 ½. <br/>
<br/>
Also, you don&#39;t need to &quot;get back&quot; years - what someone needs to know/learn can be learned when they need it. You don&#39;t need to spend 12 years on math - you can learn all of it from scratch (and few people are ever really at &quot;scratch&quot;) in a year, maybe less, if you WANT to and NEED to in order to reach your own goals.<br/>
<br/>
Re-evaluate what you consider &quot;Resources&quot; - text books, museums, expensive curricula are NOT necessary. Dried beans, paper clips, the Internet (which I KNOW you have LOL), media of all sorts (Libraries are FREE) - those are all resources. So is the next door neighbor and a whole host of homeschooling and unschooling families around the state. Don&#39;t forget things like Freecycle, the library, the Internet, bartering, etc as ways to access resources as well. For instance, someone on the CT-CHEER (CT Home Educators East of the River) Yahoo group posted that she was looking for a toy that she couldn&#39;t remember the name of but gave a description. Someone else said &quot;Oh, that&#39;s called Gears Gears Gears...&quot; At which point, I said &quot;Hey, we&#39;ve got that and it&#39;s in the pile of stuff we&#39;re getting rid of - do you want it?&quot; This family got a full set, new to them, gently used, for the cost of meeting us halfway to pick it up.<br/>
<br/>
Set priorities - yeah, keeping the bookwork for a business is important but can it be &quot;maintained&quot; in 30 minutes while the kids are watching a movie or otherwise occupied (maybe when the littlest ones are asleep)? Cooking and cleaning can be done such that the kids can be involved (not forcibly but as in &quot;hey I&#39;m going to be folding laundry, anyone want to watch a movie with me while I work?&quot; ) Clean in 15 minute increments in between other things. Cook once a week and reheat the rest of the week. For instance, instead of cooking chicken two nights (at the 30 minutes or so that takes each time), cook a dozen chicken breasts at once then stash 2/3 of them. Voila, 5 minutes to heat up the chicken later on in the week and you&#39;ve got the makings for a stir fry. For that matter, how do you find the time to sit-down textbook school 4 kids AND do all this other stuff? Unschooling is more AND less time consuming than that stuff. Use the time you currently are setting aside for the sit down work (lesson planning, correcting work, doing lessons, etc). It might well be worthwhile to consider things like Peapod grocery delivery - you place the order online, set the delivery time window (usually a 2 hour window like 8 am - 10 am), they bring it right in to the kitchen table, you can use coupons and other discounts and pay by cash or check or credit card as you choose (you&#39;re not limited as to how to pay so you can write a check just as if you were at the store). The delivery charge compared to the value of your time may be worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Set financial priorities as well (not that that is news to you) - take the textbook money that you are already spending and put it toward whatever stuff they WANT to do. Memberships to things like the aquarium, children&#39;s museum, etc are GREAT holiday gifts from family (makes them feel like they&#39;re doing something &quot;educational&quot; for the kids and that&#39;s a Good Thing LOL). Magazine subscriptions too are a great gift, can be targeted to individual interests, include &quot;reading&quot; and other &quot;educational&quot; stuff like that - aunties and grandmas can feel good that they&#39;re &quot;helping&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-237734351">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just want to thank everyone who responded with compassion, great <br/>
ideas and support. My husband is all for this except he thinks they <br/>
should do times tables..lol..I am sure you have heard that before. I <br/>
am glad to hear that others do this without a lot of money!<br/>
<br/>
I think CT is a really good state for homeschooling as there does not <br/>
seem to be the regualtions in other states. Although it is a very <br/>
expensive state to live in. With that said my husband really wants to <br/>
move to Florida. I know a couple of you from Florida seem to think <br/>
that the job situation down there is not the greatest. (and the gangs <br/>
didn&#39;t thrill me either!) I am a nurse and my husband is a painter<br/>
(house, etc...not canvas). I know the cost of living maybe less down <br/>
there but I think the pay is considerably less. Any thoughts on this <br/>
from the Floridians? Do you know what nurses or painters make and if <br/>
there are even jobs for either one available. I don&#39;t want to be the <br/>
main bread winner as I want to be home with the kids as much as <br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
Hubby and I are going to talk again today and try to make a decision <br/>
about unschooling. If do something like give it a try, any <br/>
suggestions on how long is a reasonable length of time to fairly try <br/>
it...I don&#39;t want to not give it enough time as I think that may be <br/>
unfair as I have read about deschooling and I am assuming this <br/>
process is different for each individual. Does six months sound like <br/>
a fair amount of time to try it out? I would like your opinions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all of you help. It really is appreciated!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;rule of thumb&quot; in deschooling is one month per year your child has been in school. But *each time* you or your husband &quot;backslide&quot; and ask about the multiplication tables &lt;g&gt; or some other &quot;schooly&quot; issue, you need to go back to day ONE in your counting. It will probably take you and your husband longer to deschool than your children (one month per year *you* were schooled); so you will, more than likely, backslide more than a few times in six months.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6042972">Oh gosh, Kelly is right!<br/>
<br/>
For us it took TWO years to deschool my son. Part of that was due to  <br/>
the fact that he is very sensitive and school was very stressful for  <br/>
him. We threw ourselves headlong into it, and it still took that much  <br/>
time, so I can&#39;t imagine what time frame we would have been looking  <br/>
at if we had restarted with backslides. It&#39;s very much the same with  <br/>
Breanna, although she has special needs and had been in school full  <br/>
time since she was three.<br/>
<br/>
Now the girls, they were deschooled in a matter of two months, but  <br/>
they only spent two years and one year, respectively. They had grown  <br/>
up being in a school building though, due to my intense involvement,  <br/>
so it was very hard for them to lose what they perceived as a very  <br/>
important daily ritual. My oldest two even did summer school! So from  <br/>
birth on, the girls had been brought up to the building, spent hours  <br/>
in the library or office playing, chatting, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds like he&#39;s thinking they won&#39;t ever have any interest in <br/>
learning about multiplication on their own. The younger children <br/>
almost certainly will if they aren&#39;t ever pushed to learn it - its <br/>
useful, after all, and kids are naturally motivated to learn things <br/>
that are useful and helpful. Its also fun for many many children to <br/>
play with numbers and the patterns they form. <br/>
<br/>
If the older kids have been pushed to learn some &quot;math&quot; they may be <br/>
less enthusiastic for awhile - but even that will fade with some <br/>
deschooling. My 15yo hated anything that seemed &quot;schoolish&quot; for a <br/>
long time after he left school, but nowadays he does a good bit with <br/>
numbers. He does some woodworking, metalworking and working for <br/>
cash ;) so various kinds of mathematics have become practical to him.<br/>
<br/>
Something to keep in mind with math is that the sequence its <br/>
generally taught - in schools and most curricula - isn&#39;t necessarily <br/>
the sequence in which children naturally become interested in and <br/>
learn those concepts. An example that&#39;s fresh in my mind, from <br/>
chatting with another mom yesterday, is that its not necessary to <br/>
learn basic addition and subtraction before multiplication and/or <br/>
division. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a fair amount of time to try it out?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Six months from now takes you to the start of the next &quot;school year&quot;. <br/>
That&#39;s setting yourself up in the worst possible way - there&#39;s a <br/>
delicate transition that will happen the first time you cross that <br/>
magic line in your expectations between &quot;summer vacation&quot; and &quot;school <br/>
time&quot;. Its not uncommon to feel a little panicky right around then, <br/>
especially since mom and dad will still be deschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Give it all the next &quot;school year&quot; at least. Spend the first six <br/>
months connecting more deeply with the kids, have fun together! And <br/>
at the same time, do more reading about unschooling and, if you like <br/>
that sort of thing, about learning and cognition in general. If you <br/>
need goals, set some for yourself - read about different <br/>
communication styles or Love Languages, or ways to facilitate problem <br/>
solving. <br/>
<br/>
If you feel a need to &quot;keep track&quot; in some way (or maybe dh does) <br/>
create a portfolio of some kind - a blog, perhaps, or a photo album <br/>
or a journal - include pictures and stories from the day, but don&#39;t <br/>
put any emphasis on &quot;learning&quot;. Emphasize &quot;this was fun&quot; and &quot;this is <br/>
how we found a solution together&quot; and &quot;this is how I&#39;m becoming a <br/>
kinder parent.&quot; Encourage dh to do the same, so you can connect <br/>
better with each other about your days and experiences with the kids, <br/>
especially if you&#39;re not often home at the same times.<br/>
<br/>
Think and talk about your core values/ guiding principles. Work on <br/>
living by those principles - not &quot;applying&quot; them to the kids, but as <br/>
a guide for how you, personally make decisions. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-864500631">Since you all were talking about math, my 8 yo has actually asked for a math program so that he can understand math better.  He naturally leans that way, but just because we unschool doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t use traditional curriculum when it is child-directed.  I went on the internet and evaluated several options and talked (a little - he&#39;s 8 remember) about what they entail.  Now, we use RightStart Mathematics and he LOVES it.  It is very untraditional, uses an abacus and word pictures, and he asks to do it at least 3 times a week.  Obviously, this costs money and isn&#39;t in everyone&#39;s budget, but it is the only &quot;curriculum&quot; thing that we use and it is by his choice.  If no other child shows interest we will sell it on eBay or something because it has a high value.<br/>
On another note, we have never pushed math and he is naturally trying to work things out in his head and on a calculator.  Because we don&#39;t believe in pushing them in a direction, even though everyone around us disagrees, my 5 yo has now become interested in math.  He came to me last week and informed me that 3+2=5 and so does 4+1.  We talked about math for about 10 minutes and did different word problems that he was enjoying but after 10 minutes his interest faded, so we stopped.  Now, about every day, he asks one or two math related questions and is loving it.  I know if he were in the school he would be sick of it by now.  Memorizing math facts is one of the &quot;worst&quot; ways to learn math and only encourages those that understand numbers and memorize well.  Most kids do not function that way.<br/>
 <br/>
This is probably, in my opinion, the area that we get the most grief from non-unschoolers about.  They say, &quot;How are they going to learn their math facts?&quot;  I kindly point out that there are other ways to learn math that apply to life and we capitalize on these when the kids are interested.<br/>

My husband is all for this except he thinks they &gt; should do times tables..lol..I am sure you have heard that before. It sounds like he&#39;s thinking they won&#39;t ever have any interest in learning about multiplication on their own. The younger children almost certainly will if they aren&#39;t ever pushed to learn it - its useful, after all, and kids are naturally motivated to learn things that are useful and helpful. Its also fun for many many children to play with numbers and the patterns they form. If the older kids have been pushed to learn some &quot;math&quot; they may be less enthusiastic for awhile - but even that will fade with some deschooling. My 15yo hated anything that seemed &quot;schoolish&quot; for a long time after he left school, but nowadays he does a good bit with numbers. He does some woodworking, metalworking and working for cash ;) so various kinds of mathematics have become practical to him.Something to keep in mind with math is that the sequence its generally taught - in schools and most curricula - isn&#39;t necessarily the sequence in which children naturally become interested in and learn those concepts. An example that&#39;s fresh in my mind, from chatting with another mom yesterday, is that its not necessary to learn basic addition and subtraction before multiplication and/or division. &gt; Hubby and I are going to talk again today and try to make a decision &gt; about unschooling.

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
We have been talking with a number of people about getting a play group<br/>
together. We thought we would start with twice a month. We will be at the<br/>
meeting on Monday and would love to talk there with calendars in hand to<br/>
figure out some good dates.<br/>
<br/>
Info about Monday&#39;s meeting again:<br/>
<br/>
Please join us next Monday, February 16, at 7 pm at the Borders Book<br/>
Store in Norwalk (on Rte. 7 - just before the border to Wilton) for a<br/>
friendly and very informal get-together.<br/>
<br/>
There are often children there: reading or looking at books, playing<br/>
board games, etc. Send the word if you plan to bring yours along and<br/>
would like to invite others or at least find out if others will be<br/>
there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611635699">Hi Lori, <br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Hartford, Connecticut and also Granby, but moved to Miami<br/>
twelve years ago and never looked back (but that was worked for me<br/>
:)). It&#39;s very unschooling/homeschooling friendly here. But I&#39;d like<br/>
to ask what your reasons are for moving other than jobs (actually I&#39;d<br/>
love to know what type of work you&#39;re looking for sorry if I missed it<br/>
in the original post). My husband is French and moved here for the<br/>
same reasons I did. We moved away for a year to Argentina and then a<br/>
couple of other places before returning to Florida. We were super<br/>
happy to back in Miami because we really missed the tropical weather,<br/>
palm trees, and the international flavor since our daughter is being<br/>
raised trilingually. So I&#39;m not sure where in Florida you&#39;re thinking<br/>
of moving to but I was wondering if it was the weather or jobs or some<br/>
other reason. <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of homeschool groups all over Florida, unschoolers are<br/>
often part of the groups as well. We have a great group in Miami with<br/>
a mix of home and unschoolers and also one in Fort Lauderdale.<br/>
If I can help you with anything please let me know :)<br/>

&gt; (house, etc...not canvas). I know the cost of living maybe less down <br/>
&gt; there but I think the pay is considerably less. Any thoughts on this <br/>
&gt; from the Floridians? Do you know what nurses or painters make and if <br/>
&gt; there are even jobs for either one available. I don&#39;t want to be the <br/>
&gt; main bread winner as I want to be home with the kids as much as <br/>
&gt; possible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hubby and I are going to talk again today and try to make a decision <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-718978531">Laura and Nance,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info. Here is the whole story on Florida although it <br/>
may be more info than you want..lol<br/>
<br/>
We live in CT and my husband was born and raised here...my family <br/>
moved alot but we spent about 12 of my 18 years in CT...and Tom and I <br/>
have spent 10 more here...so we both know CT very well...however he <br/>
went to FL alot growing up to his grandmother&#39;s house in Hallandale <br/>
and we both lived in Fort Lauderdale for about eight months and Boca <br/>
another month. <br/>
<br/>
CT is very expensive and the taxes are very high...at least it seems <br/>
that way to us...although we may be wrong...<br/>
Mortgage including taxes which are $6000/yr and homeowners which is <br/>
$1100/yr but we have a cottage too on the property which is part of <br/>
the reason our house is so hard to sell..is $2500/mo for a four <br/>
bedroom expanded cape...like I said we also have a cottage which was <br/>
falling apart when we bought the house so it doesn&#39;t really factor <br/>
into the mortgage as it was a reason people would not want to have <br/>
bought the house...not a selling point...:o)<br/>
<br/>
Car insurance is about $1800/yr two cars 2004 Honda Pilot and 2005 <br/>
Scion XB<br/>
<br/>
Electric is around $150-200/mo depending on the time of year..we do <br/>
not use our AC because it costs so much<br/>
<br/>
Oil right now is $2/gal and we average $300/mo Nov-April at these <br/>
prices at the end of the summer the prices were $4.50/gal We keep our <br/>
house at 65 degrees and we are freezing...<br/>
<br/>
I think food is expensive milk is $4/gal at the regular grocery store <br/>
Bread ~$2/loaf<br/>
<br/>
Our sales tax is 6% but not on food or clothes up to $50<br/>
<br/>
We also have state income tax which I think is about 4%<br/>
<br/>
Like I said I am a nurse and work is not hard to find for me however, <br/>
I don&#39;t mind contributing to the household but I don&#39;t want to work <br/>
full time and have my husband Mr. Mom and as the kids get older he <br/>
doesn&#39;t either. He is a painter and we have gone months before where <br/>
he has no work and even when he does have work we struggle to make <br/>
ends meet. So with the economy the way it is we are trying to sell <br/>
our house and buy something that has a smaller mortgage. I have an <br/>
uncle in Fort Myers who lives in a development and the have to paint <br/>
their homes every X number of years because to the requirements to <br/>
live in the development. My husbands theory is that he will be able <br/>
to get work via word of mouth by my uncle. The hope would be that I <br/>
could get a part time position as an RN.<br/>
<br/>
We both hate the cold weather and even the kids don&#39;t seem to like it <br/>
much. My husband has psoriosis so he does better in the warm weather.<br/>
<br/>
I think we would all be happy in FL I am just concerned about the <br/>
financial end of it...<br/>
<br/>
And by the way we are going to unschool...I hate to think how many <br/>
times I will backslide but I am excited to begin the process...<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s to deschooling!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone who has give advice etc. I am sure I will have a <br/>
ton of questions as we progress through this new journey.<br/>

Hi Lori, <br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Hartford, Connecticut and also Granby, but moved to Miami<br/>
twelve years ago and never looked back (but that was worked for me<br/>
:)). It&#39;s very unschooling/ homeschooling friendly here. But I&#39;d like<br/>
to ask what your reasons are for moving other than jobs (actually I&#39;d<br/>
love to know what type of work you&#39;re looking for sorry if I missed it<br/>
in the original post). My husband is French and moved here for the<br/>
same reasons I did. We moved away for a year to Argentina and then a<br/>
couple of other places before returning to Florida. We were super<br/>
happy to back in Miami because we really missed the tropical weather,<br/>
palm trees, and the international flavor since our daughter is being<br/>
raised trilingually. So I&#39;m not sure where in Florida you&#39;re thinking<br/>
of moving to but I was wondering if it was the weather or jobs or some<br/>
other reason. <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of homeschool groups all over Florida, unschoolers are<br/>
often part of the groups as well. We have a great group in Miami with<br/>
a mix of home and unschoolers and also one in Fort Lauderdale.<br/>
If I can help you with anything please let me know :)<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Hubby and I are going to talk again today and try to make a decision <br/>

&gt; suggestions on how long is a reasonable length of time to fairly try <br/>
&gt; it...I don&#39;t want to not give it enough time as I think that may be <br/>
&gt; unfair as I have read about deschooling and I am assuming this <br/>
&gt; process is different for each individual. Does six months sound like <br/>
&gt; a fair amount of time to try it out? I would like your opinions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-571606466">One of my (new) favourite pro-unschooling pieces of evidence is the <br/>
essay, A Mathematician&#39;s Lament, by Paul Lockhart. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf</a><br/>
<br/>
I think this should be required reading, definitely for every <br/>
unschooling family, (and yes, &lt;G&gt; I see the irony in &quot;required <br/>
reading&quot; ... for unschoolers &lt;G&gt;) but also for any parent.  For <br/>
anyone who considers themselves a connaisseur of anything.  Lockhart <br/>
speaks about the eloquence of mathematics the way a sommelier talks <br/>
about the depth and dimension of wine, the way a composer talks about <br/>
the provacative seduction of music, the way a painter talks about the <br/>
magic of light play on a wheatfield ... .<br/>
<br/>
This essay not only changed the way I -- a wordsmith, NOT a numbers <br/>
passionista -- thought about the &quot;But what about math&quot; myth but also <br/>
gave me a new appreciation for the mathematic arts in toto.  <br/>
Lockhart&#39;s adoration for the object of his devotion is as resonating <br/>
as is my adoration of a clever turn of phrase, or a well used semi-<br/>
colon.<br/>
<br/>
I reference his essay in the Mathematics chapter in the book I&#39;m <br/>
writing, which is an A-Z series of essays featuring anecdotes from <br/>
our unschooling journey AND wheelbarrows full of referential <br/>
resources affirming the scientific, social, metaphysical and <br/>
anthropological evidence pro-unschooling.  My working title is <br/>
Alphabet Soup:  26 Essays About Our Life Without School.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a manuscript clip:<br/>
<br/>
(Confidential to you &lt;G&gt; because it&#39;s yet unpublished ... soon <br/>
though!)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve begun to theorize that the &quot;But what about math&quot; fear <br/>
associated with following a child-led approach to learning is one of <br/>
the greatest unschooling myths out there, perhaps second only to <br/>
the &quot;But what about socialization&quot; question associated with <br/>
homeschooling in general.  The mainstream belief about a well-rounded <br/>
K-12 education assumes that, at some point, every student needs to <br/>
learn algebra  and there&#39;s no way to imagine that trigonometry et. <br/>
al. will be organically encountered the way, for instance, geography, <br/>
history, and semi-colons might come to be stumbled upon along an <br/>
unschooly path.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Before I get too far along my musings about whether or not <br/>
curriculized mathematics are necessary, and later, how functional <br/>
mathematics occur organically in life anyway, I must pause to <br/>
celebrate Paul Lockhart&#39;s A Mathematician&#39;s Lament .  This essay  <br/>
besides being my new favourite must-read recommendation for <br/>
unschoolers and, well, anyone with a pulse  is a brilliant exposé <br/>
lamenting the pedantic and incongruous way mathematics has been <br/>
dissected into particulate bits of formulas and &quot;a senseless <br/>
bouillabaisse of disconnected topics&quot;.  Lockhart&#39;s devotion to <br/>
the &quot;breathtaking depth and heartbreaking beauty in this ancient art <br/>
form&quot; exalts mathematics as a fine art the way only a truly <br/>
impassioned connoisseur could.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He says it is &quot;ironic that people dismiss mathematics as the <br/>
antithesis of creativity.  They are missing out on an art form older <br/>
than any book, more profound than any poem, and more abstract than <br/>
any abstract.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&quot;And,&quot; he emphasizes, &quot;It is school (emphasis his) that has done <br/>
this!  What a sad endless cycle of innocent teachers inflicting <br/>
damage upon innocent students.  We could all be having so much more <br/>
fun.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;While my premise herein might could be a questioning of whether <br/>
sophisticated mathematics principles warrant the attention of every K-<br/>
12-aged person, Lockhart&#39;s thesis is that mathematics are eloquent <br/>
expressions of creative possibility.  Not unlike musical composition, <br/>
or fine art painting.  And that subjugating students into indentured <br/>
servitude to Mathematic Programs of Study is as stifling as it is <br/>
tragic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
... and the chapter goes on from there ...<br/>
<br/>
I used to shy away from the &quot;But what about math&quot; wonderings most <br/>
skeptics of unschooling spar with.  Because I was uncertain <br/>
myself ... what ABOUT math?  Now I&#39;m to the point that the &quot;But what <br/>
about math&quot; question is one of my preferred soapboxes.  It&#39;s just <br/>
ridiculous to imagine that every human being needs to know <br/>
pythagorus&#39; theory ... or any of the other formulaic bits that are <br/>
poured into us in the school system&#39;s jug and mug approach to <br/>
teaching/learning.  Now, thanks to Lockhart&#39;s essay, I not only think <br/>
it&#39;s ridiculous to subjugate every unique individual to a single <br/>
static Program of Studies, I also think it&#39;s an abomination to have <br/>
the art of mathematics bastardized the way it is in schools.  I&#39;d be <br/>
as offended if music was deconstructed and systematically forced onto <br/>
every single student.<br/>
<br/>
Hurrah for unschooling liberty!<br/>
<br/>
loving,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; This is probably, in my opinion, the area that we get the most<br/>

I can attest to this. My 5 yr old son is exploding with mathematics<br/>
left and right and is ALL over the place right now. He is discovering<br/>
and figuring out adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing AND basic<br/>
algebra ALL at the same time. A couple days ago he says to me, &quot;3<br/>
groups of 3 or 3 times 3 is the same as 3 plus 3 plus 3...which equals<br/>
9, I think.&quot; I simply agreed and smiled. He also informed me back when<br/>
he was about 3.5 yrs old that &quot;A+B=C&quot; and I said, &quot;it sure can in<br/>
certain cases&quot; to which he replied, &quot;If A=1 and B=2, then C=3 and<br/>
1+2=3&quot;. It was then that I found out he had assigned each letter of<br/>
the alphabet it&#39;s number and was playing around with how to get from<br/>
one letter (number) to another.<br/>

I would say you&#39;ll have many of the same high expenses in South<br/>
Florida minus the state income tax. House and car insurance can be<br/>
high as well as taxes but it depends a lot upon where you are in<br/>
particular. Figure you&#39;ll have a higher bill 2/3 of the year for ac<br/>
but then really no heat in the winter and lots of great weather. There<br/>
are hurricanes of course but then again I will take those any day over<br/>
blizzards, ice storms and other freaky storms and it&#39;s actually humid<br/>
but over all without the humidity it would be actually cooler here :)<br/>
I have a friend who is in nursing and she says there are still plenty<br/>
of jobs.<br/>
Overall you could probably get a decent price on a house at this point<br/>
although the housing market still isn&#39;t at the bottom but there are<br/>
deals to be had.<br/>
As I also said before, lots of homeschooling groups and some<br/>
unschoolers as well and very homeschool friendly here.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on your research, I hope you find everything you&#39;re looking<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187154976">LOL yeah - there was a point several years ago when DS wanted me to make<br/>
him &quot;number quizzes&quot; on a daily basis. So, I&#39;d ask how many questions he<br/>
wanted and how big the numbers should be and so on. Then I&#39;d write up a<br/>
quiz for him to do at will (no set time and not &quot;timed&quot;). Once he was<br/>
done, he&#39;d show it to me to see if he got it all correct. We also had<br/>
addition and multiplication tables 1-10 on the kitchen chalkboard for<br/>
the longest time, by his request, so he could find answers himself<br/>
without having to ask us. We even picked up a book that starts at<br/>
counting and goes through geometry and statistics, in short explanatory<br/>
sections (2 to 3 pages max per topic), no &quot;exercises&quot; or anything, just<br/>
the &quot;how to&quot;, that he can reference at will.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575029688">Just watch Numb3rs a few times to see the art and pattern and beauty in,<br/>
well, numbers. There&#39;s a creativity and artistry in seeing numbers and<br/>
applying their principles to answering questions about life, the<br/>
universe, and everything.<br/>
<br/>
Many people WILL indeed need to know various geometric theorems BUT they<br/>
can learn them when they need them. Spent about 15 minutes discussing pi<br/>
with 10 yr old DS yesterday. He knows that pi = 3.14159 (but it never<br/>
actually ends and you can make an android/robot go crazy by asking it to<br/>
tell you the last digit of pi lol) I showed him how it got invented when<br/>
someone noticed that no matter how big or small a circle was, the<br/>
relationship between the radius and the area always came down to that<br/>
number. He knew &quot;pi*r^2&quot; because that&#39;s one of those old &quot;family jokes&quot;<br/>
&quot;Pi r square...No silly corn bread r square, pie r round&quot; LOL So I just<br/>
showed him that if you have any two of the three bits (area, radius, pi)<br/>
you can figure out the other one - A=pi*r^2; pi=A/r^2; r^2=A/pi<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a &quot;Planned&quot; lesson, it was just something that popped up out<br/>
of discussion about something else.<br/>
<br/>
One of the &quot;issues&quot; with the standard school math approach is that it<br/>
assumes that adding or the Pythagorean theorem or whatever is an end in<br/>
itself. It&#39;s not. Those are all tools, just like a hammer or a drill.<br/>
They are useful for certain purposes and when you need them, it&#39;s handy<br/>
to know how to use them but you can learn to use them right then, you<br/>
don&#39;t have to have &quot;Hammering&quot; practice every day for several years,<br/>
with lessons and tests and all, in order to use that tool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319191606">--Here are some hints and my philosophy:<br/>
<br/>
HOW TO BEGIN UNSCHOOLING...<br/>
<br/>
 Have a wonder-filled week.<br/>
Just begin...a look at beginning to homeschool/unschooling....<br/>
 In the ensuing days, take hikes or have picnics; do the things you<br/>
could not do when  he/she was in school.<br/>
 Get to know each other well. Enjoy being his parent and help him<br/>
enjoy being your child. He will soon respond favorably to being treated<br/>
in a more mature fashion than he was in the school world. If you talk<br/>
to him<br/>
 with your faith and belief in him showing through, he will rise to<br/>
your expectations.<br/>
 Give it time, lots of timemaybe even a year. Your day is now<br/>
determined more by the rising and setting of the sun than by clocks<br/>
and schedules.<br/>
 You aren&#39;t in the hamster-wheel anymore, so let it sink in . . . and<br/>
enjoy it! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
