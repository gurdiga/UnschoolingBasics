<div id="ygrps-yiv-358812217">Thanks all...I do keep an almost daily written log and hang onto <br/>
brochures (my almost 8 yr old is not alone...I have three more younger <br/>
than him) and we take lots of pictures of creations and projects.  I <br/>
just didn&#39;t think that would be enough to &quot;prove&quot; anything to someone <br/>
else.  I will try to find an unschool friendly reviewer and/or I will <br/>
look into that Excelsior Academy.<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

&quot;unusual&quot; documentation of homeschooling.  I know some very schoolish<br/>
homeschoolers who still document their work via pictures, art<br/>
projects, theatre stubs and scrapbooks.<br/>
