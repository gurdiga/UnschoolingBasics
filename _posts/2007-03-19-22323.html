<div id="ygrps-yiv-726610918">in our journey in &#39;unschooling&#39; we are facing hard times!<br/>
<br/>
our families are giving us hard time, both my family and my husband&#39;s<br/>
family. I am truely shocked how they are trying to manipulate us into<br/>
getting our son, Shalom back to school.<br/>
If you remember me, its us whom the school expelled Shalom based on<br/>
vaccination issues. more info is on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://myspace.com/nurturinghome">http://myspace.com/nurturinghome</a><br/>
in our blog under the subject &#39;our principal is trying to force us to<br/>
vaccinate our son&#39;<br/>
Shalom is still &#39;deschooling&#39; tending to look at movies in the<br/>
computer he somehow learned to type in google videos, which requires<br/>
reading. Based on it, I assume he is in reading level of first grade<br/>
(he is 5 years old)<br/>
Shalom is sad he was expelled from school and misses school. So<br/>
sticking to &#39;unschooling&#39; principle, I would happily send him back to<br/>
school if the school will only let us! <br/>
Our family researched for other schools and found other school in our<br/>
area. But the principal in our school got angry as he googled and<br/>
found my posting in myspace.  He tries to spread about us lies that we<br/>
are trouble makers, to ensure no other schools will want to accept<br/>
Shalom. His purpose is to get us to give up, then vaccinate Shalom<br/>
then beg them to accept him back to HIS school. Or simply to take<br/>
revenge. I have no idea.<br/>
Now no school wants to accept Shalom. We don&#39;t care. we would be happy<br/>
to unschool! But our son told me he misses school so much and wants to<br/>
go back to school.<br/>
<br/>
Our family are frantically calling all of the schools in the area<br/>
begging them to let our son to any of them. We are not the ones to do<br/>
these calls! Once we visited my parents. my son asked us permission to<br/>
stay over my parents few days. We didn&#39;t mind as we knew my dad is<br/>
good with music and he goes to differnt places that might interest our<br/>
son.<br/>
So he stayed over my parents few days until we came to visit again in<br/>
the weekend. I saw a change in Shalom&#39;s behavior. He looks sadder and<br/>
has more temper tarnturms than he ever had before. I see fear in his<br/>
eyes! <br/>
Our parents lectured us about trying to meet various schools in their<br/>
area even its 45 minutes - 1 hour away from our house. they offered us<br/>
to leave Shalom in their house. (which doesn&#39;t make sense!! He has to<br/>
grow up in his parent&#39;s house not his grandparents!) They<br/>
alternativelly offered he will be driven back and forth from school to<br/>
our home, (which will end him needing to wake up really early in the<br/>
morning to get on the ride, then returning very late like at 8 - 10<br/>
pm! which again, doesn&#39;t make sense!!) When we pointed them these<br/>
issues, my parents offered us to move to their area, even my husband&#39;s<br/>
job is in our area, and the housing in their area is much more<br/>
expensive, and not to mention all of our friends are in our<br/>
neighborhood and not in theirs.<br/>
Then my parents got us meeting with the rabbi&#39;s wife (we are jews) in<br/>
the block. she also lectured us trying to persuade us to get him in a<br/>
school in their area. She offered an idea about another school in our<br/>
area. We told her that school was too stressfull, as we asked kids<br/>
from there they weren&#39;t happy, she pooh poohed it and said Shalom<br/>
needs a system, not being at home doing nothing.<br/>
I felt terrible about all of the privacy invasion. Everyone says they<br/>
are only helping us. They don&#39;t realize their help is unwanted!!! they<br/>
don&#39;t realize they are messing up with our sanity making us crazy!<br/>
They can offer help but not FORCE!<br/>
Anyway when we prepared to go home, Shalom started screaming he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go home. He started to panic and crying. When I asked<br/>
him what is the problem he sobbed saying that he has no school in our<br/>
home, and he will have school in my parent&#39;s area. (then i found out<br/>
my dad took our son to a school without telling us, registering there,<br/>
paying 600 dollars!) Then I realized he was brainwashed that being not<br/>
schooled is a terrible thing. Shalom looks so scared and lost. <br/>
Our parents and family have no idea what they are doing to us!!<br/>
When we took Shalom back home scraming and crying (knowing my mom will<br/>
tell my dad about this, then my dad will &#39;prove&#39; it as we are unfit to<br/>
be parents!)<br/>
When we arrived home, my husband found out in his pager his brother&#39;s<br/>
emails: His brother said in his emails: if you don&#39;t get your child<br/>
back to a school in the next few days, I am going to report you to the<br/>
social workers that we are neglecting our child by not getting him<br/>
into a school system.<br/>
we were shocked and don&#39;t know what to do! We are feeling invaded! we<br/>
feel pryed and disrespected. <br/>
I guess his brother allows himself to do this to us, because he helped<br/>
us financially to buy our house and car instead of the car that broke<br/>
down.<br/>
By the way a school that is in our area, another one a small one and<br/>
is more relaxed heared about us from more people, not from the school&#39;<br/>
s principal realized we are good people and not trouble makers so as<br/>
Shalom is begging us to let him go to school, it might work out. If<br/>
Shalom will change his mind and want to be unschooled, we will happily<br/>
let him to be! <br/>
Maybe they are treating us this way because we are a deaf couple? <br/>
<br/>
So what are your advices for the legal issues with my husband&#39;s<br/>
brother? about my and his family&#39;s invasing our lives? And how can I<br/>
help my poor child who was probably lectured and brainwashed.. and he<br/>
is so unhappy and fearfull and stressfull!!<br/>
help!<br/>
thank you if you could read it all!<br/>

What state are you in? I know most states allow philosophical and/or<br/>
religion as reasons not to vaccinate. as for reporting you for not<br/>
having him in school , again depends on your state but at 5 yo he is<br/>
probably not even of compulsory age yet anyway.<br/>
As for the family advice, I would politely tell them you will handle<br/>
this on your own, and don&#39;t allow them to manipulate you and interfere<br/>
in you and how your are raising your son,<br/>

I just saw your myspace and that you are in NJ......compulsory age is<br/>
6 yo and if Shalom is 5 yo your brother in law has no legal basis for<br/>
reporting your for not having him in school. He doesn&#39;t have to be<br/>
there. Also you are in one of the most relaxed states for homeschooling.<br/>
I don&#39;t think you have a thing to worry about.  Also I see there is a<br/>
bill pending allowing philosophical reasons not to vaccinate. Now your<br/>
state allows religious reasons, which I feel you can say apply to you.<br/>
Hang in there, you know what is best for your family!<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Our parents lectured us about trying to meet various schools in their<br/>
&gt; &gt; area even its 45 minutes - 1 hour away from our house. they offered us<br/>
&gt; &gt; to leave Shalom in their house. (which doesn&#39;t make sense!! He has to<br/>
&gt; &gt; grow up in his parent&#39;s house not his grandparents!) They<br/>
&gt; &gt; alternativelly offered he will be driven back and forth from school to<br/>
&gt; &gt; our home, (which will end him needing to wake up really early in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; morning to get on the ride, then returning very late like at 8 - 10<br/>
&gt; &gt; pm! which again, doesn&#39;t make sense!!) When we pointed them these<br/>
&gt; &gt; issues, my parents offered us to move to their area, even my husband&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; job is in our area, and the housing in their area is much more<br/>
&gt; &gt; expensive, and not to mention all of our friends are in our<br/>
&gt; &gt; neighborhood and not in theirs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Then my parents got us meeting with the rabbi&#39;s wife (we are jews) in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the block. she also lectured us trying to persuade us to get him in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; school in their area. She offered an idea about another school in our<br/>
&gt; &gt; area. We told her that school was too stressfull, as we asked kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; from there they weren&#39;t happy, she pooh poohed it and said Shalom<br/>
&gt; &gt; needs a system, not being at home doing nothing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I felt terrible about all of the privacy invasion. Everyone says they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are only helping us. They don&#39;t realize their help is unwanted!!! they<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t realize they are messing up with our sanity making us crazy!<br/>
&gt; &gt; They can offer help but not FORCE!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway when we prepared to go home, Shalom started screaming he<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t want to go home. He started to panic and crying. When I asked<br/>
&gt; &gt; him what is the problem he sobbed saying that he has no school in our<br/>
&gt; &gt; home, and he will have school in my parent&#39;s area. (then i found out<br/>
&gt; &gt; my dad took our son to a school without telling us, registering there,<br/>
&gt; &gt; paying 600 dollars!) Then I realized he was brainwashed that being not<br/>
&gt; &gt; schooled is a terrible thing. Shalom looks so scared and lost. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Our parents and family have no idea what they are doing to us!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; When we took Shalom back home scraming and crying (knowing my mom will<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell my dad about this, then my dad will &#39;prove&#39; it as we are unfit to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be parents!)<br/>
&gt; &gt; When we arrived home, my husband found out in his pager his brother&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; emails: His brother said in his emails: if you don&#39;t get your child<br/>
&gt; &gt; back to a school in the next few days, I am going to report you to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; social workers that we are neglecting our child by not getting him<br/>
&gt; &gt; into a school system.<br/>
&gt; &gt; we were shocked and don&#39;t know what to do! We are feeling invaded! we<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel pryed and disrespected. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess his brother allows himself to do this to us, because he helped<br/>
&gt; &gt; us financially to buy our house and car instead of the car that broke<br/>
&gt; &gt; down.<br/>
&gt; &gt; By the way a school that is in our area, another one a small one and<br/>
&gt; &gt; is more relaxed heared about us from more people, not from the school&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; s principal realized we are good people and not trouble makers so as<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shalom is begging us to let him go to school, it might work out. If<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shalom will change his mind and want to be unschooled, we will happily<br/>
&gt; &gt; let him to be! <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe they are treating us this way because we are a deaf couple? <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So what are your advices for the legal issues with my husband&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; brother? about my and his family&#39;s invasing our lives? And how can I<br/>
&gt; &gt; help my poor child who was probably lectured and brainwashed.. and he<br/>
&gt; &gt; is so unhappy and fearfull and stressfull!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; help!<br/>
&gt; &gt; thank you if you could read it all!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82067165">DO NOT SEND  YOUR CHILD WITH ANYONE while this is going on, and probably not for SEVERAL years. Show the family that you are responsible adults by taking charge.  Accept that these controlling people will NOT give you permission to live your own lives  and you must take back your lives without their permission. As to whether your brother can report you for not sending a 5 year old to school: this may depend on where you live. Where I live compulsory education starts at age 7 and no one can prove truancy or educational neglect below that age, BUT those who have bought into the system will pressure you and hope that you don&#39;t know the laws. I suggest joining Homeschool Legal Defense. They are a Christian group (just to let you know--they NEVER have asked my religious beliefs) that is very competent in defending legal cases  and helping fight off sicial workers. They have a 24-hour emergency line and recommend that if a social worker or truant officer arrives at your door that<br/>
 you hold them outside and call.  They will immediately take your call. They know the laws in all 50 states and the federal laws. Thy will tell the worker to leave and return witha court-issued warrant. They will defend you for free in court.  If you do not agree that your dh&#39;s (husband&#39;s) brother has purchased the right to run your lives, don&#39;t let him move an inch down that path. And consider yourself warned that his help may be a bid for control over you, and refuse it in the future. No objects are worth that. I&#39;d be willing to bet that your being deaf is a little part of this, to the extent that controlling families will take any perceived weakness and use it to tighten the chains. My family is controlling, too... I know. The weakness in me which they exploit in the name of help is my chronic disorganization. <br/>
   Your son must not be jerked around like this anymore. I have had to subtly teach my family that is they cause my children or me sadness they cannot have access to the kids.  I taught this in a way that works best for my family (since they aren&#39;t honest about not trusting me, and certainly don&#39;t see themselves as controlling, just &#39;wanting what&#39;s best for us&#39;).  I just refused invitations, became hard to find, did not invite them to my home. People like your family and mine do what thy do out of  FEAR. They think you are desperately wrong and that they must resue you and your children from this wrongness. My own parents acted like I was choosing to feed my son heroin. They grilled my kids on their knowlege and made my kids feel terribly insecure.  I regret letting them treat my kids that way one second, but as I had been raised to accept this control as love, and I do love them, that it took me a while to get it. Control is not love, it is negation of one&#39;s soul. X-ing a<br/>
 person out.<br/>
   Find out the laws of your state, both about legal refusal of immunizations and about truancy and homeschooling. Remember that if your son is under the age of compulsory attendance that no educational law is relevant. Take control. Don&#39;t let your husband give up his job, don&#39;t move, don&#39;t send your son away. He is very young. He is YOURS. What you tell him about this is up to YOU, but this doesn&#39;t need to be discussed like it&#39;s an emergency with him.  For now you choose to learn at home....And hey, you can give him a bilingual education (if he is hearing, he&#39;ll learn to sign and speak I&#39;ll bet). God gave this child to you not to your parents!  You can do this!!<br/>

My friend who homeschools a deaf 13 yo dd says there is a support group for deaf homeschooling  parents.  They may or may not be unschoolers.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745853823">Hello Sara,<br/>
<br/>
I can really feel your frustration and desperation!  Please take <br/>
heart, you can do this, and no one can stop you unless you let <br/>
them. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a FAQ from the NJ Department of Education.  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.state.nj.us/njded/genfo/overview/faq_homeschool.htm">http://www.state.nj.us/njded/genfo/overview/faq_homeschool.htm</a><br/>
It should clear up any misunderstanding your parents and your brother-<br/>
in-law have about what *they* can do to stop you.  <br/>
<br/>
I also suggest finding a homeschool group focused on NJ homeschool <br/>
issues, in case you need support from a professional organization.  <br/>
I&#39;m in Texas, but I found this group, it looks like they may be a <br/>
good place to start, but I&#39;m sure there are others, too. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/jerseyhome/">http://www.geocities.com/jerseyhome/</a><br/>
<br/>
As for the vaccines, that&#39;s tough in NJ because there is no current <br/>
exemption for &#39;reasons of conscience&#39;.  The religious angle may work, <br/>
but you&#39;d have to find a Rabbi to agree with you.  Look at the <br/>
National Vaccine Information Center&#39;s website for help and <br/>
information.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nvic.org/Default.htm">http://nvic.org/Default.htm</a>  Meanwhile, you may want to <br/>
stop putting your son in a position to have his immunization records <br/>
questioned...your obviously not going to get anywhere with the Rabbi <br/>
from his old school.  It may also be making him feel singled out to <br/>
be the point of contention of this issue.  I doubt you intend to make <br/>
him feel like he&#39;s somehow less than everyone else, but I don&#39;t think <br/>
his old school is above that kind of tactic to put pressure on you.  <br/>
Your choice not to vaccinate is for the benefit of your son&#39;s health, <br/>
and fighting with his school about it isn&#39;t healthy for him or you.<br/>
<br/>
If your son seems to want to go back to school, consider the <br/>
possibility that that desire is a reflection of all the chaos <br/>
surrounding the issue.  In his eyes, all of the tension and fighting <br/>
would stop if he could just go back to school.  I respect your wish <br/>
to respect your son, and allow him to decide if he wants to go to <br/>
school, there is nothing wrong with that.  Because there *is* so much <br/>
tension around this issue, give him some time to decompress, and keep <br/>
the people who are causing you problems away from him until he has <br/>
had that time.  It sounds to me like they are *using* your son and <br/>
his emotions to manipulate you. They can&#39;t be allow to do that, and <br/>
if they wont stop, they need to stay away from him. That&#39;s hard when <br/>
you live so close to so many relatives, but they can&#39;t be allowed to <br/>
be hurtful to your son *even if they mean well*.  Act the same way <br/>
you would if they were abusing him in any other way: Remove your son <br/>
from the situation, state your position on the issue, and give them <br/>
the space they need to decide if they want to make changes so they <br/>
can be part of your family&#39;s lives, or if they refuse to change at <br/>
the expense of their relationship with you and your family.<br/>
<br/>
Have faith in yourself and your son; it may take courage, but you <br/>
*really do know what&#39;s best for him*!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-941257968">Hi Sara, I am sorry to hear of your struggles. I can&#39;t imagine having to go<br/>
through what you have described. While my family does not understand my<br/>
choice to unschool (other than my Dad who is completely supportive!) they at<br/>
least leave us alone about it so far. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I read in one of the posts you are in NJ, is that correct? Have you joined<br/>
the NJ-unschooling yahoo group? There may be other people near you on that<br/>
list as well. I am in Burlington County NJ. There is also the NJIHS (new<br/>
jersey inclusive homeschoolers). <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope you can find more support for you and your family. I am a transplant<br/>
here so I am not totally familiar with the state or its resources here, I<br/>
wish I could offer more. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
By the way mandatory schooling ages in NJ are 6-16 so your family can not<br/>
&quot;report&quot; you for truancy. :-) Or rather they can try, but wouldn&#39;t be likely<br/>
to succeed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope things get better for you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-883374330"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;As for the vaccines, that&#39;s tough in NJ because there is no current<br/>
&gt;exemption for &#39;reasons of conscience&#39;.  The religious angle may work,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if this is necessarily so.  I don&#39;t know NJ laws regarding <br/>
vaccine exemptions but in NY where also you can only be exempt for religious <br/>
reasons however no one can not ask what religion you are.  So there is no <br/>
need to find a Rabbi or other religious official.  You simply state when <br/>
asked that you chose not to vacinate for religious reasons.  If someone asks <br/>
what religion, in NY, you can reply by informing them they are really not <br/>
supposed to ask that question.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As someone else here mentioned already, you are in one of the best states to<br/>
unschool in. I&#39;m wondering what resources you are currently availing<br/>
yourself of to help ease your son into homeschooling. There are many in your<br/>
area. I&#39;m in Essex County, right next door to you. There are several local<br/>
home/un-schooling yahoo groups that you can join to learn about the wide<br/>
variety of activities available. Perhaps if your son were to meet other kids<br/>
his age, he would start to feel more comfortable about not being in school.<br/>
Here are 3 links for local groups to start with:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746888278">hey, wow thank you for your helping! I am defiently going to join<br/>
these yahoo groups! I have an issue.. I have a bad habit to surf the<br/>
internet too much and not playing with my children enough. It was easy<br/>
when they were all in the school. I had the day for myself only. Now I<br/>
have to overcome my laziness and start be active with my son. My son<br/>
now is glueing himself to the computer games and movies.. now he is<br/>
researching a computer game that is for 6 years olds to 10 years olds.<br/>
one game was to connect numbered dots into a picture in increasing<br/>
difficulty levels. he done them..which requires him to read the<br/>
numbers correctly and connecting them in the right order. <br/>
Its hard to feel confident as to my family point of view it looks to<br/>
them my son is doing nothing and being addicted to the computer. I<br/>
want to start encouraging him to do more things.. and get myself off<br/>
the internet addiction! so we have a relatively good sized back yard.<br/>
I want to start a garden but have no idea where to start from! It<br/>
would be great to have us busy taking care of the garden growing food!<br/>
As well i wish to adopt a baby kitten. these things will keep my son<br/>
busy and less on the computer.<br/>
Where can I learn how to start a garden?<br/>
<br/>
By the way my house is facing a city park.. suppose I would make<br/>
weekly regular meetings in that park with the NJ area homeschoolers<br/>
families making friends, then if they feel comfortable then let them<br/>
coming in my house once weekly.. <br/>
is that done in homeschooling communities?<br/>
I guess many of my questions show my ignorance as I grew in extremely<br/>
mainstream background!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again!<br/>

You may want to check out the book &quot;All New Square Foot Gardening, Grow <br/>

from 2005 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://snipurl.com/1dlms">http://snipurl.com/1dlms</a> <br/>
I want to do this with  my boys as well.  I love to have home-grown <br/>

<br/>
Yes, try to get involved in some park days with other home/unschoolers <br/>
in your area.  That will help you gain confidence in your decision and <br/>
help your son too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260706654">We built square foot gardening boxes last summer - one about 4 off the <br/>
ground, one a little shorter (just for esthetic reasons). It was fun <br/>
just to build the boxes to start with. We had a bit of a disappointing <br/>
harvest but that was mostly due to the really weird weather we had - <br/>
long cold wet spring (we didn&#39;t get a clear warm weekend until well <br/>
into June - DS&#39; birthday is in early June and it poured buckets on his <br/>
birthday and didn&#39;t get above maybe mid 50s the whole day). We did get <br/>
lots of little carrots so we put them into a nice soup. The tomatoes <br/>
were just starting to be ready when -slap- chill autumn nights started <br/>
and an early frost and they were done for. We&#39;re hoping for better <br/>
