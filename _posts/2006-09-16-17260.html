<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262222407">&quot;They  could not let him in there- OSHA standards state no customers<br/>
allowed in  work area. The woman got really uptight and told my husband<br/>
that they don&#39;t  believe in telling their children &quot;no&quot;. He then said<br/>
that she went on a  little about self directed learning, and used some<br/>
of the words I use  (shows you how much men sometimes  listen).&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well....it shows a lack of  respect for a public place in my opinion,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to expect the whole world to have  their same values. If she thinks<br/>
everyone in the world is open to the idea  of letting kids be right<br/>
there while they work, she&#39;s sadly mistaken. Yeah,  it would be great,<br/>
but we&#39;re talking about a business,not a private  residence. He DOES<br/>
have to consider liabilty  issues.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
In this situation I think the mother could have done more to facilitate  the <br/>
children&#39;s experience.  If they were really interested in cars and how  they <br/>
work she might have been able to ask if he could bring out something small  <br/>
that the children could look at.  Or she could have asked around if anyone  there <br/>
works on their cars at home.  Might have been able to take the  children to <br/>
see someone working on cars *outside* the shop environment.  I  know a couple <br/>
of dads here that have *cars* as a hobby and are usually working  on them in <br/>
the backyard at some point during the week.   I am sure  there are more <br/>
solutions as well.<br/>
 <br/>
I think there are more answers than just yes or  no.  There is that place <br/>
where you can say *the law says that you can&#39;t go  in the shop where these people <br/>
are working on the cars..but lets talk about what  it is you are wanting to <br/>
see or do and find another way to work it out so you  get to do it*.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>
