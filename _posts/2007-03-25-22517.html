<div id="ygrps-yiv-416906877">Hi I all. I am Heather momma to 4 kiddos. 12yos, 7yod, 5yod, and 4yod.<br/>
 We have homeschooled for 8 years now. We have ran the gammut I am<br/>
sure.  Text books, work books, living book, units you name it we have<br/>
tried it.  But several times my husband and I have gone back to &quot;Well<br/>
we really think we should give unschooling a try.&quot; So we read up on it<br/>
again, and in so many ways agree with it, but because of our years of<br/>
other methods, I find it hard to get around it. How do ass a mother<br/>
who is normally more controlling and wanting to get this done and that<br/>
done- say its ok do whatever you want.  <br/>
<br/>
I am by no mean s rigid and sit down booky.  Espicially with my little<br/>
ones.  But I do have control to an extent although it is ecclectate<br/>
control :) I believe it will be easier to let the little ones choose,<br/>
because we already play games., and just do ton&#39;s of stuff they want<br/>
to do. But they of course don&#39;t know it would be considered &quot;school&quot; <br/>
I know we are to be be open to what are children want to do, and be<br/>
avl. to them.  But I have 3 little ones and sometimes the wanting<br/>
mommy is driving me crazy already. And if that is what we did all the<br/>
time(letting them decide what we do, when we do it) I could just go<br/>
wonky.  PLEASE someone if I am getting this wrong or if anyone has any<br/>
ideas for me. Throw them out there, I am here to gain knowledge from<br/>
you mothers who have been there done that.  <br/>
<br/>
I have had this guilt complex though, that my 7yo is not reading yet.<br/>
She really wants to know how and just will not click. But if I am<br/>
undrestanding correctly, if I was trying to unschool I wouldn&#39;t worry<br/>
so much about it. And just help her when she wants, and read with her<br/>
and to her and it will naturally? Is this correct.  <br/>
<br/>
For my 13yos it is going to proove to be harder to let go for me. He<br/>
now does Pre-Algebra, we use Learning Language Arts Through Lit, and<br/>
then for Science and History we use Sonlight books and just read a lot<br/>
and do narrations. Sometimmes the Science will have a few questions. <br/>
We have also done a few lapbooks. But see ALL of this is planned out<br/>
by me, and then he does it and checks it off.(that is his choice- he<br/>
is a big box checker) And then when he gets done he has a few<br/>
chores(feeds animals, takes out trash, sometimes cleans kitchen and<br/>
sometimes vacumms-they are kinda of sporadic though) And then he has<br/>
game time. But we were limiting his game time to 2 hours during the<br/>
week and unlimited on the weekends.  <br/>
<br/>
All of this to say- I don&#39;t even know where to begin with him. If I<br/>
let him go and say you can do whatever(or even tell him we are going<br/>
to try unschooling) he knows what it is we have friends who unschool.<br/>
I am so afraid to have a couch potato kid that would never come out to<br/>
the light of the day, and he would be brain dead from games.<br/>
<br/>
If you are still reading thank you all ANY help you might be able to<br/>
give.  I trully believe in unschooling- but I am afraid I am not able<br/>
to make it work. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again <br/>
Heather in Alabama</div>

    Hi I all. I am Heather momma to 4 kiddos. 12yos, 7yod, 5yod, and <br/>
4yod.<br/>
 We have homeschooled for 8 years now. We have ran the gammut I am<br/>
sure.  Text books, work books, living book, units you name it we have<br/>
tried it.  But several times my husband and I have gone back to &quot;Well<br/>

who is normally more controlling and wanting to get this done and that<br/>
done- say its ok do whatever you want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
SLOWLY---and by simply saying &quot;yes&quot; more and more.<br/>
<br/>
DON&#39;T say, &quot;It&#39;s OK. Do whatever you want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Start slowly by agreeing to more and more---S-L-O-W-L-Y!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am by no mean s rigid and sit down booky.  Espicially with my little<br/>
ones.  But I do have control to an extent<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Start letting control go.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   But I have 3 little ones and sometimes the wanting mommy is driving <br/>
me crazy already.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But you have three little ones. They won&#39;t be little for all that much <br/>
longer---they grow so fast. Enjoy the small amount of time you have <br/>
left. Seriously! I know it doesn&#39;t feel that way now, but they&#39;re NOT <br/>
little forever---no matter HOW it feels right now! Enjoy it while <br/>
you&#39;ve got it!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
 And if that is what we did all the<br/>
time(letting them decide what we do, when we do it) I could just go<br/>
wonky.  PLEASE someone if I am getting this wrong or if anyone has any<br/>
ideas for me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ask for more input from them. Agree to their input. Slowly.<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t go wonky. Small incremements. Take it easy. Do more. Let them <br/>
make decisions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have had this guilt complex though, that my 7yo is not reading yet.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
*You* feel guilty because your child&#39;s not reading yet? Guilty?<br/>
<br/>
Embarrassed?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She really wants to know how and just will not click. But if I am<br/>
undrestanding correctly, if I was trying to unschool I wouldn&#39;t worry<br/>
so much about it. And just help her when she wants, and read with her<br/>
and to her and it will naturally? Is this correct.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s surrounded by the witten word, she will learn to read. Do you <br/>
read to her? Do you answer her questions?<br/>
<br/>
How did she learn to talk?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
For my 13yos it is going to proove to be harder to let go for me. He<br/>
now does Pre-Algebra, we use Learning Language Arts Through Lit, and<br/>

and do narrations. Sometimmes the Science will have a few questions.<br/>

chores(feeds animals, takes out trash, sometimes cleans kitchen and<br/>
sometimes vacumms-they are kinda of sporadic though)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a lister too. I LIKE my lists. They&#39;re helpful to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  And then he has game time. But we were limiting his game time to 2 <br/>
hours during the<br/>
week and unlimited on the weekends.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And if you lift limits,he will probably game A LOT. Are you ready for <br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
All of this to say- I don&#39;t even know where to begin with him. If I<br/>
let him go and say you can do whatever(or even tell him we are going<br/>
to try unschooling) he knows what it is we have friends who unschool.<br/>
I am so afraid to have a couch potato kid that would never come out to<br/>
the light of the day, and he would be brain dead from games.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I sent that to Sandra for her &quot;If I let&quot; page.<br/>
<br/>
Is that REALLY what you are afraid of? He would never come out to the <br/>
light of day? That he would be brain dead? Really?<br/>
<br/>
The words we choose are very powerful. Does he know you feel this way? <br/>
I hope not.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t remove the limits all at once. Slowly start saying yes more. &quot;May <br/>
I play until I reach the next level?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;May I play another ten <br/>
minutes?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Another half-hour?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you are still reading thank you all ANY help you might be able to<br/>
give.  I trully believe in unschooling- but I am afraid I am not able<br/>
to make it work.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
If you believe you can or believe you can&#39;t, you&#39;re right.<br/>
<br/>
What do you really believe?<br/>

<br/>
Not Kelly, but I can explain this.<br/>
When you do a sudden shift and tell kids &quot;no more rules&quot; or some such<br/>
statement, it leaves them feeling confused and a bit lost. Rather than<br/>
making a sudden change that makes kids feel insecure, we recommend<br/>
simply saying &quot;yes&quot; more often, paying attention to your interactions,<br/>
trying to be more mindful rather than reactiionary.<br/>
<br/>
Lifting everything at once can lead to some major chaos, and that&#39;s<br/>
certainly not a great environment for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Kids will notice the changes, even when you don&#39;t make some broad<br/>
sweeping change. And then you get the chance to explain why you feel<br/>
differently about some of the things you aren&#39;t saying &quot;no&quot; about as<br/>
often.<br/>

    Kelly,  Er...I did lift nearly all the limits at once.  Why did you <br/>

<br/>
Because it can be suddenly overwhelming. THings may come back and bite <br/>
you in the butt. You may feel as if all of you are drowning because <br/>
there&#39;re no safety wings or boogie boards to cling to. You&#39;re all <br/>
floudering in the deep end without tools. Like you didn&#39;t master <br/>
treading water while you were in the baby pool. The kids may feel at a <br/>
loss because &quot;mom said &#39;no rules&#39;:&quot; so it was OK to dive off the high <br/>
dive.<br/>
<br/>
Many families end up clinging HARD to the sides of the pool and decide <br/>
they will NEVER try that again! *We* were obviously crazy to suggest <br/>
such a dangerous activity.<br/>
<br/>
Works differently for each family, of course. And the fewer rules a <br/>
family had to start with will have fewer problems   The fewer mandatory <br/>
chores a family had, the more floaties and noodles your children might <br/>
toss to you if they see you&#39;re struggling<br/>
<br/>
The more overall issues you&#39;ve been dealing with (just out of school, <br/>
authoritarian/controlling parenting/serious chores and homework issues/ <br/>
strict bedtimes and food restrictions and heavy limits on TV, computers <br/>
and gaming), the more you might need a Newfoundland dog which could <br/>
rescue all the drowning souls! &lt;G&gt;  &#39;Cause *everyone* is in over his <br/>
head!<br/>
<br/>
Having *YES* floaties and water wings and noodles and life-rings <br/>
floating around the pool gives them more opportunities to cling to what <br/>
they&#39;re most comfortable wit<br/>
<br/>
Just saying yes more will make the transition smoother. Keep you saner. <br/>
