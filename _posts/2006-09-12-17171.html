If what you want is more important than what your child wants, then<br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t going to work for you. What NY wants is neither here<br/>
nor there. I know plenty of unschoolers that follow the law just fine,<br/>
yet allow their children the freedom to learn what they want.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re doing is shutting off the joy of learning. We&#39;re here to<br/>
tell you that any coercion is detrimental to the learning process. You<br/>
can choose to take a permanent vacation today. You can choose<br/>
unschooling and joy in learning that doesn&#39;t get squelched. Please<br/>
spend some time to read our links section for tons of great reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-890163824">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We are still new to this (last week was our first week of <br/>
unschooling), but we spent last week doing some gardening/yard work, <br/>
went garage saling, watched movies, and played some games.  We&#39;ve <br/>
tried to keep busy doing things that they like.  We were also able to <br/>
meet their dad for a picnic during his lunch break from work.<br/>
<br/>
This week, we&#39;ve not done alot, so far, because the weather has been <br/>
rainy, but we were able to go for a walk through the neighborhood, and <br/>
look at how many houses were just like ours, and how many were for <br/>
sale.  Yesterday, I played a video game with my daughter, and she did <br/>
some basic math in it, while my son went back to bed and slept for a <br/>
while.  Because we are still new to this, we are doing what is called <br/>
deschooling-which I&#39;ve been told is a month for every year they were <br/>
in school.  Mine just were pulled out of school at the end of the last <br/>
school year-3rd and 4th grade, so I am taking the time to reconnect <br/>
with my kids, and find out what their interests are, and the things <br/>
that they like.  It&#39;s a whole new world with lots more freedom than <br/>
they have ever had in public schools.  We have gone exploring into <br/>
different store, and will hopefully go into a couple of businesses <br/>
this week, that we&#39;ve never been before.  Life has changed for the <br/>
better, and we are truly enjoying ourselves for the first time in a <br/>
very long time.  We chose unschooling, because it lets the kids learn <br/>
about the things they like, and it fits our lifestyle better.  I guess <br/>
I haven&#39;t really told you much, but if you look into some Sandra Dodd <br/>
websites, they are loaded with alot of information, and also a local <br/>
library should have some books too.  I hope this helps some--good luck <br/>
on your decision- I just knew that it wouldn&#39;t be good to make my kids <br/>
sit at a table, and make them do work, after they have been doing that <br/>
at public schools.  It would be no different from what I just took <br/>
them out of.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why do you want them to learn what &quot;NY wants&quot;? How can you be sure <br/>
of &quot;what they really need to know&quot;? Unschooling is about removing the <br/>
locus of control from an external source (the state, the parents) and <br/>
putting it back where it really belongs, within the learner. It is <br/>
possible to unschool and satisfy the state legalities (cause I know <br/>
there are unschoolers in NY) without requiring the kids to do x or y <br/>
or z a certain way at a certain time. Rather, it&#39;s about framing what <br/>
they are doing of their own accord in a manner that is what the state <br/>
looks for just to keep the state happy and out of your hair. That&#39;s <br/>
your part of the situation - keeping track of stuff and wordsmithing <br/>
things so that the state is happy and interferes minimally with your <br/>
kids&#39; lives. And, too, your role is to facilitate their interests, not <br/>
direct them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is living and learning without a prepared curriculum. It&#39;s the learning that happens when our minds are engaged and interested. It&#39;s also the learning that happens when we&#39;re daydreaming and pensive. Think of a fun and interesting day of summer vacation. That&#39;s unschooling. Think of a rainy weekend at home watching TV and baking cookies with the kids. That&#39;s unschooling. Think about bringing the world to your children and then happily assisting them as they explore, investigate, gaze, ponder and learn. That&#39;s unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else recommeded Sandra&#39;s website and I do too. You can find it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a> It&#39;s the most comprehensive site on unschooling out there. She&#39;s got a page just devoted to typical day stories here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>

<br/>
How old are your kids? How long have you been homeschooling? With unschooling we&#39;ve found that the &quot;standards&quot; set by the state are limiting rather than helpful. My kids learn what they really need to know, when they really need to know it. No boring seat work here! :o)<br/>
