<div id="ygrps-yiv-945236674">Hi Sharon! <br/>
 <br/>
I could have posted this myself, at least the first paragraph. I have four  <br/>
children. My second born just turned seven. He has the exact same issue. He is  <br/>
too busy to pee so he waits and waits and waits until he can&#39;t hold it <br/>
anymore  and then he either doesn&#39;t tell anyone (so he can keep playing) or is <br/>
standing  or sitting in a puddle. For us I know that he has no physical issue with <br/>
it  because he never does it when we are not at home and he has never wet the <br/>
bed at  night. <br/>
 <br/>
My son finally seems to be over the hump with his accidents. I offered him  a <br/>
portable toilet a few months ago as a way of brainstorming his problem. (&quot;I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to stop playing to go potty&quot;. &quot;Okay, what are somethings we can do  <br/>
that can help you not stop playing?&quot;) He seemed pretty thrilled with that <br/>
idea  until we looked at the pictures online and he realized they were for <br/>
babies. At  that point I think a light went off in his head and he realized he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want  to do that anymore. <br/>
 <br/>
Your son (and my son!) needs to realize that whatever fun they are  having is <br/>
not going to end because they took a two minute break to go to the  bathroom. <br/>
We have acted this out by &quot;freezing&quot; while he ran to the bathroom,  pausing <br/>
video games, putting a bookmark in a book or even following him to  the <br/>
bathroom so he would know we weren&#39;t playing without him. <br/>
 <br/>
Since we have the same problem I am not sure how helpful I can be but I  <br/>
definitely wanted to offer my support. I am fairly certain this is the first  time <br/>
I have posted here. I really appreciate all of the stories and advice I  read <br/>
here. All of you make me a better Mom. :-) <br/>
 <br/>
I also wanted to add that I have explained to him in detail why his  <br/>
accidents take more time to clean up than they would take if he just used the  toilet <br/>
but I have never had him clean up his own pee. I think that&#39;s cruel. I  <br/>
understand the logic but it does not work for me or my son. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s pretty common.  I don&#39;t wet myself but I often get intensely busy and<br/>
make a quick dash to the toilet myself.  Sometimes I could probably break my<br/>
leg or my neck getting there-- I have to go that bad.  Kids just don&#39;t care<br/>
as much.  It can be annoying to frequently clean pants but I do this for<br/>
Karl because I know he understands where to go (not in his pants) but since<br/>
I&#39;m the one who wants clean pants that are worn on his bottom, I choose to<br/>
let it go because I really don&#39;t have control over what goes on in there.<br/>
<br/>
I have also asked him<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if there is anything I can do to help him with this and he has gotten<br/>
&gt; angry and pushed me away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How are you supposed to help him do something that&#39;s not important to him<br/>
yet?<br/>
<br/>
He does have days when he stay dry all day<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and uses the potty regularly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Doesn&#39;t sound to me like a health problem.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Testing and medication is what doctors do.  Other than relying on patient<br/>
feedback to make a diagnosis, what else do you expect them to do in order to<br/>
determine if there&#39;s a health problem?  If you get unsolicited advice about<br/>
parenting, just ignore it.  But you *are* soliciting for medical advice and<br/>
you may get advice that you don&#39;t want.  That&#39;s always a risk when you go<br/>
see a doctor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342445439">What was helpful for us was occasional (every few hours) reminders to DS<br/>
*during commercials* or other natural breaks in the action - before<br/>
leaving the house or wherever we might be (when I always do a pit stop<br/>
anyhow for myself), when changing from one toy or game to another, and<br/>
so on. His dilemma was that he didn&#39;t want to stop what he was doing but<br/>
he also didn&#39;t like the feeling of sogginess (and no that&#39;s not where my<br/>
screen name came from). So, we helped him to find a way out - reminders<br/>
about potty breaks during naturally occurring breaks. By going a little<br/>
bit quickly during the commercial, he had less urgency when the next<br/>
activity was happening. Didn&#39;t take long for it to become a habit for<br/>
him to use commercials, end of program, end of movie/DVD, end of game<br/>
(or end of his turn in a multi player game), etc for a quick run to the<br/>
bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
It will come in time - DS was still having soggy incidents at 5. By 7,<br/>
they were gone. Now he&#39;s 10 and unless he&#39;s ill, there are no soggy<br/>
issues. Oh, also, we do remind him, during warmer months especially,<br/>
about staying hydrated so he&#39;ll sometimes stop to get a drink of water<br/>
and go potty at the same time then off again - like an Indy pit stop,<br/>
get it all done in one stop so he can keep playing for a long stretch.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-321636614">Hi,<br/>
my oldest will be turning 7 in a week, and he has had that problem until very recently. He would just wait so long to go and pee until sometimes it was just too late. For a while it happened almost once a day that he was just a little too late on his way to the bathroom. It has only happened in public once and that was when he had just turned six and he was taking a class and did not find the bathroom in time. I never thought there was a real problem with it, just that he gets very involved in his playing and the more excitement there is the less he would want to stop what he was doing. I still have to follow him to the bathroom to this day as he likes to talk or have someone there. What helped is to remind him friendly when I see he has to go - we have a little joke about the pee dance - and also to reassure him that we can pause the video or that I will guard his legos from his little brother while he goes to the bathroom, and that we can keep playing<br/>
 right where we left of. A little friend he had, also six, did the same thing once when he was over and my son reassured him it has happened to him too. <br/>
Thinking of it now makes me realize this thing has not happened for at least a month or two now. Sometimes I would wonder about it especially since I have another boy who just turned four and who had been completely dry since he was barely two. Since I did the Diaper free baby with him from when he was born it made him so much more aware of his bodily functions, I wish I had known about it with my older one. <br/>
I never did mention this to the pediatrician, and I suggest if you do, to either ask him first if it is o.k. or do it privately. I remember that it seemed worse if I was getting anxious about it. Not making a big deal of it, friendly reminders and time worked best for us. Don&#39;t know if this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824355759">My son just turned eight and it happens less frequently these days but <br/>
yes it has still happened. VibraLite puts out several watches that have <br/>
vibrating timers. You can find them in medical stores, incontinence <br/>
sites and deaf sites. The VibraLite3 has a repeating timer (meaning that <br/>
you can set it and it will go off and then repeat - we set it for every <br/>
two hours - especially when we are in a situation where he will get more <br/>
distracted then usual - like outings and family events. If it is a <br/>
younger child 4,5,6 I would suggest the parent to wear the watch and <br/>
then say remind them quietly to go try. There is also a potty monkey <br/>
that can help your child remember. It should be easy to find online.<br/>

This Friday, my son has his annual well child visit to the doctor. I<br/>
want to inform her (this year it is a different doctor in the same<br/>
practice) about it, to be sure it is still not a health issue.<br/>
I want some RU support so that I can feel that I have alternatives in<br/>
case I get some more unsolicited advice or they talk about the use of<br/>
medication or testing (this may or may not come up).<br/>
