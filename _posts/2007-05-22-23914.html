kids, I need an understanding of coginitive<br/>
development. If I&#39;m living with my kid, I know what<br/>
she&#39;s ready for by observing her and being with her.<br/>
If I introduce something to her and she&#39;s not ready<br/>
for it, I can change course right away. I think it<br/>
shows a lack of understanding of unschooling to say<br/>
that we assume they&#39;re more ready than they are. FWIW<br/>
nobody in my family watches the news because we<br/>
(including the grown ups) are not ready for it :-)<br/>
<br/>
My unschooling philosophy is based on how I learn, how<br/>
I&#39;ve seen other people of all ages learn. It comes<br/>
from the belief that true learning comes from being<br/>
interested in something.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt whom I consider the patron saint of<br/>
unschooling spent a lot of time with children<br/>
observing how they learnt (or did not) He has written<br/>
excellent books on the subject.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-257530226">~~. She explained to me that  <br/>
unfortunately unschooling isn&#39;t based on any understanding of a  <br/>
child&#39;s cognitive development. ~~<br/>
<br/>
Bull!<br/>
That just proves she knows NOTHING of the unschooling philosophy<br/>
whatsover. Anyone who reads Holt realizes very quickly that its<br/>
completely in line with cognitive develpment theories. Schooling isn&#39;t<br/>
in line with those theories, which is why it shocks me that people<br/>
getting an education degree don&#39;t see that! .<br/>
<br/>
As far as I&#39;m concerned, Piaget&#39;s theories have held up pretty well,<br/>
but Steiner has some really nutty, cultish ideas. Anyone that wants to<br/>
understand cognitive development is better off reading Piaget!<br/>
<br/>
Where does the idea that children shouldn&#39;t use black in their artwork<br/>
come from? That&#39;s a Steiner thing and has nothing to do with cognitive<br/>
development. I find Waldorf another form of coercion, that just looks<br/>
prettier from the outside.<br/>
<br/>
Understanding child development can really help people get to gentle<br/>
parenting (seeing that a two year old has little concept of<br/>
right/wrong might cause more parents to not make a 2y.o. clean up a<br/>
mess they created), but the greatest factor with unschooling is<br/>
trusting the needs and desires of the child right in front of you. One<br/>
doesn&#39;t need a host of &quot;methods&quot; to simply trust their child and help<br/>
them get what they need and want.<br/>
<br/>
Any method that encourages a child to dress a certain way, use certain<br/>
materials over others, certain colors over others, bans electronic<br/>
media for the most part, encourages certain foods over others etc...is<br/>
total manipulation. Not only are Waldorf children being manipulated,<br/>
the parents are too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853152914">Did your friend or the book happen to mention that Steiner was a white supremacist?  <br/>
   <br/>
  IMO, he wasn&#39;t a nice guy and for me this colors all my perceptions of his philosophies.  <br/>
   <br/>
  The whole theory that children aren&#39;t &#39;complete&#39; until age 8 or so bothers me, too.  That&#39;s behind the practice of limiting not only electronic media, but also what learning kids should be given when.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I knew one Waldorf homeschooling Mom who was worried becuase her 3rd child had &#39;learned some letters sooner than she should have&#39;  making it harder to teach her in the right way.  Learning letters in the wrong order?!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Way too much control over parents by the curriculum being exercised there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s important to add, too, that Steiner died in 1925, before<br/>
electronic media was even available, let alone in wide use. <br/>
Therefore, the Waldorfian position on electronic media is really more<br/>
dogmatic; Steiner never really got to weigh in on such things.  It&#39;s<br/>
also important to note that Steiner&#39;s theories and concepts stopped<br/>
evolving when he did.  So, folks who adhere strictly to Waldorf dogma<br/>
are making life choices based on a 19th- to early 20th-century,<br/>
industrial-age modality that has not had a chance to evolve.  A lot of<br/>
water has passed under the bridge since then!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527864860">Steiner education is the &quot;mainstream&quot; alternative choice here in  <br/>
Australia. That is to say most parents who question mainstream  <br/>
education end up committing to Steiner schools, many of which are  <br/>
public (government funded).<br/>
<br/>
We were heavily drawn to aspects of Steiner as new parents... it  <br/>
seemed peaceful, in touch with nature, healthy and so on. I was put  <br/>
off by the philosophy behind Steiner (Anthroposophy) but could ignore  <br/>
it because i enjoyed aspects of its practice. It was really our  <br/>
daughter who rejected it though, by the time she was four... thus  <br/>
began our unschooling adventure. We have many Steiner friends and our  <br/>
unschooling path was a very rude shock to many of them.<br/>
<br/>
Motivated by this, I wrote an Article about unschooling that is  <br/>
getting published next week in the a magazine called Kindred  <br/>
(formerly Byrons Child) which is Australia&#39;s main alternative  <br/>
parenting magazine. The article is pitched squarely at Steiner bods  <br/>
as they make up the mags main readership and as i say, most of the  <br/>
alternative thinking parents in Australia...<br/>
