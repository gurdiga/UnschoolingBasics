Is there  anyone who lives in SC who has any advice for me as far as the laws <br/>
go?   I looked over the laws and it looks like option #3 would be the best <br/>
one  (because you don&#39;t have to deal with the public schools) but I was hoping  <br/>
somebody could give me some real life experience with SC law and  unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>

Hi Kim, I&#39;m not sure if anyone responded yet because my email inbox is a  <br/>
mess!  So at the risk of being redundant....<br/>
 <br/>
yes, Option 3 is the way to go.   I can give you more info, maybe  off-list?<br/>
 <br/>
We moved here from Jacksonville, NC last year and are a military  family.  We <br/>
are in Beaufort, where are you going to be?  <br/>
 <br/>
Kelly (one of this list&#39;s moderators) also has the schoolsoutsupport yahoo  <br/>
group that is a state-wide unschoolers&#39; list.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck with your move....I am still not completely unpacked!   Ack!<br/>
