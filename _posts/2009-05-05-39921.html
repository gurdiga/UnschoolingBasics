<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670591738">I have a friend who is going to begin homeschooling next school year that lives in Charleston... she probably isn&#39;t going to be an unschooler but still is a bit confused about the options given to HS&#39;ers in the state that give her the most freedom from the government...  I would appreciate being able to ask a few questions on her behalf of someone that is in the &quot;know&quot; for the state!   You can reply privately so as to not clog the list with non unschooling discussion!   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!!  <br/>
