<div id="ygrps-yiv-174030944">This link was sent to me today, thought I&#39;d share it:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/freecyclehomeschool/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/freecyclehomeschool/</a><br/>
<br/>
The group just got started and what I mainly saw was curriculum.  <br/>
Since it is free stuff (except for shipping) I think it might be worth <br/>
checking out from time to time.<br/>
