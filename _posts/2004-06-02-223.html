Just wondering...what do you think she might do? Jaiden and Avery are (2.5 and 5.5) and they are fine to be any room.<br/>

I worry that if I were to lay down and sleep in my bedroom, that she <br/>
might decide to get creative, look for something, etc. and have an <br/>
accident of some sort, somehow.  I am really afraid that if she hurt <br/>
herself accidentally, and needed t go to the hospital, that I might <br/>
face Children&#39;s Services for being negligent (sleeping on the job).  <br/>
I know of too many people who have had a house call from CS for <br/>
ridiculous reasons -- and have heard about others who are <br/>
neglecting/abusing their children, and somehow have never had a <br/>
visit, or CS came and saw no problem.  I do not live in fear or hover <br/>
over their daily activities, because I do feel comfortable with our <br/>
home environment as being child friendly.  I allow them to do their <br/>
own thing in the house or yard without worry most of the time, but <br/>
cannot relax enough to take a nap in another room.  I feel like I am <br/>
really stretching safety to occasionally take a shower and leave them <br/>
alone.  Because you never know what can happen in life...accidents <br/>
are accidents.  I don&#39;t see this as a trust issue.<br/>
