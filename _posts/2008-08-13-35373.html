<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879861037">We are just starting to deschool after homeschooling for about 2 years. <br/>
We are also an unusual family, in that I didn&#39;t join until the youngest <br/>
was almost 3yo. She immediately bonded with me (even with her mentally <br/>
ill mother still living with the family) but there were issues with how <br/>
the birth mother was handling bed time, especially for the youngest. She <br/>
would single her out and put her to bed early (pretty much everything <br/>
the toddler did annoyed her) at the other end of the house in her <br/>
&quot;sister&#39;s bed&quot;. The sister was sleeping with grandma until I came along <br/>
and needed the spot: then the older dd slept in the lower bunk in the <br/>
kids room and the youngest slept in the living room with the mother. <br/>
When either girl was scared in the night they walked by their mother and <br/>
came to grandma and me (the youngest actually had to walk around her <br/>
mother to come to our door).<br/>
<br/>
When we moved out with the kids, the girls were 4 and 6. They slept in <br/>
their own room in bunk beds although it took some convincing to get the <br/>
youngest to sleep in her own bed (we weren&#39;t unschooling and had never <br/>
heard of attachment parenting at that time--we just wanted our privacy <br/>
and to not be elbowed in the night!). The youngest was never really <br/>
happy sleeping alone and when we rearranged the house so the girls each <br/>
had their own room they started sleeping together in one bed. This has <br/>
continued to our most recent move, where they again have their own rooms <br/>
and the dd11 doesn&#39;t want to sleep with her younger sister anymore, SO <br/>
the 9yo dd has recently returned to our bed.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a lot going on in her life at the moment that&#39;s upsetting <br/>
her. Her birth mother has decided she wants her kids to live with her <br/>
even though they have lived with my partner their whole lives and we <br/>
have had sole physical and legal custody for the past five years. This <br/>
is deeply upsetting them. This is especially hitting the youngest <br/>
hard--she doesn&#39;t even remember living with her mom.<br/>
<br/>
I have accepted her need and desire to have family to sleep with and am<br/>
content with that, but my partner is less committed and would kind of <br/>
like to have the bed to ourselves (especially for couple time). I&#39;m <br/>
hoping that dd9 is just needing the comfort and reassurance of the <br/>
family bed at least partly because she was forced out before she was <br/>
ready earlier but has anyone had a similar experience of an older child <br/>
sleeping with parents? I realize writing this that I am more goal <br/>
oriented than I realized--I say &quot;family bed&quot; but I still think &quot;our bed&quot; <br/>
and want to know what to do to &quot;get her out of it.&quot; Yuck! I need to see <br/>
this in a new light somehow.<br/>
<br/>
I did have the feeling a few months ago of realizing that even the <br/>
youngest would be &quot;too old&quot; (my thought at the time) to want to sleep <br/>
with us soon and I cherished her sleeping with us but that feeling has <br/>
been hard to sustain.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any thoughts others had that might help me understand <br/>
the family bed concept and how my partner and I could be more <br/>
comfortable sharing our bed with our growing daughter. The web sites I <br/>
found on the family bed all talk about toddlers (which I regret I didn&#39;t <br/>
read when the kids were younger!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the biggest help will be a shift in perspective from night  <br/>
time being couple time. It&#39;s certainly *convenient* then but it&#39;s not  <br/>
the only time it can happy. It&#39;s funny but when I first started  <br/>
reading about the family bed most of the posts were from couples with  <br/>
large families. They were obviously finding *plenty* of time for  <br/>
snuggling outside of night time! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
A question to ask, to put it in perspective, is &quot;Is your grandchild&#39;s  <br/>
fear and discomfort a worthy trade for the convenience of couple time  <br/>
at night?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was with us until she was 14, I think. And the reason she  <br/>
moved out at that age was to be with the ferrets that moved into her  <br/>
room. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
(Which, combined with her problems sleeping over at friends&#39; houses,  <br/>
would certainly sound alarm bells in most conventional parents that  <br/>
she&#39;d never be independent. Yet the next summer she flew halfway  <br/>
across the US for a 2 week car design camp at a college in Detroit  <br/>
and never had a moment&#39;s homesickness.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-487370687">I don&#39;t personally have experience to relate, but I have the example of<br/>
friends of ours.  Their daughter slept with them until she was 11.  As she<br/>
had from birth.  My impression of her then (14 years old) was a very<br/>
self-determined confident child and now she&#39;s about 21 or 22.  I didn&#39;t know<br/>
until she was 14 that they had ever co-slept.<br/>
<br/>
The family bed is a microcosm representing all of a child&#39;s life.  First<br/>
they leave the family bed, then the family home, sometimes the hometown, or<br/>
even the country.  Similarly, a child learns to walk, to run, to ride a<br/>
bike, scooter, skateboard and so on, to drive and travel off.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing to be in a hurry about.<br/>
<br/>
With the attachment parenting/ unschooling thought, the basic idea is to be<br/>
available all through a child&#39;s life so that the child can venture out from<br/>
a secure base.  If parents make the decision when a child is to venture out,<br/>
then the child will be insecure and will cling more desperately.  If child<br/>
makes the decision when to venture out, the child will feel welcome and at<br/>
home, and will be able move on, sometimes (maybe frequently ;) before<br/>
parents are ready.<br/>
<br/>
From what you have written it sounds to me like living with her mother is<br/>
scary.  You are who she knows and trusts but if you push her out, she will<br/>
likely think that she can can&#39;t trust you, that you&#39;re not supportive of<br/>
her, that you don&#39;t want her.<br/>
<br/>
Her birth mother has decided she wants her kids to live with her<br/>
even though they have lived with my partner their whole lives and we<br/>
have had sole physical and legal custody for the past five years.<br/>
<br/>
Questions to ponder for yourself, and not anything I want answers for:  Is<br/>
the mother&#39;s decision about seeking custody?  How much leeway do you have to<br/>
support the child&#39;s decision in all this?  How about visiting rather than<br/>
suddenly moving a child at the age of 9 to a mother she has little or no<br/>
recollection of?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336200307">Hi Robin<br/>
My daughter slept with me on and off until she was 11 or 12.  Most of <br/>
the time it was just the two of us so couple time wasn&#39;t really an <br/>
issue.  If I had a partner at the time coupling was done at his house <br/>
or when she wasn&#39;t home.  We did have a 2 year period that I lived <br/>
with boyfriend.  Most of that time her bed was in our room because his <br/>
son also moved in with us.  SHe was 5-7yo during that time.  It was <br/>
good arrangement for us because she was close enough to me to feel <br/>
comfortable and if she needed to she could crawl in for a cuddle then <br/>
would go back to her bed.  Maybe that would work for you if you <br/>
granddaughter was ok with it.<br/>
