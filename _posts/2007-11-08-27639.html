<div id="ygrps-yiv-600216939">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
My dd has expressed to me that she would like to &quot;do school&quot; again. We<br/>
have been deschooling since April of this year, homeschooling for 3<br/>
1/2 years. She said she feels she is being lazy.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on how to approach this? I would like for this to be<br/>
her choice and remain as unschooling as possible. I don&#39;t want to go<br/>
back to purchasing a set curriculum and plodding along with me saying<br/>
do this and that. She hasn&#39;t expressed any interests in outside<br/>
classes or workshops. We haven&#39;t had much luck with any we have tried<br/>
in the past.<br/>
<br/>
I told her to think about what &quot;doing school&quot; means to her. She really<br/>
only knows about school at home and public school. We do not have any<br/>
unschooling friends. I told her she was really in charge of what she<br/>
learns. I was just here to guide her and help her get what she needs.<br/>
She said that it was kind of scary knowing she was in charge of her<br/>
education.<br/>
<br/>
I need some guidance from all you experienced unschoolers. Any input<br/>
would be greatly appreciated!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-486042552"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;At 14:32 11/8/2007, you wrote:<br/>
&gt;  I told her she was really in charge of what she<br/>
&gt;learns. I was just here to guide her and help her get what she needs.<br/>
&gt;She said that it was kind of scary knowing she was in charge of her<br/>
&gt;education.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Eeek!!!  I can see what her concern is.  She&#39;s 13 years old and has <br/>
always been a passenger in the vehicle, and now all of a sudden <br/>
you&#39;re telling her that *she&#39;s* driving the car!!!  Whoa!!!!!  That&#39;s <br/>
scary!  I&#39;d want to pull over and get out just as fast as possible, too!<br/>
<br/>
It may be as simple as you being more proactive and involved in her <br/>
unschooling life.  What is she interested in?  What does she <br/>
like?  Doesn&#39;t have to be classes or workshops.  It could be <br/>
*any*thing, knitting, making spitballs, hiking, anything at <br/>
all.  But, be with her as she fully explores her passions *with* you, <br/>
not with you just standing by in case she needs you.  If she feels <br/>
she&#39;s not in charge so much but more partners with you, that may be <br/>
more reassuring to her.<br/>
<br/>
In our society, kids hear way too much &quot;get an education&quot; propaganda, <br/>
and it affects them!  If she thinks she responsible for her own <br/>
education and she screws it up, that&#39;s too much intense <br/>
responsibility.  If you can shoulder some of that for her, she can <br/>
get back to the business of living her life, knowing *you&#39;re* in <br/>
charge, not her.<br/>
<br/>
Also, since you don&#39;t have unschoolers in your life, gather lots of <br/>
anecdotes for her of other unschoolers who are doing well and living <br/>
their lives successfully and strew that information for her (in other <br/>
words, don&#39;t ram it down her throat, just make the information <br/>
available to her).<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps a little!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>She has been keeping busy reading books, drawing, learning web design<br/>
and computer illustration. She knows what her passions are. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think, or know, she is still getting used to the idea that you do<br/>
not have to use an Algebra book to learn Algebra. You can if you want.<br/>
I have shouldered it all of it for her the last 3 years and she didn&#39;t<br/>
like it. She needs to feel in control and not pushed. That is why we<br/>
went the unschooling route. I don&#39;t believe the &quot;in charge&quot; part is<br/>
scaring her. She just doesn&#39;t know any other way besides me telling<br/>
her this is what you should learn. That is where I need some guidance.<br/>
How do I guide her? <br/>
<br/>
We talked a little more tonight about what she was feeling. She said<br/>
she feels like she should be doing something. I told her that reading,<br/>
drawing, teaching herself to create web pages and draw on the computer<br/>
are doing something. I think some of this is coming from her school<br/>
friends who are talking to her about their school work. She has<br/>
brought it up a couple times that they have a writing assignment or<br/>
Biology homework. <br/>
<br/>
Does anybody have any suggestions? I think she has reached a<br/>
transition period in her unschooling and needs to know what to do. I<br/>
am not sure what that is.<br/>

Handbook&quot; - I&#39;m thinking of the last half of the book which is all  <br/>
filled with ideas of ways to learn all kinds of things.<br/>
