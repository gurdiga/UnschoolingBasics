an in-person interview would be like, with you and your soon-to-be college <br/>

don&#39;t believe any of the schools he applied to require that.  The<br/>
other two -- CalTech and Harvey Mudd -- are reach schools, and I don&#39;t<br/>
expect him to get in.  No matter, either way, he needs fin. aid, so<br/>
hopefully some of that will come through, or I will keep losing sleep!)<br/>
<br/>
Still, the foreign language requirement is being met, without too much<br/>
fuss and bother.  He&#39;s almost done with the equivalent of first<br/>
semester, and will probably find the pace of the second semester, at<br/>
the college, rather leisurely compared to that!<br/>
<br/>
His test scores are pretty good -- but very blatantly show his area of<br/>
interest and his weak area.  (Weak was writing -- not bad, but 630<br/>
isn&#39;t in the 700&#39;s like his other scores.)  He has always been a<br/>
math/sciencey kind of kid, likes to read math-puzzle books for fun...<br/>
and thought he wasn&#39;t good at writing.  (He actually is, just<br/>
unpracticed.  His zany sense of humor often shows through when he writes.)<br/>
<br/>
Life is such an interesting journey, isn&#39;t it?  We never know what is<br/>
around the corner...<br/>

Woke up in the middle of the night thinking about all this!  We&#39;re  right in <br/>
the middle of it here.  Applications have been sent out to 5  schools that <br/>
Brenna is considering and so far she has heard from her top  two choices that she <br/>
has been accepted. Both have offered  scholarships which has been <br/>
encouraging.  We used a combination of  narrative and traditional type transcripts from <br/>
community college classes as  well as a letter I wrote detailing some her <br/>
experiences that past few  years.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re in Florida and she qualifies for some good scholarships based on  SAT&#39;s <br/>
and transcripts from community college classes.  She&#39;s spending some  time <br/>
each day searching for and applying for other scholarships.  Last  night, we <br/>
were laughing as she was reading about and applying for some kind of a  <br/>
scholarship related to Fire Sprinkler Systems!  &lt;g&gt;   I  guess we&#39;ll see if it really <br/>
is true that there is money out there if you just  apply for it.  She just <br/>
found out that she will receive a scholarship for  her involvement with Odyssey of <br/>
the Mind for several years.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m working on financial aid applications today so I&#39;m sure that had  <br/>
something to do with the middle of the night anxiety.<br/>
 <br/>
Our favorite resource during this process has been Alison McKee&#39;s book  &quot;From <br/>
Homeschool to College and Work&quot;.   Also, the book, Colleges That  Change <br/>
Lives&quot; helped us to find her first choice college which is<br/>
New College in Florida.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s an exciting time....many mixed emotions but overall it&#39;s been so  <br/>
positive and unschooling has not seemed in any way to have kept her  from being <br/>
accepted to the colleges she may attend. I think it has been positive  overall <br/>
because she does stand out from the typical college applicant and they  may have <br/>
looked more closely at some of our documentation.  None of the  colleges have <br/>
required an interview, although New College requested one.   It was a bit far <br/>
to drive (5 hours) and she prefers not to talk on the  phone.  We let them <br/>
know that we would drive to interview but they  said it wasn&#39;t necessary.<br/>

application process.  And since he also applied to their Honors<br/>
College, there was another essay for that.  Lots of opportunities to<br/>

Come to think of it, an interview might be detrimental.  He looks<br/>

community college from 16 to 18.  Unfortunately, we don&#39;t even HAVE a<br/>
cc, much less free (or even reduced rate) in Idaho.<br/>
<br/>
And the quality of the colleges in ID, well... if you look at the<br/>
average SAT scores (or ACT equivalents) here vs most other places, you<br/>
might figure out why we expanded the search outside of our state!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; were laughing as she was reading about and applying for some kind of a  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are a lot more available to your daughter, too, just because she<br/>
is a girl.  I just deleted all those that are only available to women<br/>
-- my son may be in touch with his feminine side, but he IS a boy!<br/>
<br/>
He DOES have one very small scholarship from when he was in a boy<br/>
scout troop selling popcorn -- he made enough in sales to qualify, so<br/>
even though his current troop doesn&#39;t do popcorn, he still has that<br/>
very tiny scholarship.<br/>

to encourage her ds to read it, but he is not sure what he wants to<br/>
do, and less than interested in researching colleges at the moment. <br/>
Wants to go, just not the legwork.  (Gotta be that pesky Y chromosome!)<br/>

Anyway, great to hear about your college news!<br/>
