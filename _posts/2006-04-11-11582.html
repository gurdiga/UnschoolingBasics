<div id="ygrps-yiv-105844368">&quot;If what you say is true, either the group description and name are <br/>
out of date, or your definition of this group as &#39;radical <br/>
unschooling&#39; is overstated and will tend to exclude people.  Anybody <br/>
care to weigh in here?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The list description says:  &quot;....become deeply familiar with natural<br/>
learning and how it affects our entire lives. From parenting issues to<br/>
learning from the whole wide world and beyond,....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling is the unschooling philosophy applied to all of<br/>
our lives. Exactly what the description is explaining. I don&#39;t need to<br/>
use some label of &quot;radical&quot; when the description says it&#39;s &quot;from<br/>
parenting issues to learning from the whole wide world...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This list is here to help folks understand how trusting our children<br/>
in ALL areas helps learning unfold better in your home and improves<br/>
relationships.<br/>
<br/>
A child learning about how their body feels and finding their own<br/>
balance with food (WITH a parent acting as their partner, not leaving<br/>
them on their own to figure it out), a child learning about household<br/>
tasks in their OWN time, a child listening to their own body&#39;s need<br/>
for sleep are all parts of LEARNING.<br/>
<br/>
To me, it is impossible to separate out different types of learning,<br/>
it&#39;s all LIFE. It is in the living that we learn. And to trust my<br/>
child to learn what they want, when they want in the way they want,<br/>
means to trust them in all areas.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t right there with them, pointing things out<br/>
when necessary, assisting them when they&#39;re young because their<br/>
developmental stage is more dependent.<br/>
I don&#39;t wait for Jalen to smack someone with a stick before I limit<br/>
his stick waving. There are some things I know they&#39;re too young to<br/>
learn just yet, so I assist. I trust that they will learn it in their<br/>
own time.....but I&#39;m here to keep them safe (and keep others safe) as<br/>
they learn these things. <br/>
<br/>
 My job is to creatively adapt the desire to the situation. My job is<br/>
to provide easy access to interesting materials, places, people and<br/>
things (within my child&#39;s comfort and interest range), my job is to<br/>
distract when necessary (useful for wee ones) and offer other options<br/>
when we hit a road block.  My job is to be kind and patient as these<br/>
small people try to make sense of their world and to assist them in<br/>
getting what they want and desire. My job is to get INTO their world,<br/>
understand what they love and BE with them.  A parent that is lovingly<br/>
connecting with their child is a parent that is facilitating learning.<br/>
