<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840709759">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to bother you guys again, but we had another issue about my <br/>
kids seeing their grandparents (dh&#39;s parents) this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
DH asked the kids if they wanted to do breakfast with his parents <br/>
this weekend.  DS said yes, only to make dh happy.  Dd didn&#39;t want <br/>
to, because she doesn&#39;t want to see them.<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday they woke up, and ate breakfast here.  Dh woke up really <br/>
grouchy, and was upset that they ate here, instead of wanting to go <br/>
out to breakfast with him and his parents.  (It was after 11:00 a.m. <br/>
when he left for breakfast.)  The kids are used to eating after they <br/>
get up, which has been around 9.  So to wait until 11 is too long for <br/>
them to eat after they get up.<br/>
<br/>
Problem remains, that my kids don&#39;t want to see their grandparents <br/>
here, and dh keeps trying to push them into it, even though he <br/>
promised he wouldn&#39;t.  My kids are attached to my parents, who live <br/>
550 miles away, and would rather see them.  How do we handle this, <br/>
and let dh know in a nice way, that he shouldn&#39;t push, and when the <br/>
kids are ready they will let him know?  I know it hurts him, but his <br/>
parents alienated my kids long ago, when they were out of the cute <br/>
baby stages.  They are now almost 10 and 11, and can make some of <br/>
those decisions on their own.  Dh never had a relationship with his <br/>
grandparents, so he understands, but never accepts that his parents <br/>
did this to themselves.   HELP?</div>

 </span></blockquote>First I need to say I am a grandma. My fourth grandaughter is due to <br/>
arrive next week. As much as you love your kids, you love your <br/>
grandkids and you do not have the same ability and access to your <br/>
grandchildren, especially if they are your sons children.I know that <br/>
sounds sexist, but truly it is not.<br/>
<br/>
Both of my dil are beautiful girls whom I completely love. They let <br/>
me love their children. They generously share them with me and love <br/>
me despite my faults.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest sons first wife did not like me. She hated me and after <br/>
she divorced my son she made it almost impossible to access my <br/>
grandaughter. It broke my heart. <br/>
<br/>
Some of my children are also adopted and we see there birth <br/>
families. As far as I can tell you cannot have to many people that <br/>
love you.<br/>
<br/>
My kids birthfamilies are not folks that I might choose to be <br/>
friends with if we did not share children. But they are my kids <br/>
birthfamilies and because I love my kids I make them comfortable and <br/>
I treat them with respect and kindness. They are my family. I also <br/>
set boundaries with the ones who are less appropriate so my kids <br/>
feel safe and can appreciate the contact. Like we meet in neutral <br/>
places and have timelines on the visit and code words so if they are <br/>
to uncomfortable we can leave. However during a visit I work very <br/>
hard to make sure my child and this birthfamily member are engaging <br/>
in positive interactions so my kids will feel good about the contact.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday former dil called and asked if I wanted to see <br/>
grandaughter.  She lives 21 hours away and it is a rarity to have <br/>
any access.I said I would love that. They spent six hours at my <br/>
house, former dil and grandaughter. I fed them, chatted and chose to <br/>
practice kindness and tolerance despite that fact that this girl <br/>
devistated my son and has done some very cruel things to my family, <br/>
includinng malicious untruths about me.<br/>
<br/>
She is the mother of my grandaughter, therefore she is also my <br/>
family. <br/>
<br/>
I know there are situation where family needs to have boundaries <br/>
set. Where hurts need to heal, but communication and kindness can <br/>
bridge many gaps.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry your family is split and hurting over this. It is really <br/>
sad for everyone.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can jump in on this one even though I&#39;m not the original poster! My  <br/>
older son doesn&#39;t much care to see my parents because my parents are  <br/>
not very affectionate. My father doesn&#39;t know how to give my older  <br/>
son Eric, who is six, time to warm up when we first arrive at their  <br/>
house, but immediately wants Eric to, say, hug, him. This has been  <br/>
the pattern since Eric was 2 or so:<br/>
<br/>
My dad: Give grandpa a hug!<br/>
<br/>
Eric stands quietly.<br/>
<br/>
My dad: Give me a hug!<br/>
<br/>
Eric scoots closer to me.<br/>
<br/>
My dad, yelling: ERIC! COME GIVE GRANDPA A HUG!<br/>
<br/>
Eric gets into my lap and stays there for an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Carl, 3, is much quicker to warm up, and has a more outgoing  <br/>
personality. In the last year, when we visit, my mother doesn&#39;t  <br/>
bother to hide her preference for Carl over Eric.<br/>
<br/>
My whole life, my parents treated me badly because I wasn&#39;t what they  <br/>
wanted in a daughter. Now they are increasingly indifferent to my  <br/>
kids, Eric especially, because he doesn&#39;t seem to fit some  <br/>
preconceived notion they have about what a grandson should be like.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of my parents is able to think of others, and put someone  <br/>
else&#39;s feelings ahead of their own. Not even small children&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t a kid want to see his grandparents? Because he&#39;s smart  <br/>
enough not to want to go where he is not valued and treated well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can be attached to 20 sets of grandparents, or you can have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; grandparents that you are not always thrilled with but you know love<br/>
&gt; you and are just who they are.It is not a contest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do you know they love you if they never treat you like they do? I  <br/>
recently read &quot;The Five Love Languages for Children&quot; because it was  <br/>
being discussed on AlwaysUnschooled. According to the authors, there  <br/>
are five &quot;love languages&quot;: gifts, acts of service, quality time,  <br/>
physical touch, and words of affirmation. Amazingly, my parents  <br/>
managed not to speak any of them, while maintaining a facade that we  <br/>
were a successful, happy family. I do suspect they love me, or think  <br/>
they do, but it is a lot to ask of a child that she &quot;know her  <br/>
grandparents love her&quot; and accept them for who they are when they are  <br/>
not showing love in any meaningful way and do not accept her for who  <br/>
she is. I am in my 40s and only just getting the hang of this with my  <br/>
parents, as I develop more compassion for them and their own  <br/>
childhoods--if you look at the families they came from, full of  <br/>
alcoholism and violence, my parents are miracles for not passing  <br/>
those dysfunctions on. But they still fell far short of giving me and  <br/>
my brother the love and affirmation children need to thrive, and, as  <br/>
grandparents, they are materially generous but cold and not  <br/>
affectionate.<br/>

<br/>
My in-laws live 5-10 minutes away from us.  We live in<br/>
the same town.<br/>
<br/>
My kids choose not to see their grandparents, because<br/>
as my son has told me many times--&quot;I have given them<br/>
lots of chances mom, and they have blown them all.&quot; <br/>
That is alot for an 11 year old boy to have to live<br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
We have made every opportunity for them to see the<br/>
kids, and they are not interested.  We invited them to<br/>
school stuff, when both kids were in ps, and I ended<br/>
up trying to explain that they couldn&#39;t come, when all<br/>
I knew was that they were either off to their other<br/>
grandson&#39;s concerts, which was after my childrens<br/>
concerts, or they just plain didn&#39;t want to go.  After<br/>
discussing this with my dh, we decided to stop<br/>
inviting them, because there was always an &quot;excuse&quot; to<br/>
why they couldn&#39;t come.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have also noticed that at family functions,<br/>
they are always paying attention to everyone else&#39;s<br/>
kids, but never them.  This hurts them, and they don&#39;t<br/>
understand why.  There are only 3 grandkids in dh&#39;s<br/>
family, two of them belong to us.  My son just told me<br/>
that he would rather not see his grandparents here,<br/>
because everytime a baby comes around, that doesn&#39;t<br/>
belong to the family, his grandparents treat him like<br/>
he doesn&#39;t exist, and just pays attention to the baby.<br/>
 They have always done this.<br/>
<br/>
I do make sure to tell them that their grandparents<br/>
love them, and I have no problem with my husband<br/>
taking them over there to visit, but plain and simple,<br/>
the kids just don&#39;t want to go.  I don&#39;t feel that<br/>
it&#39;s a good thing to force them, because it would do<br/>
more harm than good.  I also don&#39;t have a problem with<br/>
them being attached to both sets of grandparents. <br/>
There is no bond/connection with the set that lives<br/>
near us.<br/>
<br/>
My children are just as happy not to see them.  The<br/>
fact that they are attached to my parents is not a<br/>
contest.  It never was.  My parents do things with<br/>
them, call them long distance, send them letters, and<br/>
pictures.  The ones that live here, don&#39;t know my<br/>
kids, and have never taken the chance to get to know<br/>
them.  I have been put in situations with my dad&#39;s<br/>
parents, and was forced to go for visits with them. <br/>
It backfired and in a bad way.<br/>
<br/>
My children deserve to be happy, and feel loved and<br/>
safe.  They don&#39;t get those feelings from my in-laws. <br/>
I feel bad for my kids and my dh&#39;s parents, because<br/>
they are missing out on two really good kids.  I can<br/>
only get them to agree to see their grandparents once<br/>
a month at breakfast, if even that.  I can&#39;t help the<br/>
way their grandparents here treat them.  They are not<br/>
the traditional kind of grandparents, and don&#39;t really<br/>
have much time to spare to spend with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a nasty evil daughter in law.  I don&#39;t get<br/>
along with my in-laws, and they aren&#39;t allowed at my<br/>
house while I am home, but I have never stopped them<br/>
from seeing my kids.  They can call them any time they<br/>
want, but they choose not to.  They could ask for my<br/>
dh to take them over for a visit, but they don&#39;t. <br/>
None of this is my fault.  It is their&#39;s for not<br/>
making any effort to see their grandkids, and to get<br/>
to know them.  My kids have told me that when they<br/>
visit over there, their grandparents don&#39;t really talk<br/>
to them, and talk to my dh instead.  I guess sometimes<br/>
they should stop and think about how that would make<br/>
them feel, especially since my kids tell me how much<br/>
in bothers them.  Talking to them doesn&#39;t help, they<br/>
just don&#39;t get it.<br/>

&gt; his <br/>

&gt; &gt; did this to themselves.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First I need to say I am a grandma. My fourth<br/>
&gt; grandaughter is due to <br/>
&gt; arrive next week. As much as you love your kids, you<br/>
&gt; love your <br/>
&gt; grandkids and you do not have the same ability and<br/>
&gt; access to your <br/>
&gt; grandchildren, especially if they are your sons<br/>
&gt; children.I know that <br/>
&gt; sounds sexist, but truly it is not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Both of my dil are beautiful girls whom I completely<br/>
&gt; love. They let <br/>
&gt; me love their children. They generously share them<br/>
&gt; with me and love <br/>

&gt; My oldest sons first wife did not like me. She hated<br/>

&gt; she divorced my son she made it almost impossible to<br/>
&gt; access my <br/>
&gt; grandaughter. It broke my heart. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some of my children are also adopted and we see<br/>
&gt; there birth <br/>
&gt; families. As far as I can tell you cannot have to<br/>
&gt; many people that <br/>
&gt; love you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My kids birthfamilies are not folks that I might<br/>
&gt; choose to be <br/>
&gt; friends with if we did not share children. But they<br/>
&gt; are my kids <br/>
&gt; birthfamilies and because I love my kids I make them<br/>
&gt; comfortable and <br/>
&gt; I treat them with respect and kindness. They are my<br/>
&gt; family. I also <br/>
&gt; set boundaries with the ones who are less<br/>
&gt; appropriate so my kids <br/>
&gt; feel safe and can appreciate the contact. Like we<br/>

&gt; visit I work very <br/>
&gt; hard to make sure my child and this birthfamily<br/>
&gt; member are engaging <br/>
&gt; in positive interactions so my kids will feel good<br/>
&gt; about the contact.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yesterday former dil called and asked if I wanted to<br/>
&gt; see <br/>
&gt; grandaughter.  She lives 21 hours away and it is a<br/>
&gt; rarity to have <br/>
&gt; any access.I said I would love that. They spent six<br/>
&gt; hours at my <br/>
&gt; house, former dil and grandaughter. I fed them,<br/>
&gt; chatted and chose to <br/>
&gt; practice kindness and tolerance despite that fact<br/>
&gt; that this girl <br/>
&gt; devistated my son and has done some very cruel<br/>
&gt; things to my family, <br/>
&gt; includinng malicious untruths about me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She is the mother of my grandaughter, therefore she<br/>
&gt; is also my <br/>
&gt; family. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know there are situation where family needs to<br/>
&gt; have boundaries <br/>
&gt; set. Where hurts need to heal, but communication and<br/>
&gt; kindness can <br/>
&gt; bridge many gaps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am sorry your family is split and hurting over<br/>
&gt; this. It is really <br/>
&gt; sad for everyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-910850329">Su,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.  You have described my in-laws to a tee. <br/>
They aren&#39;t very affectionate at all.  When my kids<br/>
used to go visit, they would say hi, asked what they<br/>
were learning, and then over an hour later, say good<br/>
bye to them without speaking any other words to them<br/>
inbetween.  (This comes from both of my kids, and not<br/>
told to me by my husband.)<br/>
<br/>
I believe that children need to be loved and nurtured,<br/>
and they don&#39;t get that from the grandparents that<br/>
live in town, and they know this.  They are not<br/>
comfortable visiting over there, so why should they be<br/>
forced to go.  My son has told me that he would rather<br/>
not see them, and as part of the unschooling life<br/>
style, shouldn&#39;t I honor his wishes?<br/>
<br/>
I do understand how you feel.  My dad&#39;s dad was an<br/>
alchoholic, and beat his kids all of the time.  Later<br/>
in life, when I was forced to go for a visit, he did<br/>
some things that no one should have happen to them.  I<br/>
am not trying to sound cold, but thank God he died<br/>
before my kids were born.  He would never be allowed<br/>
to see my kids, ever.<br/>
<br/>
It is part of my job to see that my kids are<br/>
comfortable in any situation, and this is one that<br/>
they are not.  Their grandparents here may love them,<br/>
but they never show it.  Just like being a parent is a<br/>
full time job, so is being a grandparent.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for understanding Su.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can jump in on this one even though I&#39;m not the<br/>
&gt; original poster! My  <br/>
&gt; older son doesn&#39;t much care to see my parents<br/>
&gt; because my parents are  <br/>
&gt; not very affectionate. My father doesn&#39;t know how to<br/>
&gt; give my older  <br/>
&gt; son Eric, who is six, time to warm up when we first<br/>
&gt; arrive at their  <br/>
&gt; house, but immediately wants Eric to, say, hug, him.<br/>
&gt; This has been  <br/>
&gt; the pattern since Eric was 2 or so:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My dad: Give grandpa a hug!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Eric stands quietly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My dad: Give me a hug!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Eric scoots closer to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My dad, yelling: ERIC! COME GIVE GRANDPA A HUG!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Eric gets into my lap and stays there for an hour.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Carl, 3, is much quicker to warm up, and has a more<br/>
&gt; outgoing  <br/>
&gt; personality. In the last year, when we visit, my<br/>
&gt; mother doesn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; bother to hide her preference for Carl over Eric.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My whole life, my parents treated me badly because I<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t what they  <br/>
&gt; wanted in a daughter. Now they are increasingly<br/>
&gt; indifferent to my  <br/>
&gt; kids, Eric especially, because he doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
&gt; fit some  <br/>
&gt; preconceived notion they have about what a grandson<br/>
&gt; should be like.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Neither of my parents is able to think of others,<br/>
&gt; and put someone  <br/>
&gt; else&#39;s feelings ahead of their own. Not even small<br/>
&gt; children&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why wouldn&#39;t a kid want to see his grandparents?<br/>
&gt; Because he&#39;s smart  <br/>
&gt; enough not to want to go where he is not valued and<br/>
&gt; treated well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can be attached to 20 sets of grandparents, or<br/>
&gt; you can have<br/>
&gt; &gt; grandparents that you are not always thrilled with<br/>
&gt; but you know love<br/>
&gt; &gt; you and are just who they are.It is not a contest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How do you know they love you if they never treat<br/>
&gt; you like they do? I  <br/>
&gt; recently read &quot;The Five Love Languages for Children&quot;<br/>
&gt; because it was  <br/>
&gt; being discussed on AlwaysUnschooled. According to<br/>
&gt; the authors, there  <br/>
&gt; are five &quot;love languages&quot;: gifts, acts of service,<br/>
&gt; quality time,  <br/>
&gt; physical touch, and words of affirmation. Amazingly,<br/>
&gt; my parents  <br/>
&gt; managed not to speak any of them, while maintaining<br/>
&gt; a facade that we  <br/>
&gt; were a successful, happy family. I do suspect they<br/>
&gt; love me, or think  <br/>
&gt; they do, but it is a lot to ask of a child that she<br/>
&gt; &quot;know her  <br/>
&gt; grandparents love her&quot; and accept them for who they<br/>
&gt; are when they are  <br/>
&gt; not showing love in any meaningful way and do not<br/>
&gt; accept her for who  <br/>
&gt; she is. I am in my 40s and only just getting the<br/>
&gt; hang of this with my  <br/>
&gt; parents, as I develop more compassion for them and<br/>
&gt; their own  <br/>
&gt; childhoods--if you look at the families they came<br/>
&gt; from, full of  <br/>
&gt; alcoholism and violence, my parents are miracles for<br/>
&gt; not passing  <br/>
&gt; those dysfunctions on. But they still fell far short<br/>
&gt; of giving me and  <br/>
&gt; my brother the love and affirmation children need to<br/>
&gt; thrive, and, as  <br/>
&gt; grandparents, they are materially generous but cold<br/>
&gt; and not  <br/>
&gt; affectionate.<br/>

find a mutally acceptable solution with the kids for getting <br/>
together, or for dad to be more comfortable with the kids&#39; decision. <br/>
<br/>
On another level, though, I don&#39;t think it matters so much *why* <br/>
they don&#39;t want to see their grandparents. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right, but its not okay to *make* kids visit adults they don&#39;t want <br/>
to spend time with, regardless of the degress of relationship. It <br/>
doesn&#39;t improve the relationship, and it harms the development of  <br/>
autonomy and personal boundaries.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t gotten the impression from the original poster that this <br/>
is an issue between her and her mil. The issue is that the *kids* <br/>
have decided they don&#39;t want to see these grandparents. <br/>
<br/>
It can be really challenging for kids to visit extended family or <br/>
other adults who don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; unschooling and treat them <br/>
disrespectfully. Sometimes its possible to work out ways to connect <br/>
that are mutually respectful, but not always. <br/>

I am not saying you are the evil dil at all. I am just trying to <br/>
share other perspectives.<br/>
<br/>
My family is a mess too and one of the realizations that have <br/>
happened for me personally is that my kids are not emotionally <br/>
dependent on my folks or my dh folks. They are emotionally dependent <br/>
on us to give them the love, support and nuturing they need. <br/>
Anything they get from grandparents is a bonus.<br/>
<br/>
The definition for a role as a grandparent come from us by some sort <br/>
of standard defined by society.  <br/>
<br/>
GRANDPARENTS go see everything there grandkids do<br/>
<br/>
Grandparents bake cookies and love to have their grandkids over<br/>
<br/>
Grandparents want to buy their grandkids lots of stuff<br/>
<br/>
Grandparents want to take their grandkids for the weekend and love <br/>
to play board games with them.<br/>
<br/>
Who set that definition?<br/>
<br/>
I do not accept definitions that my kids need to do _______by this <br/>
date, or age. Why must I accept defitions of how my kids <br/>
grandparents are supposed to behave. <br/>
<br/>
That does not mean I allow my children to be abused or mistreated by <br/>
anyone, including their grandparents.<br/>
<br/>
My mom is very much not into being a grandma. She owns it and NEVER <br/>
wants to be responsible for kids. She was not thrilled about it when <br/>
she was my primary care giver. However she is a talented poet and <br/>
writer.  When she visits I always ask her to bring her new poems. <br/>
They are full of social injustices and sometimes gut wrenchingly <br/>
beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
The kids and I love to sit and have her recite for us. That is what <br/>
she gives us. That is it. She never remembers anyones birthday. She <br/>
does not want to send Christmas gifts.She never wants the kids to <br/>
visit or stay over. She loves her grandkids in her way. It was just <br/>
a process for me to accept that her way was not what I thought she <br/>
should be.<br/>
<br/>
 Year ago when my dad was alive he did not want my kids to call him <br/>
grandpa. He however was really into meditation. One day I asked if <br/>
he would teach us all to meditate in his style. My boys and I had <br/>
been talking about how cool it looked to watch him. He spent an hour <br/>
explaining meditation to us and helping us become centered. We <br/>
connected with him where he was at and my kids still talk about that <br/>
experience with warm memories. They also laugh at his lack of <br/>
willingness to be a grandpa. <br/>
<br/>
I am once again sorry for your situation and hope it resolves itself <br/>
in a way that works for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I am also sorry if you felt attacked. I am not an attacker, but <br/>
often like to take the other perspective if it is a situation I can <br/>
see through different lenses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935515471">Kathleen,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel attacked.  So there is no problem there.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t expect them to show up to every concert, but<br/>
when they chose one grandchild over the others, that<br/>
was a little hard for our family to take.<br/>
<br/>
I once remember that my fil told my son, you are my<br/>
favorite grandson, when Jon isn&#39;t around.  Luckily my<br/>
son was young and didn&#39;t catch it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect anything out of my il, because they<br/>
give nothing.  All my kids would like from them is to<br/>
show some kind of affection, and to show some interest<br/>
in them.  They show neither.<br/>
<br/>
My mil wants my daughter to be something she&#39;s not,<br/>
and can&#39;t accept her for who she is, which is the same<br/>
way with my son.  My kids don&#39;t expect anything from<br/>
their grandparents here either.  They are not<br/>
materialistic, they are not being raised that way, so<br/>
whether or not their grandparents buy them stuff is<br/>
not an important part of the relationship they once<br/>
had.  My parents don&#39;t buy them lots of stuff, but<br/>
spend quality time with them, which is what my kids<br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
I understand your perspective on things with you being<br/>
a grandparent.  Things are different in each family,<br/>
and right now the kids want nothing to do with their<br/>
grandparents that live close to us.  When they are<br/>
ready, and feel like they want to, they can go see<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I also do not like labels or definitions.  Life is<br/>
meant to be lived to fullest extent, and to be<br/>
enjoyed.  Right now they are enjoying life, and having<br/>
fun, and have no added stress from their grandparents<br/>
here.  All I want is for my kids to be happy and care<br/>
free.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I am not mad at you, and don&#39;t think you were<br/>
calling me evil.  You were just trying to show me a<br/>
different perspective, and I appreciate that.<br/>

<br/>
I am not trying to make it all or nothing.  My kids<br/>
are free to visit their grandparents anytime they<br/>
like, at their house.  DH&#39;s parents are not allowed in<br/>
my house anymore, after taking years of mental abuse/<br/>
mean comments made in my own house, or things that<br/>
were said to my hubby about me.  I want to feel<br/>
comfortable and safe in my own house, and I don&#39;t when<br/>
I&#39;m here and so are they.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like dh to be hurt, but at the same time, my<br/>
first and most important priority is my kids.  If they<br/>
decide to go to breakfast, they want to stuff their<br/>
mouths full, so they don&#39;t have to talk to their<br/>
grandparents, which to me is unhealthy.  It&#39;s better<br/>
to avoid the situation altogether.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is up to the kids, if they want to visit<br/>
their grandparents or not.  I think if they are given<br/>
time and space, they may want to see them on their<br/>
own.  Until then, I will do what they need me to do,<br/>
and give them lots of love and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t need negativity in their life, and with<br/>
their grandparents here, that is what they get, when<br/>
they aren&#39;t getting nosey with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Again, if they want to visit their grandparents, I<br/>
have no problem with it.  They just don&#39;t want to.<br/>

<br/>
You are right.  This is not an issue between me and my<br/>
mil.  We haven&#39;t gotten along for years now, but I<br/>
will never stop the kids from seeing their<br/>
grandparents.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t make my kids see their grandparents.  Whether<br/>
they want to or not, is totally up to them, and I have<br/>
to support their decision.<br/>
<br/>
There is no connection or bond with this set of<br/>
grandparents.  They have never made the effort, and<br/>
are always playing with other people&#39;s kids, and not<br/>
them (my kids).  My kids are at the age now where they<br/>
have been noticing this for quite some time now, and<br/>
are not comfortable around them.<br/>
<br/>
I did try for a while to get  them involved with our<br/>
kids, but once they got out of the cutesy baby/toddler<br/>
stage, they weren&#39;t interested in them any more.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this situation getting any better.  The<br/>
best thing I can do is support my kids, and let them<br/>
decide what they want to do.  There is no show of love<br/>
and affection towards them, which is really sad,<br/>
because they never did anything to deserve this.  It&#39;s<br/>
not our problem, it is their&#39;s, and they are missing<br/>
out on two really teriffic kids.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for understanding Meredith.  It is hard, but I<br/>
don&#39;t expect my kids to do things, that I wouldn&#39;t do.<br/>
 I know there is a difference because I am an adult<br/>
and they are kids, but I want them to enjoy life, and<br/>
not worry about adult things.<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not there is a relationship between them<br/>
and the grandparents that live near us is up to them. <br/>
I won&#39;t force them into anything, it will only<br/>
backfire.<br/>

&gt; I can see where this would be relevant if the grands<br/>
&gt; were looking to <br/>
&gt; find a mutally acceptable solution with the kids for<br/>
&gt; getting <br/>
&gt; together, or for dad to be more comfortable with the<br/>
&gt; kids&#39; decision. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On another level, though, I don&#39;t think it matters<br/>
&gt; so much *why* <br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t want to see their grandparents. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; you can have <br/>
&gt; &gt; grandparents that you are not always thrilled with<br/>
&gt; but you know <br/>
&gt; love <br/>
&gt; &gt; you and are just who they are.It is not a contest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Right, but its not okay to *make* kids visit adults<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t want <br/>
&gt; to spend time with, regardless of the degress of<br/>
&gt; relationship. It <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t improve the relationship, and it harms the<br/>
&gt; development of  <br/>
&gt; autonomy and personal boundaries.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Both of my dil are beautiful girls whom I<br/>
&gt; completely love. They <br/>
&gt; let <br/>
&gt; &gt; me love their children. They generously share them<br/>
&gt; with me and <br/>
&gt; love <br/>
&gt; &gt; me despite my faults.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t gotten the impression from the original<br/>
&gt; poster that this <br/>
&gt; is an issue between her and her mil. The issue is<br/>
&gt; that the *kids* <br/>
&gt; have decided they don&#39;t want to see these<br/>
&gt; grandparents. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It can be really challenging for kids to visit<br/>
&gt; extended family or <br/>
&gt; other adults who don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; unschooling and treat<br/>
&gt; them <br/>
&gt; disrespectfully. Sometimes its possible to work out<br/>
&gt; ways to connect <br/>
&gt; that are mutually respectful, but not always. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854915236">My problem is kind of unique.  I&#39;m the grandma, but I&#39;m also the<br/>
mother of an unschooling 13yo.<br/>
<br/>
Two marriages, two sets of children.  My oldest son is married and<br/>
they have 2 kids (7yo & 6yo).  both grandchildren attend a very<br/>
prestigeous private school and are pushed into sports, ballet, etc. <br/>
My grandkids love to come over because they can eat what they want, go<br/>
to bed when they are tired, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
They spent last week with us in Palm Springs.  We had such a blast. At<br/>
the end of the week my grandson told me he wanted to come live with us<br/>
because we don&#39;t yell.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is my DIL, she is very concerned about our 13yo.  Many<br/>
times she has taken my dd out for lunch and told her she is missing<br/>
out on all kinds of &quot;stuff&quot; by not going to school.  In fact this past<br/>
year has been a real struggle with dil.  Elizabeth has made comments<br/>
about maybe wanting to attend hs, because she doesn&#39;t want to miss out.<br/>
<br/>
I have actually sat down and informed my dil that she needs to keep<br/>
her opinion to herself.  But, my dd looks up to my dil who is 30 yo. <br/>
I&#39;m 53 and out of touch.  DIL also denies that she is trying to<br/>
interfere, but dd has told me differently.<br/>
<br/>
DIL has even influenced my grandkids, they have on a few occasions<br/>
said things like &quot;oh that&#39;s right Elizabeth doesn&#39;t do or go to<br/>
school&quot; and this is in a very condesending tone.<br/>
<br/>
I have the book &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; and when Elizabeth<br/>
comes to me and says she really wants to go to high school, I&#39;ll ask<br/>
her to please read the book first and then if she still feels she must<br/>
attend HS, then I have no choice but to honor that choice.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am on a tight rope.  I need to keep things ok with dil<br/>
so I can see my beautiful grandchildren, but my dd&#39;s priorities are<br/>
first. Oh and my dh is very upset by dil&#39;s interference.  My son just<br/>
tells his wife to keep her mouth shut.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666567067">I feel for you.  I have had similar problems, but my<br/>
kids don&#39;t feel like they are missing out.  They are<br/>
almost 10 and 11.<br/>
<br/>
I think what you might want to do is ask your 13yo<br/>
what she feels she&#39;s missing out on.  I&#39;ve been asked<br/>
by several family members, what about the prom, how<br/>
will they go to college, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s up to your dil to tell your 13yo<br/>
that she&#39;s missing out on things.  If your daughter is<br/>
happy, there is no problem, and it sounds like she is.<br/>
<br/>
If public school works for your grandchildren, then<br/>
that&#39;s ok.  My kids had a horrible time in public<br/>
school, and I wish I would&#39;ve pulled them out sooner. <br/>
Just because she doesn&#39;t go to school, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
she is learning.  There is so much out there in the<br/>
world to learn, and to do.  You don&#39;t get that from<br/>
sitting behind a desk for 6-8 hours a day, learning a<br/>
little of this and that, and not anything interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am with you, and I can see why it would upset your<br/>
husband too.  I&#39;ve been through high school, and she&#39;s<br/>
not missing anything.  No peer pressure, drugs, bombs,<br/>
threats, etc.  My son actually had a death threat<br/>
against him, and he&#39;s only 11. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some.  I think your dil needs to<br/>
encourage your 13 yo, not tell her what she feels your<br/>
daughter is missing.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, and let me know how things go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438089562">We have issues with my FIL along these lines... mostly that he expects<br/>
them to be thrilled to see him when he has been abusive physically,<br/>
verbally and emotionally to our entire family.    They don&#39;t trust him<br/>
and it&#39;s not likely to change just because now and then he shows up<br/>
and wants them to be thrilled to see him or that he sends a gift<br/>
(suddenly after 15 plus years of barely acknowledging holidays or our<br/>
existence he&#39;s santa claus... again he is giving things and not<br/>
himself)  When he visits he spends his time telling the children how<br/>
they can improve themselves and all the things that we are doing wrong<br/>
as parents.    We have had lengthy periods of no contact with him<br/>
because he is just not a &quot;safe&quot; person.    My kids say they feel<br/>
&quot;icky&quot; when he is around .... my oldest says she is sure it must be<br/>
how kids feel when someone molests them.   I have tried many times<br/>
over the years to foster some sort of relationship, I am respectful of<br/>
him as a person but have had to make it clear that he will be asked to<br/>
leave if his presence becomes harmful.   Typically he shows up, my<br/>
kids say hello and then disappear only showing up again to say good<br/>
bye when he leaves.    I can&#39;t MAKE him love us no matter how much my<br/>
husband wants him to and it&#39;s heartbreaking.  I feel a certain<br/>
responsibility to keep my kids safe...physically and emotionally so I<br/>
have to limit the contact with this person.   It&#39;s heartbreaking that<br/>
this sad, lonely, widowed  man is missing out on a relationship with<br/>
his only grandchildren because he&#39;s chosen to be selfish over the<br/>
years with his time and attention.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-695704094">This conversation reminds me of something I read of few years ago about  <br/>
grandparents by Jan Hunt of The Natural Child Project.  It seems that in  our <br/>
culture many grandparents think that grandchildren should automatically  respect <br/>
the grandparents.  Jan believes that the children should gain the  respect of <br/>
the children.   <br/>
 <br/>
Why would a grandchild want to spend time with a grandparent who does not  <br/>
put time or effort into that relationship?  Why would anyone want to be in  a <br/>
relationship where the other party does not seem interested.  It does not  mean <br/>
that the grandparent has to go to every baseball game, etc.  But, if  they do <br/>
not put in any effort, then of course a free child is aware enough to  realize <br/>
that they deserve to have a relationship that is a two way street.   They <br/>
should not have to be around a grandparent that thinks that the child has  to be <br/>
around them just because they are the grandparent.  I certainly would  not <br/>
want my child to be in any relationship (now or as an adult) where they  did not <br/>
feel that they could be their authentic selves and have the other party  <br/>
interested in them.  <br/>
 <br/>
Is it possible that the dh in this case may still be struggling with  <br/>
pleasing his parents, and doing what they demand, whether or not he  authentically <br/>
wants to do it.  If he really does want to be with his  parents, and the <br/>
children do not; then have him go and the children stay.   That is a compromise in my <br/>
eyes.  The dh is getting his needs met to see  his parents.  The children are <br/>
getting there needs met of not seeing the  grandparents.  Pushing one into <br/>
seeing someone that they do not want to  see, will usually have the reverse <br/>
effect:  they will want to see that  person even less.  <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe the suggestion of having the il over to the grandchildrens&#39; house  <br/>
would work.  That would have to be decided by all the family  members, adults and <br/>
children alike.  <br/>
 <br/>
Not all grandparents want to love their grandchildren.  Some do, like  one of <br/>
the posters here.  Many don&#39;t.  Some see it as a duty.   Others see it as the <br/>
*childrens* duty to respect and love them, when they  do nothing for the <br/>
children.  As in all relationships, it should be a  give and take, with *mutual* <br/>
respect, regardless of age.     <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904844041">Cynthia,<br/>
<br/>
You could be right.  Maybe dh feels the need to go see<br/>
his parents.  The kids really don&#39;t want to see them,<br/>
and I stand by their decision.<br/>
<br/>
I have always told dh he can visit his parents any<br/>
time he would like, at their house.  They are not<br/>
allowed in my house for the nasty comments they have<br/>
made to me in front of my kids about the way our house<br/>
looks (it&#39;s not white glove, but it is also not messy,<br/>
either.) or that I should do this or that with the<br/>
kids.  Nothing I ever do is right. They constantly<br/>
criticize, and it&#39;s not healthy for my kids or for me.<br/>
 Dh probably doesn&#39;t see this, because he is used to<br/>
it, or because of the fact that they always make the<br/>
comments when he is not around.<br/>
<br/>
Right now my kids are very comfortable not seeing<br/>
their grandparents that live close, and would rather<br/>
see mine that are 550 miles away.  Not because they<br/>
spend money on them (they are both retired and are on<br/>
limited income), but because they spend quality time<br/>
with them, by having campfires, playing games,<br/>
watching movies, etc.  The grandparents that are here,<br/>
do none of that.<br/>
<br/>
I have told dh several times that if he pushed the<br/>
kids into visiting his parents it will only backfire,<br/>
and will do more harm than good.  I think if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t push them, it might take some time, but they<br/>
may come around on their own.  If they don&#39;t, than<br/>
that&#39;s ok too.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that dh had a talk with his brother, and<br/>
told him that they (his parents) had their chance, and<br/>
blew it when they paid more attention to other peoples<br/>
kids, and not ours.  So he knows the kids have<br/>
problems with his parents, but I think he just doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to accept it.<br/>
<br/>
They ( il) constantly pick at the kids and will tell<br/>
dd to sit up there and eat (she&#39;s a slow eater, and<br/>
gets full easier than ds), and will make comments<br/>
about ds being over weight, and things like that.  All<br/>
of the boys on dh&#39;s side of the family are built big. <br/>
Mil has no daughters, only 3 sons.  I have the only<br/>
granddaughter in this side of the family.  The sad<br/>
part is that they don&#39;t know my kids, and have never<br/>
taken the time to get to know them.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids have adjusted well, and are very comfortable<br/>
with who they are, and what they are doing.  They know<br/>
that they are loved, and very well taken care of with<br/>
all of the support and nurturing they need from me and<br/>
dh.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

may come around on their own.  If they don&#39;t, than<br/>
that&#39;s ok too.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My mother is good with babies and very little children. But as soon as <br/>
they have her number, she can&#39;t handle it. She sees them as <br/>
manipulative when they don&#39;t do as she says or when they want something <br/>
she&#39;s not ready or doesn&#39;t want to give them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always given both boys a choice on whether to visit her or not. <br/>
They&#39;re now 19 and 11.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve told her point blank that I *WILL* keep the boys from her if <br/>
she cannot behave around them. My boys&#39; physical and emotional health <br/>
is far more important to me than her need to see and spend time with <br/>
them. I *have* kept them away from her for months at a time (and we <br/>
llive in the same city) until she&#39;s ready to &quot;play nice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s happened is that she&#39;s now (usually) nice to the boys. But more <br/>
importantly, my boys are nice to her. Given the *choice* to be with her <br/>
or not has empowered them to be kinder because they understand they <br/>
don&#39;t *have* to be there---it&#39;s their *choice*---and they certainly can <br/>
choose to be somewhere else. If they choose to be with *her*---well, <br/>
they *want* to be there, and they make the best of it. That&#39;s better <br/>
for *all* of them (us!).<br/>
<br/>
I feel sure that if we had forced them to spend time with her, they <br/>
would have resented her and us and eventually refused to spend *any* <br/>
time with her at all.<br/>
<br/>
I think the older they get, the more they can handle difficult people. <br/>
But when they&#39;re too little to stand up to her (or drive away!), the <br/>
more it&#39;s *my* resposibility to protect them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-222950017">Hi, I&#39;m a lurker here trying to learn as much as I possibly can.  I <br/>
admit that I have not totally embraced the freedom for children that <br/>
many of you espouse.  I couldn&#39;t help but add my 2 cents here.<br/>
  I am a single mom and have at times stuggled with my relationship <br/>
and my daughter&#39;s relationship with my mom.  What I have learned in <br/>
the process is<br/>
<br/>
1 - Safety is first.  ALWAYS.  No compromising on this one.<br/>
2 - Validate my daughter&#39;s feelings and my mom&#39;s.  &quot;Wow.  It really <br/>
is frustrating when Grandma is constantly telling you to do things.  <br/>
I remember how tough she was when I was growing up.&quot;  &quot;Gee, Mom, I <br/>
can see how it hurts you that she&#39;s not happy to see you even though <br/>
you bought her a gift.&quot; - NO BUTs at this point.  Let them just feel <br/>
like you see their point.<br/>
3 - Eventually teach.  Don&#39;t make excuses or argue. Teach. When your <br/>
grandparent is ready give small concise instructions on how to make <br/>
things work better.  Remember that they may still choose to blame and <br/>
complain rather than learn but try to give them small concise things <br/>
in a friendly non-judgemental way to help the relationship.  A big <br/>
one for my daughter was telling my mom not to lecture.  I briefly <br/>
explained that since my daughter is entering those teenage years she <br/>
prefers brief explanations so please try to keep instructions to 5-10 <br/>
words.  I had to tell my mom 50 times or so (and smile every time) <br/>
but she is doing a lot better.<br/>
4 - Teach your kids too. Once again try not to be judgemental or make <br/>
excuses.  Think about it for a moment.  How would you explain both <br/>
sides of any major war?  How would you explain various world <br/>
religions?  Is there a RIGHT and a WRONG or do they both have good <br/>
and bad points?  Try to see the point of view that the grandparents <br/>
are coming from.  They probably came from a generation in which <br/>
adults (especially older adults) were given respect because they were <br/>
older than you.  Age earned respect.  Also, many feel that their <br/>
physical abuse is ok because it&#39;s not as bad as what they grew up <br/>
with.  When my grandparents called my mom had to run to answer or she <br/>
was in trouble and during that time period that was &#39;normal&#39;.  I made <br/>
a CHOICE to not raise my child the way I was raised but my mom wasn&#39;t <br/>
part of that choice and doesn&#39;t know another way.  She is coming <br/>
around.  Explaining these ideas and motivations to kids honestly and <br/>
exposing them for what they are allows kids the power to understand <br/>
and choose anger or compassion.<br/>
<br/>
These are the things that have made my family able to live with one <br/>
another.  Yes, we 3 live together.  Some days I feel like I have 2 <br/>
children and my daughter is the oldest but most of the time it <br/>
works.  My mom has become handicapped and we have gone from not <br/>
speaking to a fairly good realtionship where we live together and I <br/>
take care of the physical needs and she takes care of the financial <br/>
needs.  She is even teaching my daughter to cross-stitch (MIRACLE!) <br/>
with only a little bit of fighting.<br/>
