<div id="ygrps-yiv-912436476">&lt;&lt;&lt; Okay, so how do you start dreads -- in caucasian hair, mind you --  <br/>
without leaving it unwashed.  I mean, how can you wash hair you can&#39;t comb <br/>
or untangle?  And how do you get hair tangled/tied/mashed together like that <br/>
when it&#39;s clean?<br/>
<br/>
  Real questions, in case the issue comes up again.<br/>
<br/>
  Sylvia&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
Start by googling Dreadlocks.  There are TONS of websites out there with <br/>
information, products, pictures etc. that explain all about dreadlocks. They <br/>
all explain how dreadlocks are started, how they are maintained, and how to <br/>
keep your scalp clean.<br/>
While there are people that create their dreadlocks by simply not brushing <br/>
(they still wash) many people get dreads by going to a salon, or having a <br/>
friend do it. It takes about 8 hours on average to dread hair.<br/>
Go ahead and google it, I think you&#39;ll learn alot.<br/>
