<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231811216">Maybe they are trying to understand the perspective of a friend or family member who radically unschools and rather then harm her relationship with her friend or family member chooses to work out her issues with strangers? Sounds like something my mom might do. <br/>

Since I&#39;m not on AU, I&#39;d like to hear a bit more about Paul&#39;s family <br/>
and what unschooling looks like in his home. I see in his lengthy <br/>
posts plenty of other people&#39;s studies and links, but little personal <br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
On a local list, we had a woman ask to subscribe. She proceeded to <br/>
tell the list owner that she wasn&#39;t a radical unschooler and had no <br/>
intention of becoming one.  She apparently just wanted to hang out <br/>
with unschooling families, though. I wonder why? Do such people come <br/>
to us just to argue? Anyone have any insight on this?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m asking because I&#39;m now a moderator on the local list and I want to <br/>
understand why people who have no interest in being a radical <br/>
unschooler want to join a radical unschooling group.<br/>
<br/>
If this is more appropriate to talk about off-list, e-mail me privately.<br/>
