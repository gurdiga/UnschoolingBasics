<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740601784">This was passed on to me. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re unschoolers or if  <br/>
there will be scenes of the kids doing curriculum or not, but just  <br/>
the fact that they&#39;re doing this looks interesting :-) -- Joyce<br/>

==================<br/>
<br/>
Hi I was wondering if you could pass this information along to your  <br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
Hi my name is Kati Loud.  My family and I are homeschoolers. We RV  <br/>
full time and we have a show airing on TLC called Six For The Road   <br/>
It is  about our life and journey. One year ago we gave away and sold  <br/>
everything we own and bought a fifth wheel and hit the road. We  <br/>
realized that we became caught up in life and became so busy with  <br/>
daily routines that we needed to take back our life. So we did what  <br/>
we have always dreamed of. We decided to leave it all behind and we  <br/>
have never looked back.<br/>
<br/>
We love roadschooling! We have enjoyed learning so much while we are  <br/>
on the road. We have been able to learn hands on in the most able  <br/>
places. We have been from Williamsburg to the Toilet Seat Museum. We  <br/>
have been to NYC and experienced the big city and we have been to a  <br/>
small town in Tennessee to help tornado victims try to put their life  <br/>
back together. We have done this as a family and we have loved it.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to go from 3500 square feet to 300 square feet. We have  <br/>
four kids. Two girls 15 and 13 and two boys 12 and 10. We also have 3  <br/>
dogs and a little hamster. Life in an RV can get really crowded and  <br/>
hectic but it is fun.  The first 2 episodes air on October 29 Eastern  <br/>
Mountain and Pacific time zones are at 10:00pm and Central is at  <br/>
9:00pm. Our next two episodes air on November 5th. Same times. Each  <br/>
night they will show 2 episode in a row. Please watch and help us  <br/>
show how many homeschoolers may be interested in a show like this. We  <br/>
are on right after Jon and Kate plus Eight. Our production company  <br/>
also does there show.<br/>
<br/>
Please pass this info along to anyone that you think may be  <br/>
interested. If you would like TiVo the show and even turn all your  <br/>
TV�s on to help our numbersJ We also re- air that night at 1:00am if  <br/>
you want to TiVo that also J<br/>
<br/>
We have a website at www.ourloudfamily.com    We are having our site  <br/>
re built and it will be 100% in a week or so. We have a great forum  <br/>
for homeschooling info, travel ideas, etc. We have our blogs that are  <br/>
stories and pictures of our journeys. We do have a contest right  <br/>
now . We our looking for people to help us design 3 new bumper  <br/>
stickers. There is a $100.oo first prize for each one.  Here is the  <br/>
link for the dimensions etc   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ourloudfamily.com/blog/view/">http://ourloudfamily.com/blog/view/</a> <br/>

<br/>
If you go to our site you can sign up as a member. By doing this you  <br/>
can get Homeschool deals, travel deals and updates.  We also have a  <br/>
MySpace type program for families. This is a safe MySpace type page  <br/>
program without a lot of junk added. Just go and design a page. We  <br/>
have around 200 homeschool members right now. This has been a fun way  <br/>
to meet other moms and to see pics of each other�s families and learn  <br/>
about their styles and making new friends.<br/>
<br/>
We will also be on the TODAY show October 29th during the 9:00 am  <br/>
hour. They may have a glimpse of the show for you to see. If  and if  <br/>
you enjoyed the show  and you would like to let the network or our  <br/>
producers know go to our website after the show and we will have  <br/>
contact info for you.<br/>
<br/>
We would love to have you pass the word to all that you can.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails to you and hope to meet some of you soon our travels.<br/>
<br/>
