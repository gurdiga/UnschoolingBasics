<div id="ygrps-yiv-985793570">I started running a homeschool gym day this year for our rural <br/>
area.  We have only had a few families participating (most do school at <br/>
home & have told me they don&#39;t have time in their schedule to take <br/>
their kids to an activity that they would &quot;just play&quot; at).  But it <br/>
actually works well with just a few families and 6-8 kids usually, plus <br/>
moms, who are also encouraged to play:)  My kids weren&#39;t interested in <br/>
doing organized sports, probably because we haven&#39;t really encouraged <br/>
or explored those programs at all- we live pretty far out in the <br/>
country and it would involve a lot of time and driving- we tend to like <br/>
to stay home most of the week, but anyways...<br/>
<br/>
  For gym day we do all sorts of &quot;just fun&quot; run around games- freeze <br/>
tag, relay races, jump ropes & a bunch of other games I got from a <br/>
couple of cooperative gym games books.  One of the families likes <br/>
organized sports and sometimes her kids suggest kick ball or soccer- <br/>
which doesn&#39;t usually go over well since her kids know the rules and <br/>
get upset when the other kids don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the game, and my kids usually <br/>
get upset when they aren&#39;t as good as her boys at playing soccer for <br/>
instance.  We would practice that more if they wanted. <br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s been fun to get out of the house during the winter for this a <br/>
couple of times a month (we started with once a week, but my car died <br/>
before the holidays, etc, etc).   And it&#39;s mostly the same kids who <br/>
come to our homeschool 4H group, but it&#39;s fun to be able to just run <br/>
around and play and not have an &quot;academic learning activity&quot; (which <br/>
most of the moms want at 4H).  Plus, the moms get to have fun and play <br/>
too!<br/>
