<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267966449">My kids are experiencing upset in their lives right now and are acting <br/>
out often with hostility toward each other (well, and me, too). They are <br/>
dd9, dd11 and ds13. Their birth mother is wanting them &quot;back&quot; (they have <br/>
never lived with her except when she joined them at their grandmother&#39;s, <br/>
and that last happened over 5 years ago). They are feeling torn and <br/>
worse. Their lashing out at each other really leaves me confused about <br/>
how to respond--especially at the youngest who was (and still is in some <br/>
ways) her mother&#39;s scapegoat. I understand that they are in pain, but I <br/>
feel that kids should not have to deal with abuse even if its from <br/>
another kid. They mostly call each other names and pick on every little <br/>
thing but it sometimes gets physical. Sometimes it means a trip to <br/>
urgent care (usually from &quot;playful&quot; roughhousing, though).<br/>
<br/>
We are new to unschooling. I don&#39;t want to just send them to their rooms <br/>
  or whatever I used to do as punishment. They are also sick of my <br/>
explaining to them how their behavior makes the other sibling feel, that <br/>
everyone has a right to be safe in their own home, etc. When I ask them <br/>
how they are feeling/why they are being mean to each other, they either <br/>
don&#39;t know or don&#39;t believe that they are being any different than <br/>
usual. I&#39;m trying to ride through this period as lovingly as I can but <br/>
we&#39;re all upset.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Robin... I replied in some of your other posts about this same situation and<br/>
at the risk of sounding like a broken record:<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re probably feeling insecure about their future.  I don&#39;t know though<br/>
because I&#39;m not there.  If this is the case, have you reassured them or do<br/>
you even have any grounds to be able to reassure them of being able to stay<br/>
with you where they feel safe?  Do you even want them to stay and, if you<br/>
do, have you said so?  It seems obvious to me that you care very deeply.<br/>
I&#39;m reading your posts though and I can&#39;t tell if they&#39;re welcome to stay<br/>
with you or not.  Are the children getting similar messages ... you care and<br/>
maybe you do (or don&#39;t) want them there with you.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion (me being a complete novice to your situation) is to first<br/>
clear up this information for yourself (if you haven&#39;t already) and then<br/>
communicate more openly without laying too much responsibility or<br/>
expectation on the kids to understand you or do what you want.  Another<br/>
thing is when communicating more openly, listen to what they say (or seem to<br/>
be saying) and inquire even more so as to get a really clear picture and<br/>
understand even more about where they&#39;re coming from.  Their communication<br/>
may still end up being largely nonverbal.  That&#39;s what the kids are doing<br/>
when they lash out... communicating.<br/>
<br/>
Then even if they *do* end up going to live with their biological mom,<br/>
they&#39;ll have an even better basis to trust an adult who cares enough to<br/>
really listen even more than she already is.<br/>
<br/>
This situation sounds really difficult, but maybe check out Naomi Aldort&#39;s<br/>
Raising Our Children Raising Ourselves.  It may lend you some extra sanity<br/>
or give you some more good thoughts in the coming days.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a family tradition, incredibly helpful in rough waters and<br/>
incredibly refreshing in calm waters, we call &quot;Peace Circle.&quot; We sit<br/>
together and light a candle to begin. We go around the circle, taking turns<br/>
(using a speaking piece if necessary) finishing these statements about<br/>
Peace:<br/>
*Peace for me would be...<br/>
*I feel Peaceful when...<br/>
*I have manifested Peace by....<br/>
*I will manifest Peace by...<br/>
The last round, we often close with one word that shall represent the Peace<br/>
in Me for the week (or the day, depending on how often you gather... the<br/>
more intense the current circumstance, the more often we do Circle).  It<br/>
helps if it&#39;s set up as a Safe and Peaceful time for the whole family; in<br/>
the midst of angst one can call out &quot;I need Circle!&quot; and everyone will<br/>
gather to help create peace in that moment (and it doesn&#39;t have to be the<br/>
adult!)<br/>
<br/>
It has to be a safe place, without judgment (i.e. if a kid says &quot;Peace for<br/>
me would be mom getting hit by a truck&quot; the statement should be honored as a<br/>
Truth-in-the-moment and not a reflection of the person&#39;s morals) so that<br/>
dreaming of a Peaceful existence has a way of becoming a Reality.<br/>
