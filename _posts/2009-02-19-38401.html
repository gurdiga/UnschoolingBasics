<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329347122">Hi all, my name is Tara, mama to Zeb (9 y.o.) and wife to Justin. <br/>
We&#39;ve been unschooling for a little over two years and for the most <br/>
part are doing wonderful. Our challenge seems to mostly be between DH <br/>
and DS.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is not my son&#39;s bio-dad. We were married when he was <br/>
three. However, he has raised him as his son and Zeb thinks of him as <br/>
Dad. But DH comes from a much different background than I do. Seen <br/>
and not heard, abusive &quot;discipline&quot;, ridicule, etc. He sometimes has <br/>
a very difficult time not falling back on the things he&#39;s learned as <br/>
a kid.<br/>
<br/>
I know part of his problem comes from a place of jealousy. He&#39;s <br/>
stated in many different ways &quot;how good Zeb has it&quot; or how he would <br/>
never have gotten away with something or how he wishes he could stay <br/>
at home and play all day. :( DH is working very hard right now. Today <br/>
was his first day off in nearly a month; he&#39;s been working 12 hour <br/>
days and is very tired and can get cranky. Of course these reactions <br/>
aren&#39;t isolated to the times DH is on overtime, but it certainly <br/>
makes it worse.<br/>
<br/>
Today we were very excited he had a day off. DS had a golf lesson so <br/>
we went early so they could hit some balls for awhile together. DH <br/>
enjoyed watching Zeb&#39;s golf class for the first time and was so <br/>
impressed. Then it was rock climbing with some un- and homeschoolers. <br/>
Our first mistake was deciding we were still full from a late <br/>
breakfast and opting to skip lunch. I should have known after 3 hours <br/>
of rock climbing we&#39;d be famished and tired, which only exaggerated <br/>
things. Here&#39;s what happened:<br/>
<br/>
We were walking up to a local restaurant for an early dinner. DH was <br/>
teasing Zeb, ruffling his hair, etc. Zeb got frustrated when he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t stop and lashed out at him, hitting his arm away. From my <br/>
POV, I can totally relate to how Zeb was feeling - tired, cranky, <br/>
hungry, not wanting to be pestered. But DH got so mad! This kind of <br/>
thing happens alot. DH thinks he&#39;s being loving by teasing <br/>
excessively and DS gets angry and the two of them start fighting.<br/>
<br/>
And here I am in the middle. I can empathize with both of them - DH <br/>
trying his best, Zeb needing affection in other ways; DH deserving <br/>
not to be hit out of anger, Zeb deserving to have his feelings <br/>
respected. I would love DH to see that he is the adult and lend some <br/>
empathy and leeway (sp?) to Zeb but he feels I should back him up at <br/>
all costs. I&#39;m not comfortable backing him up when it really feels <br/>
like ganging up on the littlest member of the family. <br/>
<br/>
DH sat angrily thru dinner while me and Zeb let it go and tried to <br/>
enjoy ourselves. After dinner DH left quickly while we went to the <br/>
bathroom. I talked to Zeb a little about DH&#39;s POV and used our own <br/>
tiffs as an example - how sometimes when we are having a bad day and <br/>
get in a disagreement, if one of us is quick to make amends even <br/>
though still angry, we can both come to a place of forgiveness with <br/>
each other and ourselves. I asked him if he thought that would help <br/>
now. He thought about it for awhile and as we started to drive away, <br/>
tried to smooth things over with DH. DH ignored him. &gt;:(<br/>
<br/>
What can I do? I know I can&#39;t force DH to come to my understanding - <br/>
he doesn&#39;t have the benefit of time (or energy) to read blogs or <br/>
books or forums. And I don&#39;t feel right  doing nothing when he upsets <br/>
Zeb to the point of tears. I would love to find a way to support <br/>
their relationship without feeling as if I have to referee. I&#39;m just <br/>
not sure the best route to take here but I&#39;m sure there must be a <br/>
better way than being frustrated or justifying behaviors all the time.<br/>

<br/>
I have some of the same issues with my DH, who came from a similar background.  He <br/>
came from the anti-unschooling extreme, to say the least.  :(  To him, he had thing beat <br/>
into him (literally) that came from a dominating, aggressive, and controlling father.  <br/>
<br/>
When I started unschooling things really rubbed him the wrong way because what we <br/>
welcomed into our house (freedom to speak freely, respect for the other person, trust in <br/>
our kids, relaxation of a rigorous schedule, etc) was everything he was NOT given and <br/>
actually felt was &#39;wrong&#39; in comparison to what he was taught.  <br/>
<br/>
I gently introduced a list of &#39;basic rights for everyone in our family&#39; list.  I realized that <br/>
hubby really needed to be rehabilitated and shown a gentler way, because it just wasn&#39;t <br/>
natural to him.  the one thing I had going for me is that he knew how unhappy he was as a <br/>
kid growing up, and the last thing he wanted was to make his own child feel that way.  It <br/>
can be very delicate and sensitive to bring that up, but getting him to make a connection <br/>
to how he felt as a kid and how he may be making Z. feel may change his heart a little.  <br/>
<br/>
The following are some basic rights to which all parties to a relationship are entitled.<br/>
The right to good will from the other.<br/>
The right to emotional support.<br/>
The right to be heard by the other and to be responded to with courtesy.<br/>
The right to have your own view, even if your partner has a different view.<br/>
The right to have your feelings and experience acknowledged as real.<br/>
The right to receive a sincere apology for any jokes you may find offensive.<br/>
The right to clear and informative answers to questions that concern what is legitimately <br/>
your business.<br/>
The right to live free from accusation and blame.<br/>
The right to live free from criticism, judgement, put-downs or ridicule.<br/>
The right to have your work and your interests spoken of with respect.<br/>
The right to encouragement.<br/>
The right to live free from emotional and physical threat.<br/>
The right to live free from angry outburst and rage.<br/>

<br/>
I empathize with the &#39;teasing going too far&#39; situation, as my hubby is an aggressive type <br/>
teaser, meaning, he doesn&#39;t know when to stop if the other person is getting <br/>
annoyed/upset.  This also stems from his upbringing.  I just refer to the basic rights and <br/>
tell him clearly that I (my kids) are not enjoying it.  Before, he would say something like, <br/>
&quot;You have no sense of humor&quot; or &quot;why are you so uptight&quot;.  Now, since he&#39;s agreed to have <br/>
the basic rights be a part of our &#39;family rules&#39;, he apologizes if he crosses the line.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-534788799">DH made the same &#39;confession&#39; many years ago - DS was maybe 5 at the<br/>
time (he&#39;s 10 now). We had a long, long, late night talk brought about<br/>
by some event or situation. He finally said that he was &quot;jealous&quot; of how<br/>
good DS had it and that he felt guilty for being jealous. He needed<br/>
&quot;permission&quot; or something to allow himself to heal his own younger self<br/>
- to go out and get a $5 gadget that looked cool just because he wanted<br/>
it (and the funds were available), rather than having to &#39;earn&#39; it<br/>
somehow. I tried to encourage him to think about &quot;How would you have<br/>
felt if someone did this for you when you were a kid?&quot; and then go ahead<br/>
and allow yourself to do/have/be that. Rather than being<br/>
torn/grumpy/jealous/guilty over the differences, he started healing all<br/>
those &quot;I wish I had been able to...when I was a kid&quot; things instead of<br/>
expecting/demanding that DS somehow show gratitude for the freedoms he<br/>
had (which he&#39;s never known any different, we started walking in this<br/>
lifestyle before DS was 3, he doesn&#39;t know anything different but living<br/>
life free though he can see it and recognize it in other families we<br/>
know). It can be REALLY hard to admit that what he went through was not<br/>
somehow a &#39;good thing&#39;, that it hurt him, because it is generally one of<br/>
those &quot;I survived it and it made me stronger&quot; or &quot;Everyone does that&quot; or<br/>
whatever. But to ADMIT to one&#39;s self that No, when my dad/mom did that<br/>
it really hurt me and I felt &lt;whatever - hurt, belittled, angry, scared,<br/>
etc&gt;&quot; Then move on to &quot;Do you want your child, this child you obviously<br/>
love, to feel that way?&quot; Odds are the answer is no but coming to a place<br/>
where you can realize that it does NOT have to be that way can be hard,<br/>
seeing that there is another way to raise children and live as a family<br/>
and all calls into question everything you thought you knew.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the hair ruffling/teasing thing, we have made it clear from<br/>
the get go that Stop means Stop whether it&#39;s child-child, adult-adult,<br/>
or adult-child. Doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s tickling or silly joking (I<br/>
have a tendency toward silly puns that sometimes irritates DS) or<br/>
singing along to the CD on the car stereo, Stop means Stop. AFTER the<br/>
behavior has stopped, then there can be discussion of how to meet needs<br/>
(DH&#39;s desire to sing along with a favorite song; DS&#39; need for less sound<br/>
- he prefers totally instrumental music to vocals in general; my need to<br/>
NOT be stuck in the car between two grumpy people for 2 hours, etc).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958768650">I love the basic rights list. What a grand idea. <br/>
<br/>
Something that helped our family was the fact that my husband had<br/>
taken anger management before we married.. Hubby has children from a<br/>
previous relationship and I can see how his previous behavior hurt<br/>
that family. With the anger management course under his belt, he&#39;s a<br/>
much more stable person and able to react with consideration and<br/>
compassion. He&#39;s learned to respect the boundaries of others, the kids<br/>
included and his anger management techniques really benefit all of us<br/>
as we find inspiration in the way he handles situations. In the past,<br/>
he&#39;s credited that course with giving him a lot of tools and better<br/>
enabling him to stay centered and focused. <br/>
<br/>
He has little interest in the internet, so reading blogs and lists<br/>
like these are pretty out of the question. But, I do print out the<br/>
daily groove from enjoyparenting.com because I enjoy the reminders,<br/>
and thought he would also. I leave them on the counter so he can read<br/>
the quick little notes when he gets his coffee in the morning. He<br/>
enjoys them, and asked me to continue doing that for him. It&#39;s simple,<br/>
fast and offers a wide variety of food for thought as he goes about<br/>
his work day. <br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s quick jealousy streak at the very beginning of our<br/>
unschool journey faded rather rapidly.. I took notice of his feelings<br/>
and quickly embraced him as an integral part of this. I thought that<br/>
he didn&#39;t quite feel included, kind of left out and that left him<br/>
wishing his childhood had been different.. so he could have<br/>
experienced what this is like. But, he can experience it now. So, I<br/>
set out to find ways to get the boys together more with him.. in<br/>
environments where they could all learn new things, together. Then I<br/>
explained... that&#39;s what we do. That&#39;s unschool. You&#39;re doing it.<br/>
You&#39;re part of it.. and I let him know that he&#39;s an integral force in<br/>
making all of it possible. While he&#39;s at work, he&#39;s a part of it.<br/>
While he&#39;s mowing the grass, while he&#39;s working on his car, all of the<br/>
time.. he&#39;s part of it.. and I think that helped tremendously. Just<br/>
for him to realize and have me vocally acknowledge that he&#39;s so<br/>
important and that he&#39;s always involved and he doesn&#39;t have to look<br/>
back and wish, because he&#39;s doing it right now. It sounds simple, but<br/>
sometimes people need to hear it to bring them back to the present. I<br/>
think.</div>

Thank you for sharing those. If you do not mind I think I am going to use them to make up a basic family bill of rights for my family. My husband and I both need help moving further into unschooling. It has been very hard to let go of some of our pre-conceived notions on parenting. But we really need to. We have been reading a number of books from our public library and slowly incorporating things into our lives. I think your list might help us quite bit. We both come from rather strict backgrounds but want more for our children. Admittedly life has been rough for us all for a while and there is security in the status quo, at least for us. However, we have been talking at length about trying to ensure that our children feel secure and loved. <br/>

there is a sign your son expects dh to listen to him and respect his body.<br/>
And I always side with the human who has a right to not be touched.  Even in<br/>
love.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682625779">I wanted to comment on the step parenting aspect of this situation, because I think it may also play a part. My situation is similar to yours- my ex and I married when my dd, now 10, was 2. We went on to have three more kids. I see a difference in how he parents his biological kids compared to his adopted daughter. It seems like the main difference is that he missed that all important newborn bonding stage with her. It left him parenting more from the head, less from the heart. Also, he didn&#39;t have any kids of his own, so marrying me gave him his first opportunity to even think about parenthood- when her life was already two years started. It&#39;s hard to catch up. <br/>
<br/>
He has also had a problem with teasing when he feels stressed or angry. I have come to this issue with a protective attitude, because my dd is the child, the one who doesn&#39;t quite get what&#39;s happening, but knows it feels awful. That&#39;s the thing that is so duhumanizing about teasing- it looks like it&#39;s meant to be in fun, and my ex will say he&#39;s trying to have fun with her. But this nasty anger is lurking under the surface. I have always felt that it was important to step in and clear the air, to state for everyone that he&#39;s angry/tired/stressed and that what he&#39;s doing is not fun. I think it&#39;s important for my dd to have an adult advocate for her in that way.<br/>
<br/>
Over time it has helped a lot. He used to do it all the time. My dd, also, has learned to come out with a very strong- NO! Which is obviously a useful skill.<br/>
