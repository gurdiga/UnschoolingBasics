<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965779748">homeschooling family in need of blood - AB - with an IgA<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
kindly forward<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine&#39;s little boy is very sick right now and the family <br/>
is in need of prayers. LOTS of them.<br/>
<br/>
However, there is a more urgent need at this time. He needs a blood<br/>
transfusion and because of his illness and his blood type finding a<br/>
donor is a 1 in a million shot.<br/>
<br/>
He is AB - with an IgA (immunoglobulin) deficiency<br/>
<br/>
If you or anyone you know has this rare blood type and deficiency and<br/>
are willing to donate blood to Aaron, please contact me so I can get<br/>
you in touch with the family.<br/>

ETA -<br/>
<br/>
This is copied from my friend that is coordinating this effort,<br/>
<br/>
Here is what we need to work on that EACH person can do:<br/>
1) Find out if your local blood bank will ship blood out of state if<br/>
we find a donor.<br/>
<br/>
2) Email or call everyone we can to find a person with AB- blood and<br/>
get them tested for the deficeiny if they do not already know it. <br/>
When<br/>
you go in to donate blood, they have to type you. Ask prior to<br/>
starting to test for the IgA def. because it is not normally <br/>
something<br/>
they test for. If they KNOW they have AB- blood with a deficiency, <br/>
get<br/>
a hold of me ASAP (some people onsite have my number and can get a<br/>
hold of me in an instant.<br/>
)<br/>
3) Once we get the blood drive totally set up (Hosp PR, media, blood<br/>
bank, etc.), we will put out a call for anyone with AB- blood to get<br/>
tested for donation under Aaron&#39;s name.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much guys!<br/>
<br/>
Yes you can pass this on, the more people that see it the better. <br/>
Also<br/>
, if you or anyone can help please contact me, so I can get you in<br/>
tough with the family or the friend that is coordinating this effort.<br/>
