<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765462182">Ok, our son is 8.  He has been talking about making a robot for about<br/>
2yrs now.  His 5th Holloween I made an awesome (if I say so myself)<br/>
robot costume and while he LOVED it he wants to make the real deal!!  <br/>
<br/>
I have no idea where to even begin with this and now he has started<br/>
collecting little metal things he finds so he can make an &quot;Iron&quot; costume.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas would be very very welcome!!  This can&#39;t be expensive and<br/>
please keep in mind he is 8...of course I know that age is very<br/>
relative to his maturity and skill.  He has little sisters in the<br/>
house that are bound to want to help and play with this thing.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for any suggestions/ideas/links!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663644484">Look for books in your library or websites online that can help him<br/>
make basic robots for little cash expenditure.  If you have the money<br/>
for Mindstorms go for it.  But there are smaller projects (like bug<br/>
robots) you can do.  Just google and you will get lots of stuff!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179354613">I just joined and don&#39;t have time for an intro today, but I did want to<br/>
mention that Wired.com&#39;s GeekDad blog &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geekdad.com">http://www.geekdad.com</a>&gt;   is a<br/>
great source of info on robots for kids. Here&#39;s a post that focuses on<br/>
inexpensive robot kits for younger kids<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2008/09/7-cool-robots-f.html">http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2008/09/7-cool-robots-f.html</a>&gt;  . If you<br/>
look at the &quot;Robots&quot; category listed in the sidebar you&#39;ll find many<br/>
more. (Disclaimer: I am the token mom on this blog!)<br/>
<br/>
For a real easy, low tech robot experience, here&#39;s a link to a robot<br/>
that you can make out of a discarded toy motor<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.finkbuilt.com/blog/kids-art-bot/">http://www.finkbuilt.com/blog/kids-art-bot/</a>&gt;  , a paper cup, and a<br/>
couple of markers. And here are some fun links<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyonlinelinks.blogspot.com/2007/05/robots-january-2007-not-y&#92;">http://familyonlinelinks.blogspot.com/2007/05/robots-january-2007-not-y&#92;</a><br/>
et-updated.html&gt;   about robots from another of my many blogs.<br/>
<br/>
My 15 year old got a Mindstorms set last year as a birthday present.<br/>
IMHO it may be worth holding off until your child is older for that one.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
