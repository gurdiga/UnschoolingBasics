<div id="ygrps-yiv-525254114">My son is very interested in learning other languages and so we were <br/>
checking out some ways to do that through the computer and came across <br/>
this, we thought it was pretty cool and that maybe some of you might <br/>
want to check it out too. I remember someone else posting a while back <br/>
about their child being intererested in learning Japanese.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649732888">Unfortunately friendsabroad requires you to be 16 and older. Azure (the child who wants to learn Japanese) is only 13. But thanks.<br/>
