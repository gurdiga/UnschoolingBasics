<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117819617">Again at that age I remember thinking when are we going to start and it<br/>
occurred to me a year or so later that we had been &quot;doing it all along.&quot; To<br/>
me - my son just wasn&#39;t that interesting until he turned three. He didn&#39;t do<br/>
anything. He wasn&#39;t really into toys, he walked, he said words here and<br/>
there but beyond that he just watched. I realize now that it is because he<br/>
is a thinker. He doesn&#39;t always seem to even listen to you when you talk or<br/>
watch a show he has made a fuss to watch but a day, a week and sometimes<br/>
months later he says something that makes me go wow he was listening, he did<br/>
get it.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t have enough info to give feed back to say I want to do this other<br/>
then occasionally wanting to watch a video though he loved baths. We used to<br/>
take two or three baths a day just because he wanted to be in the water. It<br/>
was quite a shock when my DD was afraid of the water. Now she loves baths<br/>
too but not to the degree that my son did.<br/>

<br/>
Our problem definitely isn&#39;t a lack of communication. My daughter is a great<br/>
communicator, and has always let me know what&#39;s on her mind.  (Pardon me<br/>
while I brag on her a minute.) As a former deaf ed teacher I taught her<br/>
American Sign Language at a year, and by 18 months she had over 150 signs in<br/>
her vocabulary when she started talking at 20 months she just took off and<br/>
by the time she was 2 she sounded like a 3 yr old. She&#39;s been telling me<br/>
what she wants to eat, play, wear, etc. since she was 15 months.  My problem<br/>
is she usually has some idea of what she wants to play and it always has to<br/>
include me.  A mother can only play with play dough or pretend with stuffed<br/>
animals, for so long.  She doesn&#39;t want to play on her own so I&#39;m just<br/>
looking for some new alternatives that might captivate her.  I live in<br/>
Plano, TX just north of Dallas.  I try to check out some of the local sites<br/>
calendars to find things going on and enroll her every once in while in<br/>
recreation center classes for a change of pace, but sometimes I feel I might<br/>
be forcing her out of the house too much, so I was interested in what other<br/>
moms did all day at home.   She&#39;s not too much into music though once a week<br/>
or so she&#39;s willing to turn some on to dance to.  She does like art so we do<br/>
some painting, play dough work, and various gluing and coloring projects.<br/>
But as I think I said before or maybe in another post she constantly wants<br/>
me to play with her stuffed animals, and I&#39;m starting to really tire of it.<br/>

Most of the women there will have young kids, and not only will they <br/>

I remember when my oldest daughter was about three, she wanted to <br/>
play pretend with me ALL the time, and it was diffiuclt. Now she&#39;s <br/>
almost five and has a three year old sister, and the dynamic has <br/>
changed.<br/>
<br/>
What really really helped me was our walks. When the weather was <br/>
nice, we would walk to the library or Target about three times a <br/>
week.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Usually the story line is about a baby needing help in some way or another.<br/>
Occasionally it has to do with some kind of tea party or eating.  If she&#39;s<br/>
seem an episode  of Dora recently then some aspects might mirror the show<br/>
she&#39;s seen, like for a couple of weeks it was always the baby is lost and<br/>
needs to find it&#39;s mama like several of the Dora episodes.  Most of the time<br/>
there&#39;s nothing necessarily that I&#39;d rather be playing, I just get bored of<br/>
playing.  She wants to play for a good hour several times a day.<br/>
Occasionally the problem is that I&#39;d like to have  a minute to myself to<br/>
cook a meal, check e-mail, shower, etc. and she gets very upset if I don&#39;t<br/>
play with her.<br/>

Usually  the story line is about a baby needing help in some way or  another.<br/>
Occasionally it has to do with some kind of tea party or  eating.  If she&#39;s<br/>
seem an episode  of Dora recently then some  aspects might mirror the show<br/>
she&#39;s seen, like for a couple of weeks it was  always the baby is lost and<br/>
needs to find it&#39;s mama like several of the  Dora episodes.  Most of the time<br/>
there&#39;s nothing necessarily that I&#39;d  rather be playing, I just get bored of<br/>
playing.  She wants to play for  a good hour several times a day.<br/>
Occasionally the problem is that I&#39;d like  to have  a minute to myself to<br/>
cook a meal, check e-mail, shower, etc.  and she gets very upset if I don&#39;t<br/>
play with  her.<br/>

<br/>
*********************<br/>
Frankly, some adults are better at doing that kind of play with their kids  <br/>
than others. Many adults enjoy some of their children&#39;s stages of development  <br/>
more than others. And my experience is that only children need a bit more of  <br/>
that adult interaction (maybe mostly because a suitable playmate isn&#39;t  <br/>
conveniently sitting around the house.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;re already connecting up with other kids to play with. But  have <br/>
you thought of checking around for somebody like a kind pre- or young teen  <br/>
who likes small children and would like experience for future babysitting? You  <br/>
could be in the house doing some other things, and he or she will play with <br/>
your  daughter. <br/>

Good idea Kathryn, I have a teen neighbor that comes over once a week during<br/>
a sign language class I teach.  Maybe I can find some good homeschoolers to<br/>
help or else wait for the summer.  It seems the times I need help are during<br/>
school hours.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Basically I would preface the play with a time frame such as &quot;I need to do<br/>
this at 1:00&quot; or &quot;We can play for 15 minutes.&quot;  So she knew ahead of time<br/>
that I wasn&#39;t going to be there all day.  But I would let her bring whatever<br/>
her story involved (dolls, stuffed animals, Lego people, clothespins) with<br/>
her and continue telling me the story.  Or I would tell her to &quot;act it out&quot;<br/>
for me.  I wasn&#39;t having to be actively involved, but listening enough to<br/>
know the story line and be able to ask questions or interject an idea or<br/>
thought.  This worked for her because she was still with me and still<br/>
playing.  What I found most often was that she would continue this storyline<br/>
play for 5-10 minutes before she became interested in what I was doing.  I<br/>
found that it wasn&#39;t so much the play that she wanted but to be with me.<br/>
She found play to be the way to get me in her world.  Once I was in her<br/>
world, we could expand that world to include my interests as well.<br/>
<br/>
Now it seems like I am doing things in reverse.  My kids love playing on the<br/>
Playstation.  It totally is not something I even remotely would say excel<br/>
at!  (Let&#39;s face it, I was a teen when Pacman and Atari came out and I can&#39;t<br/>
even play Pong! LOL!)  But now I find myself sitting with a bowl of popcorn<br/>
trying to understand Kingdom Hearts (and they are right now play KH2) and<br/>
trying to get into their world.  I understand their music, movies, dress,<br/>
lingo, but the video games escape me.  Of course they find it all hilarious<br/>
when I play and die and play again and die and fall off cliffs and shoot the<br/>
good guy.<br/>

(probably you&#39;re looking for a girl, but don&#39;t discount boys, some really enjoy that <br/>

unschooling groups, neighbors. (And if you&#39;re in Lake County IL, email me, I&#39;ve got <br/>
