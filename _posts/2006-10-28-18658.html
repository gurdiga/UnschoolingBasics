Who knows what I meant to write there but it should have looked more like <br/>
&quot;only they can determine what amount of personal time and attention is <br/>
enough.&quot;<br/>

My friend is going through this with her daughter.   My friends very words <br/>
were &quot;She&#39;s so needy&quot;  and yet instead of trying to meet those needs she <br/>
went the other way.  To &quot;fix&quot; her daughter&#39;s neediness she tried to separate <br/>
from her daughter more.<br/>
<br/>
If our kids were hungry we wouldn&#39;t say the answer to that is to deny food. <br/>
If our kids were tired we wouldn&#39;t say the answer was to deny them a place <br/>
to sleep.   When a person has a need the only way to help them is to help <br/>
them fill the need.<br/>

When Cameron was in school, the school sponsored a parenting class. <br/>
With a psychiatrist. I knew him. We&#39;d gone to school together. He&#39;s a <br/>
3-5 years younger than I am. Shaw Evans.<br/>
<br/>
ANyway, he was leading this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
He told a story of an eight year old girl whose parents had recently <br/>
divorced. She was in school all day and in after-school care every <br/>
afternoon until 5:00 when someone would pick her up from school. She <br/>
had soccer and dance classes in the evenings.<br/>
<br/>
Mom worked all day and was tired at night.  So tired that they rarely <br/>
cooked at home---fast food or sandwiches. Dad was gone---she saw him <br/>
one weekend each month.<br/>
<br/>
The child desperately wanted to sleep with her mom at night. Mom made <br/>
her go to bed in her room. When the child started to come into the <br/>
mom&#39;s room in the middle of the night, the psychiatrist&#39;s suggestion <br/>
was to LOCK THE CHILD IN HER ROOM AT BEDTIME!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I started freaking out. I was hyper-ventilating. I kept saying to Ben, <br/>
&quot;We need to go we need to go now I need to go we have to leave now I <br/>
need to go! Nownownow!&quot; We walked out.<br/>
<br/>
Here was a LITTLE girl. Little! Eight!. Her dad had moved out. Her mom <br/>
worked all day. Child was engaged with everyone *except* a parent all <br/>
day. When she finally got home, she *needed* to connect with mom. Mom <br/>
simply wanted time to herself. Time to be alone. She *was* a single <br/>
mom, afterall and needed time to regroup every day.<br/>
<br/>
So they locked the little girl in her room every night. The child <br/>
curled in a ball at the door of her room and cried herself to sleep <br/>
every night for weeks.<br/>
<br/>
After *only* a month, the child quit crying and started sleeping in her <br/>
bed. Never bothered the mom at night again. Success story!<br/>
<br/>
In this case, the child&#39;s neediness didn&#39;t outweigh the adult&#39;s <br/>
neediness. Even though the adult had many more years of ecperience. I&#39;m <br/>
guessing that the trust lost will come back to bite this mom HARD in <br/>
the butt. Poor little girl.<br/>
