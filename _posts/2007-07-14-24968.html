 </span></blockquote>Yes, this is why its important to me, personally, to focus on needs <br/>
being important - I tend to be a &quot;fixer&quot;. So thinking about finding <br/>
win/win solutions takes me right back to more goal-oriented problem <br/>
solving - if I&#39;m thinking &quot;must find win/win solution&quot; I&#39;m more <br/>
likely to skip the process and go right to &quot;okay, you guys, this is <br/>
what I&#39;ve decided will work for everyone&quot;. Oops. If I can step away <br/>
from my own desire to find a solution, I&#39;m a lot more open to <br/>
possibilities. <br/>
