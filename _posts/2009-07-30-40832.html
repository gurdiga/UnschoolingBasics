<div id="ygrps-yiv-151249178">It looks like I will be getting a job and going back to work.  And, that the kids will be going back to school.  I really wish I didn&#39;t have to do this, but hubby&#39;s business is struggling.  At this point, he wants to continue working on his business and we need the stability of me having a full time job.  I want the homeschooling/un-schooling more than he does.  So does my 8-year-old son.  My daughter misses school somewhat and is okay with going back but was also ready to keep trying homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I am doing my best at staying present.  After all, I don&#39;t have the job yet!  <br/>
<br/>
But, un-schooling has provided some time for family healing.  And, I want to keep that healing going.  And, hope I can through this next stage in our family&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
Please wish me well and encourage me to be patient and present.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-114525452">I wish you well.  Good luck in all your adventures..<br/>
<br/>
Just don&#39;t believe that you &#39;can&#39;t&#39; unschool because you have to return to work.  It can be done.  I&#39;ve been doing it since my son was 8.<br/>
<br/>
It takes some creativity, but it can be done.  Either way, as long as you are there for your kids, all should work out.<br/>
<br/>
God bless.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another full-time working mama here. Dh and I work around each other&#39;s schedules to make it work and occasionally have an older sibling babysit or maybe a friend. Rare, but it does happen.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a choice. It can be done in many situations if people will be creative and dedicated. This list is here to help people unschool and many of us can share ideas and information about how to go about it in unusual situations.<br/>

I am an unschooling dad that is building a business and it is struggling. I am able to work from home a make my own schedule. I fix peoples computers. I am able to take my youngest dd with me for the most part. People have been very receptive to seeing me with my daughter. In this world of children staying at home with their parents I think it is time for the business world to accept parents bringing their children to work. Yes I have heard of &quot;bring your daughter to work day&quot; but that is only one day. I know that their are issues that arise from this but I think we need to take a quantum leap as a society.<br/>
-getting off of soapbox-<br/>
What type of work are looking to do? Is there a chance that you can start your own business? Is your dh&#39;s business one that you could be part of? I hope that you can find something that allows you to give you and your family what you desire and deserve.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my son was young(2-3)- I repaired vintage blue jeans for a guy who <br/>
had a business reselling the blue jeans overseas. I did this with my son <br/>
in the house. It wasn&#39;t much money, but it made a difference as we <br/>
needed very little when the kids were young. We lived in a school bus <br/>
for a few months, at another time traded labor for rent on a tiny cabin. <br/>
We owned a really cheap property with a mobile home on it with an <br/>
addition that was really kind of gross in retrospect. All this allowed <br/>
us to work less and me to stay home with the kids. We bought very <br/>
little, and what we did buy was used. We did some caretaking - which <br/>
provided &quot;free&quot; housing.<br/>
<br/>
Now that they are older I work free-lance part time for my dad&#39;s <br/>
business as a graphic designer, which is what I went to school for. I <br/>
work in the morning when they are sleeping, or at night after dinner. It <br/>
is mostly pretty workable, though since it is an unpredictable number of <br/>
hours sometimes it is too much. We struggle a bit at those times but it <br/>
is much better than many other options. I am at home with the kids and <br/>
can stop and help them when they need something. I have been doing this <br/>
since they were 8 and 12- they are 12 and 16 now. It helps pay the bills <br/>
quite often and allows us to afford extras that the kids really appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
We never technically were in what most people would consider a position <br/>
to be able to afford to unschool our kids. However since it was the most <br/>
important thing to us- we just did it and trusted that it would all work <br/>
out some way or another. And it has. It is WAY easier now for me to earn <br/>
now that they are older, which is good, because they need me a little <br/>
less and things that money can buy a little more.<br/>

Ooooooohh!!  This reminded me of a story my spouse came home with the other day!  He had stopped in a new pet shop to pick up feeder rats for his pet snakes.  While looking around the new store, a little girl around 9yo, popped up and asked if she could be of assistance.  Since my spouse is a little hard of hearing, he asked her to repeat herself.  At that he said she put on her sales person persona and stood tall and went into the most adorable sales pitch or sales service mode.  He was so impressed that he smiled and stated, &quot;You must be homeschooled!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lol, this threw her off a bit, but it turns out that yes, she not only is homeschooled, but unschooled! <br/>
<br/>
Hehe...so maybe, we will start seeing more children in businesses. <br/>
