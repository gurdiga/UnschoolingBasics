<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418707342">Hi: I haven&#39;t been following this thread, but this email jumped out at me.<br/>
My dd&#39;s, 8 and 10 are very sensitive to scary and violent movies. I agree<br/>
Disney has some of the worst offenders. We watched a movie yesterday that<br/>
was rated PG (unusual for us) called Mad Hot Ballroom, and it was wonderful.<br/>
It&#39;s a documentary about a ballroom competition held in NYC for public<br/>
school 5th graders. I can&#39;t figure out how this movies was rated PG and the<br/>
Lion King is G.  Best wishes, Cara B<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; There are plenty of movies that aren&#39;t scary AND aren&#39;t Disney! &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many, many times we thought that the Disney movies were the scariest ones out<br/>
&gt; there. A parent ALWAYS dies or leaves in order to create dramatic tension in<br/>
&gt; their live action movies. In their animated stuff the violence and intensity<br/>
&gt; can really go over the top. My kids still haven&#39;t seen Bambi. Neither one<br/>
&gt; wanted amovie that leads up to the beloved mother dying.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s why it&#39;s a good idea to examine movies and shows as they come up. The<br/>
&gt; name Disney or an animated presentation does not guarantee a happy movie. In<br/>
&gt; that same vein, an adult theme or monster premise is not automatically too<br/>
&gt; intense in every situation. It depends on the child, the situation, the<br/>
&gt; parents, and the movie. </span></blockquote></div>

You can type a movie title into:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.filmratings.com">http://www.filmratings.com</a><br/>
<br/>
and it will tell you why it was given the rating it has.<br/>
<br/>
Mad Hot Ballroom says: Rated PG for some thematic elements.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true, but I have the feeling that animated  <br/>
images and themes are rated softer than if those same images and  <br/>
themes were live action.<br/>
