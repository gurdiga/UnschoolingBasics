<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927413818">Hi, Karen!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say it&#39;s all always smooth sailing for us with dr/dentist, but I can<br/>
identify two issues that helped my daughter a lot.  #1 she had such a hard<br/>
time with our pediatrician who is so gentle and fabulous and I could never<br/>
understand it until the one day he wasn&#39;t in and on a whim I asked to see a<br/>
female doctor.  DIFFERENT CHILD!  It was a male/female issue - I talked to<br/>
him and he helped us switch to a female doctor at the same office and her<br/>
visits have been fearless ever since.  With the dentist, I waited past when<br/>
everyone said I should, till my daughter showed signs of readiness (she was<br/>
almost 4), and what got her interested was watching Caillou and Barney<br/>
Dentist episodes, reading a Barney story about a little girl going to the<br/>
dentist, and another key was finding a very child-friendly dentist where<br/>
they are fabulous with kids and she gets to &quot;hold Mr. Thirsty&quot; during the<br/>
cleanings and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
We have also read Pooh books about going to the Dr. and so forth and those<br/>
seem to help.  My daughter bringing her own doctor&#39;s kit and looking in the<br/>
pediatricians ears with her otoscope while he looked in hers also helped<br/>
when she was younger.<br/>

Hi...we are an unschooling family from Mass.  My dd is 6 and ds is 4.  What<br/>
do you do when your kids give you a difficult time about visiting the<br/>
dr/dentist.  Recently, they went for their well visit and refused to let the<br/>
dr near them.  I was alright w/it and we left. They have been healthy and<br/>
are not used to going to the office.  I wasnt going to threaten or force<br/>
them.  We had the same problem at the dentist, but, I think that will be<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924985129">I spent a lot of time preparing my son for his 3 yr check up. We <br/>
talked about it, acted it out with his doctor&#39;s kit, read about it, <br/>
talked when kids on tv went to the doctor, etc. We planned to go out <br/>
for ice cream afterwards, not as a reward for good behavior, but just <br/>
a nice outing to balance out the day.<br/>
<br/>
But I didn&#39;t realize they were going to take his blood pressure. <br/>
<br/>
Everything *else* went very smoothly. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Karen, my little one is 6 and hasn&#39;t yet seen the<br/>
dentist.  She saw the naturopath the only one time she<br/>
was sick, and went along with it just fine as she was<br/>
sick and wanted some help.  Are you sure &quot;well child&quot;<br/>
check-ups are necessary when your child is well?<br/>
<br/>
We do see a chiropractor twice a week, who my little<br/>
one LOVES, BUT she doesn&#39;t always like to be adjusted.<br/>
 They let me make an appt. for her, and then after I&#39;m<br/>
done with my adjuestment she decides if she wants to<br/>
be adjusted that day or not.  She does about 1/3 of<br/>
the time.  (The reason we go so often is because my 11<br/>
yo is seeing him for her seizures--AND no seizures for<br/>
6 months--YAH!)<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
With our second son, we just quit with the well-child visits. Why  take a <br/>
perfectly well child to a place that could be literally  crawling with germs in <br/>
the first place?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
When they are truly sick, they have no qualms about going to the doctor.  <br/>
They WANT to feel better and ask that I make an appointment. But I can count the  <br/>
number of times they&#39;ve each been sick enough to visit the doctor on one  <br/>
hand!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
The dentist has never been a problem either. They both went with me and  <br/>
watched me get my teeth cleaned. The hygenist spoke to them about what she was  <br/>
doing and let them poke an instrument or two in my mouth! &lt;G&gt; Duncan  loved  <br/>
those little mirrors! They were both eager to have their first  appointements <br/>
(which were VERY gentle and SHORT!). Neither have had a cavity;  Cameron had one <br/>
tooth pulled.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
YOUR attitude counts! Be *happy* about having to go. Don&#39;t make it out to  be <br/>
a scary place in words or body language.<br/>
