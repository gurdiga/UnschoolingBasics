<div id="ygrps-yiv-556063985">This evening I came home.  I took a breath in the car and made the intention<br/>
to be peaceful.  And then I walked in the door..and I had to fight to hold<br/>
on to the peace (right there is an oxymoron, huh?).  I was met with glee by<br/>
my children who missed me during the day.  My husband was playing a computer<br/>
game. I changed my clothes and proceeded to finish cleaning up the living<br/>
room (Khalid and Khidar had decided to &quot;cook&quot; and got raw meat and<br/>
condiments out of the refrigerator and smeared it on our sofa and carpet).<br/>
Then there were choruses of &quot;what&#39;s for dinner?&quot;  And that overwhelmed<br/>
feeling started to come over me.  Khalid and Khidar started arguing over<br/>
toys, there was crying involved and hitting.  I tried to comfort one and the<br/>
other would come over which would agitate the &quot;victim&quot;.  There was &quot;I want<br/>
something to drink&quot; &quot;can I help cook?&quot;  Just voices everywhere.  Dakari did<br/>
help me cook, as did Safiya - I&#39;m working on saying &quot;yes&quot; more often.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just want to be able to stay centered and not get swept away in the<br/>
natural chaos that comes along with having young children.  I want to stop<br/>
gritting my teeth and wishing for a quiet spot away from everyone.  I want<br/>
to see the world and my children differently - even if my husband does not.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What can/should I do?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
be at peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968757622">First {{HUGS}} I know the feeling somewhat, there&#39;s just DH and one DS,<br/>
but there have been times when I don&#39;t even have my jacket off and I&#39;m<br/>
hit with &quot;Daddy did...&quot; &quot;Yeah, but he did...&quot; and there&#39;s still lunch<br/>
stuff on the table and dinner&#39;s not started and ... <br/>
<br/>
One of my &quot;best&quot; tactics for those moments when I feel that relaxing<br/>
breath just draining away is &quot;I&#39;ve gotta go to the bathroom - in<br/>
private&quot; and I go sit in the bathroom for 2 minutes (my guys are used to<br/>
Mommy needing to go potty as soon as she gets home now cause I usually<br/>
DO have to go at that point). I can regroup and breathe again. I can let<br/>
all the &quot;why didn&#39;t he ...!?&quot; and &quot;why doesn&#39;t he...?&quot; thought swirl<br/>
around and then down the toilet with the rest of the &#39;stuff&#39;. Then I go<br/>
out, start quietly clearing the table, and so on. By then, usually, DH<br/>
has started dinner (often his sense of the timing of when things need to<br/>
get started is different than mine, not wrong just different, and since<br/>
he&#39;s the chief chef... Often he waits until I pull in so that whatever<br/>
it is will be fresh and hot for me instead of sitting on the stove).<br/>
And, by then, DS is wanting a hug and asking how my day was. THEN we can<br/>
deal with whatever else is needed.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that might be important in what you&#39;ve described is<br/>
that the kids might be needing to eat sooner than when you get home. Are<br/>
there things they can get themselves that will give them a little boost<br/>
in the late afternoon? Stuff like trail mix (we make our own with nuts,<br/>
dried fruit, chocolate bits, etc) or pre-sliced chunks of cheese or<br/>
whatever can really help that pre-dinner low and keep everyone stable.<br/>
Maybe even consider a quick phone call &quot;Hi guys, I&#39;m about to head out<br/>
from work. I left some cheese in the blue container in the fridge for<br/>
you guys to snack on until dinner. And, Hon, can you fill the big pot on<br/>
the stove with water and set it to boil? That way I can toss in the<br/>
pasta when I get home and it&#39;ll be quick. Thanks&quot; Depending on your<br/>
family, maybe prepare &quot;lunch boxes&quot; (snack packs) for each child before<br/>
leaving for work and toss in a little personal note or something for<br/>
each. That way each of them has their own access to foods for the day<br/>
plus a little reminder of Mommy to hold onto. <br/>
<br/>
And, something that&#39;s easier for me (since I&#39;ve only got one kid and one<br/>
of me) is to spend 5 minutes right off focused on that one person. I&#39;m<br/>
not sure how you&#39;d arrange it with a bunch of kids - maybe give each one<br/>
a &#39;day&#39; (with 4 kids that means that hubby gets a day to himself too)<br/>
and the first 5 minutes you&#39;re home &#39;belong&#39; to that one, then the<br/>
others in some order (height, age, alphabetically, by birth month, day,<br/>
whatever works) each get 5 minutes. Knowing that they&#39;ll each get a<br/>
chunk of your undivided attention might (or might not) help with the<br/>
immediate clamor of all of them at once looking for some face time with<br/>
Mom. That&#39;d be something to sit and discuss - &quot;Hey guys, when I get home<br/>
from work I want to talk to ALL of you but I can&#39;t talk to all of you at<br/>
the same time. How do you propose we arrange things so that you all get<br/>
to talk to me without us all getting tangled up?&quot; (okay that&#39;s kind of a<br/>
verbose way to say it but it gives the sense of it). I know that when I<br/>
was a kid (my parents didn&#39;t unschool or gently parent in the sense of<br/>
things nowadays but it was pretty close), we knew that when Daddy got<br/>
home, #1 was he&#39;d go find mom and give her a kiss. Then he&#39;d go up and<br/>
get out of his suit and tie and get comfortable. While he was changing,<br/>
anyone who wanted/needed to chat could go up and chat with him. Or, we<br/>
could wait (if there was nothing earth shattering going on) until he<br/>
came back down (there were 3 of us kids, when I was 10, my brother was 8<br/>
and my sister was 5 to give you an idea of age ranges). Just knowing<br/>
that we&#39;d have a space to be heard if/when we needed it took some of the<br/>
urgency out of having to get it in right away. There was space and we<br/>
knew that even when we were fairly little.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I might even consider if I was in your situation, going ahead and<br/>
doing once a week type cooking on the weekend and then making dinner<br/>
would consist of reheating the lasagna, soup, whatever - basically,<br/>
reduce the amount of your time required to get dinner prepared so that<br/>
you have more space to spend with the family during the week. And/or get<br/>
a slow cooker that you can set up in the morning and leave until you get<br/>
home, again minimizing the dinner hour crush.<br/>

<br/>
As the at-home-parent I can say that this is SO helpful for us!  If <br/>
we know that dh is on his way home we can &quot;get ready&quot; and make <br/>
adjustments as needed so as to be ready to welcome him when he comes <br/>
in.  Dh works very long hours and we never know when he might be <br/>
coming so it&#39;s really helpful if he lets us know.  We usually <br/>
scramble around a bit to pick up things we&#39;re finished with, I might <br/>
make him some dinner, etc....  Mostly it&#39;s just a heads up that we <br/>
are going to be transitioning into including him -- sort of like <br/>
telling a kid that we&#39;ll be leaving in 10 minutes instead of <br/>
springing it on him all of a sudden and then wondering why he is <br/>
resistant.  When dh does not give us a heads up it can be really <br/>
tough to make the transition into including him and making him feel <br/>
welcome.  We usually DO need some time to finish up doing what we&#39;re <br/>
doing and transition our expectations before we can give him our <br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
Highly recommend and appreciate the &quot;heads up&quot; phone call!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-605908759">Maisha,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve done two broad categories of stuff;  external and internal (I guess I<br/>
should clarify  ;-) ).<br/>
<br/>
Externally, it&#39;s much like what&#39;s been suggested -- some pre-planning, like<br/>
the snacks for kids to munch on, pre-preparing meals, or other of what I<br/>
call &quot;guerrilla love-fare&quot;.  Being sneaky on behalf of your family, you<br/>
might say.  Unconventional tactics used to keep the peace and further mutual<br/>
respect and harmony.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  I&#39;ve found that simply announcing &quot;SUPPER!&quot; can be a great way to<br/>
keep everyone away from the supper table.  Walking in with a bowl of egg<br/>
salad and crackers, sitting down and just eating, well, they look over and<br/>
see what I&#39;m doing and join in.<br/>
Example:  We had a sleepover last Tuesday, and two of our visitors got into<br/>
a tug-of-war match over a toy.  I could hear them getting more and more<br/>
upset from the other room.  Finally, I just ran into the room stomping my<br/>
feet on the floor all the way (pier-and-beam house), and yelled,<br/>
&quot;SASQUATCH!&quot;  They just looked up at me like I was crazy (DW says I am) and<br/>
started laughing.  (NOTE:  Normally, I&#39;d try to work it out between them,<br/>
but they weren&#39;t in a mental space for it as they were tired and hungry and<br/>
DW was getting food as quickly as possible.)  For us it&#39;s a combination of<br/>
strategic pre-planning combined with a playful attitude and a slightly<br/>
off-center viewpoint.<br/>
<br/>
On the finding the meat smeared all over the couch, well,...that&#39;s where the<br/>
internal stuff comes in a lot more.  For us, this involves how we respond to<br/>
the big surprise unknowns.  For example, DW walked in to find sugar all over<br/>
our living room.  ALL OVER the room, the furniture, etc. (GOOD NEWS:<br/>
hardwood floors.)  I think there was some spilled water in there, too, but<br/>
it&#39;s hard to recall b/c my memories are a bit red-tinted.  Needless to say,<br/>
we didn&#39;t do too well that day as parents.  But what it brought out is that<br/>
our default reaction to many &quot;unpleasant surprises&quot; was one of anger and<br/>
personal offense.  As if they deliberately did something to try to make us<br/>
feel bad.<br/>
<br/>
That had to change, that initial  reaction.  We&#39;ve tried to supplant it with<br/>
sincerely asking questions, like, &quot;Remember, they are more than their<br/>
behavior, so:  why would they do something like this? Are they angry?  Are<br/>
they simply being curious and experimenting?  What&#39;s the motivation behind<br/>
this action?  And further, if it needs helping, what can I do to help it?&quot;<br/>
This is a change we wanted to see in ourselves, but we also had to justify<br/>
it to our reptile brains.  The following helped us with that:  Children are<br/>
innately curious.  They bond with their parents naturally and WANT to bond<br/>
with us.  They&#39;re not mean or malicious.  Children are more than their<br/>
behavior.  The behavior they display is done for a reason, an understandable<br/>
one.  Sometims we must play detective to try to find it out, and sometimes<br/>
we have to just trust that the reason is valid, even if we don&#39;t know what<br/>
it is (and never will).  The things that matter to them (e.g. having the<br/>
pink sippy cup with the purple lid) are just as important to them as paying<br/>
the bills on time are to me.  Respect that.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that convinces me when I&#39;m calm and here at work away from the kids.<br/>
But what got us (and still helps get us) there emotionally?  What dampens<br/>
that spike of strong emotion?  As they say, there is no substitute for<br/>
experience...<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it takes forcing myself to ask those questions listed above<br/>
instead of being Captain Justice.  Example:  My dd2 hit a friend in our<br/>
house.  Instead of going ballistic on her (&quot;I AM THE LAW!&quot;), I started<br/>
asking her questions.  I tried being as non-confrontational as possible, and<br/>
as caring as I could.  Turns out that the friend had hit dd2&#39;s sister, dd1,<br/>
and dd2 was protecting her.  dd1 said they were just playing, but dd2 didn&#39;t<br/>
see it that way.<br/>
<br/>
Now here&#39;s the good bit:  I got a peek into her psyche that I otherwise<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have gotten.  This is when I realized how loyal dd2 is.  This added<br/>
huge amounts of motivation for me to keep asking questions and being<br/>
respectful.  Not only does it treat them respectfully and provide them with<br/>
a safer environment, and help them grow emotionally, but we now have even<br/>
more knowledge about her so that our future responses are even MORE<br/>
appropriate and respectful.  And what parent doesn&#39;t want to know their<br/>
children?<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the day, sometimes we re-live the day&#39;s tough situations the<br/>
way we wished we had done it, rather than how we actually did. Some days we<br/>
don&#39;t know how we wanted to do it and we have to puzzle it out.  A bit of<br/>
mental practicing and re-living.  And more often lately we&#39;ve also been<br/>
sharing our successes with each other.  Proof for each other from the front<br/>
lines that we&#39;re getting better.<br/>
<br/>
I guess to summarize, that &quot;quiet spot&quot; in the middle of the chaos you&#39;re<br/>
asking about we seem to have found a bit of a quiet spot (sometimes) within<br/>
the maelstrom by changing ourselves.  I think half of the chaos is really in<br/>
my own mind and the chaos of the house just exacerbates it.  If I can stop<br/>
taking offense and realize that when my kids pester me constantly, or<br/>
&quot;experiment&quot; with the markers on the computer screen, they&#39;re being Natural<br/>
Kids.  They love me, and they want to explore their world.  (&quot;Hey, who wants<br/>
to spray with the spray bottle?&quot; &quot;MEEEE!&quot;  &quot;MEEEE!&quot;  &quot;Can I wipe with the<br/>
towels?&quot;)  I think they start with so much love to give.  I just have to<br/>
remember that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/SOAPBOX_RAMBLE&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is definitely true in my case. I tend to come home from work in <br/>
one of two frames of mind. Neither is especially conducive to sliding <br/>
back into family life.<br/>
<br/>
1. Revved up. If I&#39;ve had a productive day, the high of that can <br/>
carry me home. I have so much energy that I get psyched up to <br/>
continue to be productive at home. &quot;I can do X, and I can do Y, <br/>
and...&quot; The part of that I don&#39;t &quot;think out loud&quot; is a certain <br/>
expectation that my energy will be both contagious and retroactive, <br/>
like I can infuse my family&#39;s entire day with the same &quot;Getting <br/>
Things Done&quot; mentality. And then I walk in the house and see the <br/>
happy remains (&quot;MESS!&quot; my brain screams) of a day spent in a whole <br/>
other, much more important kind of productivity. And the family is <br/>
winding *down*, starting to think about quieter times or their <br/>
favorite TV shows. Slowing myself down, even long enough for a little <br/>
snuggly catchup time, is a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
2. Tired and discouraged. I didn&#39;t get enough done. There were too <br/>
many piddly details or large obstacles or extra-large egos thrown in <br/>
my way. I&#39;ve been slogging uphill through molasses all day. And I <br/>
walk in the door and it all seems MORE OF THE SAME. Nobody helps me. <br/>
Everybody makes my life more difficult than it needs to be. Blah blah <br/>
blah. Whine whine whine.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll notice that both of these have their feet in *my high <br/>
expectations for myself*. And the thing that calms me most is <br/>
reassuring myself that I did *enough*. If I can walk through the <br/>
front door with some acceptance of my self, it&#39;s much easier to <br/>
accept -- and appreciate -- what I find inside.<br/>
<br/>
I once read a little anecdote, either in Mothering or Reader&#39;s <br/>
Digest -- how&#39;s that for variety, lol -- about a man who would come <br/>
home and mime hanging his work day (or maybe his work self) on the <br/>
tree outside. I often think of that as I&#39;m walking up the front walk.<br/>
<br/>
Ronnie<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I second the suggestion to call ahead, especially if your <br/>
arrival time varies from day to day. My family *understands* that <br/>
coming home to mess is hard, and some days they give me the gift of <br/>
tidying up. Even if this only happens once in a while, the warmth of <br/>
the gift can carry me through more difficult days.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-566914344">-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
About a month ago I was in a similar place. Always looking for a<br/>
quiet place (even if only mentally). Thoughts like &quot;Leave me alone&quot;<br/>
and &quot;Why can&#39;t I just have a moments peace&quot; came to mind. That was<br/>
not the place I wanted to be in. Intellectually, I knew what I needed<br/>
to do, where I wanted to be. I just couldn&#39;t seem to get there.<br/>
I would have a good dose of undivided time and connection with my<br/>
children, then would once again feel depleted, and off in search of<br/>
the quiet place. It was the opposite direction of where I needed to<br/>
be going though. I knew that. But, how could I start connecting with<br/>
the kids in a way that didn&#39;t feel obligatory?<br/>
<br/>
Then I remembered this song from a few years ago. I got up and<br/>
watched the YouTube video repeatedly one night. I cried and cried<br/>
knowing I could be giving so much more than I was. I woke up the next<br/>
morning with such a sense of renewal. I&#39;ve kept it ever since. If I<br/>
thought I felt it start slipping away, I would listen to the song<br/>
again, or sing it to myself. It would remind me again of where the<br/>
answers are. It always takes me back to what is important. Maybe you<br/>
could listen to it on your way home from work. Maybe this isn&#39;t the<br/>
song for you, but some other song, or perhaps a poem will touch you<br/>
in the same way.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I recently found something similar to this. I was laying alone in my bed<br/>
after having told my dh to &quot;go away&quot; because I was upset with him. I really<br/>
didn&#39;t want him to &quot;go away&quot;, but he did ask I asked, not as I thought. Go<br/>
figure, lol! Anyway, I got to thinking about how I needed alone time. Except<br/>
I knew that really wasn&#39;t the case. I like alone time, but it doesn&#39;t always<br/>
make me feel better.<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;song&quot; is actually a character in a series of books by Peirs Anthony. The<br/>
Mode Series &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.piers-anthony.com/mode.html">http://www.piers-anthony.com/mode.html</a>&gt;, it is called. There is<br/>
a character, from a different universe who can &quot;draw in&quot; emotion from<br/>
others, multiply it, and send it out to the multitudes. So, I am working on<br/>
becoming something like that. &quot;Drawing in&quot; the chaos (or whatever), like<br/>
drinking it up, letting it fuel me and fill me up (after all, my kids will<br/>
only be this age for this moment) so that I will be able to give more to my<br/>
family. My goal is that eventually, nothing will &quot;deplete&quot; me. That is not<br/>
