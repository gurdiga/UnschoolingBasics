In my opinion, this is very off topic.<br/>
Try googling for  it.<br/>

I don&#39;t see not vaccinating as off topic to  unschooling since it is doing <br/>
something respectful toward your child  and (hopefully) allowing them to make <br/>
their decision when they are ready  as to whether they want to do the vaccines <br/>
or not. My 11 year old is  already reading about pros and cons (so far he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to) but I  definitely want him to make that decision for himself. same <br/>
with not  circumcising. if my boys want their penis cut they can decide that <br/>
once  they are able to understand and decide. <br/>

I agree. I wouldn&#39;t want the list to get off on a big vax/no vax<br/>
debate because that really has nothing to do with unschooling, but we<br/>
CAN discuss it as it relates to unschooling and how we can respect our<br/>
children&#39;s wishes while trying to deal with all the information out there.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone wanting information that is pro/con about vaccinations, we<br/>
can share links since that IS getting a bit off topic for the list.<br/>
<br/>
If a topic is too far from unschooling, sharing links is ok (in small<br/>
doses).<br/>

I think the philosophy behind allowing a child to choose IS on topic, but the pros and cons of  vaxes is better suited to a vax list.<br/>
That is what I was responding to, a request for info on the pros and cons of vaccinations.<br/>
But then, like I said, it&#39;s only my opinion, I can always delete.<br/>
