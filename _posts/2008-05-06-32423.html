<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646642911">We&#39;ve been deschooling since the end of March and I was wondering when<br/>
my dude would show interest in something other than video games.<br/>
<br/>
Two days ago, we went to the store to buy a birthday gift for his<br/>
little cousin and my son, who always has money burning a hole in his<br/>
pocket (chore money) bought a remote control car (on sale).  <br/>
<br/>
This opened up an interest in drag racing in the driveway.  Which led<br/>
to calculating speed.  Ah ha!  Math.  Which in turn got him outside,<br/>
running around.  Ah ha!  PE.  Which made him think he might like to<br/>
start an herb garden.  Ah ha! Plant Science! Don&#39;t know where the last<br/>
thing came from. <br/>
<br/>
I think this is going to work out just fine.</div>

That&#39;s really cool that he&#39;s developed those interests.<br/>
<br/>
But keep in mind that he was learning math while playing video games <br/>
too! He may have discovered gardening through the video game, Harvest <br/>
Moon! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And just because he&#39;s discovered these other things, please don&#39;t get <br/>
disappointed if he leaves them for a new game next week! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll be fine---and if don&#39;t show disappointment over his leaving the <br/>
great outdoors for a new game, you&#39;ll probably see him out again really <br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
Be patient! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
