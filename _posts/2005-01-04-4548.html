<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075038162">&quot;Also, has anyone in the past crammed two families into one hotel <br/>
room?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YES!!<br/>
There were a few of us that did it quietly.<br/>
Marji Zintz and I shared a room the first two conferences. It worked <br/>
well because she only has one child to my crew of four! So I had one <br/>
bed and she and Liam had the other and two of my kids slept on the <br/>
floor.<br/>
It made the conference affordable for both of us.<br/>
