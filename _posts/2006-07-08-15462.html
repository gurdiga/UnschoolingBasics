<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928695359">Under Deadman&#39;s Skin by Jane Katch, was a very interesting read. She<br/>
examins the First graders in her class. But she does it while trying<br/>
hard to control her judgement and see where it leads her. I&#39;m not<br/>
clear why this book called to me, but it was one of those books. I<br/>
figured this might help some people who are still on the fence about<br/>
certain controls, mainly tv and video games. <br/>
&quot;Parents who wish to deny that their child has murderous wishes and<br/>
wants to tear things and even people into pieces believe that their<br/>
child must be prevented from engaging in such thoughts (as if this<br/>
were possible). By denying access to stories which implicitly tell the<br/>
child that others have the same fantasies, he is left to feel that he<br/>
is the only one who imageines such things. This makes his fantasies<br/>
really scary. On the other hand, learning that others have the same or<br/>
similar fantasies makes us feel that we are a part of humanity, and<br/>
allays our fears that haaving such destructive ideas has put us beyond<br/>
the common pale.&quot;<br/>
This really spoke to me. I get a lot of crap because my four year<br/>
watches South Park, The Simpsons, and all kinds of other things many<br/>
main stream people think are wrong. I feel for them, I see their<br/>
points. Although they don&#39;t even listen to mine. Parker has learned so<br/>
much in watching those shows. And he understands that it&#39;s tv, and not<br/>
real life. <br/>
I think what she was saying, is that see any fantasies played out,<br/>
makes us all realize that we are normal or the same as everyone else.<br/>
(okay maybe everyone else, because I have five heads. lmao)<br/>
Thanks for bearing with me. <br/>

I read this book too, interesting.   One thing she wrote that stood <br/>
out for me was (talking about an older child who will be going into <br/>
middle school the next year, and who she had been talking with to <br/>
get a &quot;more experienced&quot; opinion) &quot;For a kid who often feels <br/>
powerless in relation to adults and to other kids, the video games <br/>
are a safe way he can feel stroing and in control.  After a bad day <br/>
at school, he can go to this room and peacefully kill off the <br/>
enemies, making stady progress toward an attainable goal.  With a  <br/>
video game, anyone can be a dominant puppy.  It&#39;s a satisfaction in <br/>
his life that he can count on.  Why should he give it up?  Yet he is <br/>
afraid of his own anger and depression, and he knows that in another <br/>
year he will face big changes, he&#39;ll have to leave the protection of <br/>
his small school where he feels relatively safe and go to a middle <br/>
school that is an unknown, if things got really bad, he wonders, <br/>
could he lose control?&quot; and &quot;If his parents forbade his games, would <br/>
he become more obsessed with his obsession?&quot;   then &quot;I am impressed <br/>
with how frequently Jason tells me his father&#39;s opinion.  These <br/>
conversations and the relationship that surrounds them are deeply <br/>
meaningful to him.  Could it be true that limiting the excessive <br/>
violence and continuing this dialogue is a better middle ground than <br/>
trying to eliminate the games altogether? (helping the children to <br/>
make their own rules and to see the effects)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How fortunate we are to have our kids home, in an environment where <br/>
anything is open to discussion and exploration, and where they don&#39;t <br/>
feel powerless in relation to adults and other kids.<br/>
