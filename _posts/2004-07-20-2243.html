I did get a sling, but am having a hard time <br/>
using it -- I cannot find a position that seems comfy for the baby.   <br/>
He protests whenever we try it, so I have been stuck in a chair most <br/>
of the time...if I am not carrying him while he is attached!<br/>
Just thought I chime in on this part.  Although my dd didn&#39;t have siblings, <br/>
she was/IS very high needs/spirited and hated the slings as well.  I really, <br/>
really wanted to use a sling, but she&#39;d have no part of it : )  I think it felt <br/>
too confining for her.  What I did find she loved was the baby bjorn.  She <br/>
liked being UP and facing out at the world...she had to SEE what was going on all <br/>
the time and then she was happy.  Then in a few months, when she started <br/>
getting heavy in the front carrier, we found a light framed backpack that she <br/>
LOVED.  The only way she&#39;d take a nap was if she was in that backpack and watching <br/>
me do my housework or out on walks...or whatever.   So, I&#39;d just suggest <br/>
trying other styles of carriers...hopefully you&#39;ll find one that she likes because <br/>
it is SO freeing and you&#39;ll be able to be more interactive w/the littles.<br/>
