<div id="ygrps-yiv-142173259">Cross posting unschooling chats online!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
Ten hours or so from posting this, I&#39;m having a two-hour online chat.<br/>
The details are here:<br/>
http://sandradodd. blogspot. com/2009/ 01/live-chats- experiment. html<br/>
<br/>
It will be on young children (at the request of a mom in Montreal).<br/>
1:00 her time; 11:00 a.m my time; check your own time by going to the<br/>
link above, and at that hour go back to that link to get into the<br/>
chatroom.<br/>
<br/>
Friday night, another one, on how it is people learn about<br/>
unschooling, and how they could do it better, maybe.<br/>
Same link.<br/>
<br/>
If someone would like to post this on Unschooling Basics and<br/>
AlwaysUnschooled, that would be nice. I&#39;m not on either of those.<br/>
