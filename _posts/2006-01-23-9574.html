Awesome film, just make sure you screen it first if you have kids that<br/>
don&#39;t care for sex scenes. We really enjoyed it, but had a couple that<br/>
needed to close their eyes for certain parts, because nude sex scenes<br/>
bother them.  It&#39;s short lived, but fairly graphic.<br/>

Jon and I just watched that again this weekend. The lighting in that movie is amazing! Every shot looks like a painting from the 1600&#39;s. Very cool.<br/>

You know what? I just realized I was mixing up the Vermeer movie (Girl<br/>
with a Pearl Earring) with a totally different film called Artemisia.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ts an AMAZING film about a young woman struggling to become a great<br/>
artist in a time when women were not allowed to do art. She&#39;s strong<br/>
and beautiful and such a great role model. THAT&#39;S the movie with<br/>
graphic sex scenes in a couple parts. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Girl with a Pearl Earring had anything graphic that I<br/>
can remember.  ???<br/>

<br/>
No I don&#39;t think it did. There was a sex scene but both people were fully clothed.<br/>

Have you ever read the book Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister by Gregory Maguire? It&#39;s a retelling of Cinderella set in the art world of Europe in the 1600&#39;s. It&#39;s very similar in tone to these movies. It&#39;s a great book.<br/>
