<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066147467">I am very new here and to unschooling. I have been homeschooling my <br/>
two kids since last September. My son is 12 and my daughter is 9. <br/>
They attended a very small public school until last fall. If I had a <br/>
magic life VCR I would rewind and start over when my son was 6 and <br/>
never send either one of them to school  public or otherwise. My <br/>
greatest fear right now is that the damage that was done to their <br/>
self-esteems and spirits cannot be completely undone. <br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that we started out our homeschooling adventure by <br/>
simulating public school at our kitchen table. Fortunately, that <br/>
didn&#39;t last long! My kids hated it and so did I! Then we sort of <br/>
veered toward eclectic homeschooling  we were happier with that, <br/>
but we all still felt pressured. Have we done history this week? <br/>
When is the last time we studied science? OMG we haven&#39;t done math <br/>
in 4 days! Then as luck would have it, we had to move into a <br/>
different house. I got too busy to plan lessons and &quot;teach&quot; math. <br/>
Between working, getting ready to move, hockey practice & games, <br/>
YMCA basketball games & practice, art lessons, .(you get the idea!) <br/>
workbook pages and vocabulary lists were impossible. On the advice <br/>
of a good friend, I decided to just let the kids de-school for a <br/>
while. When I think back I realize that I did it to make myself feel <br/>
better and less guilty! Three or four weeks later  after the move <br/>
and my busy season at work, I thought about getting back into some <br/>
kind of schedule, but I noticed that my kids were doing great. They <br/>
were active, happy, and busy. Why would I want to interfere with <br/>
that? They seemed at peace with each other and the world around <br/>
them. So we became official unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
I do still panic occasionally about math. But then, my kids will <br/>
miraculously end my doubt. For example, the other day I overheard <br/>
them &quot;shopping on Ebay&quot;. Whatever it was they were looking at cost <br/>
$18. Delaney (9) wondered aloud how much 4 of them would cost. <br/>
Bennett (12) who tells everyone who will listen that is can&#39;t do <br/>
math at all, said, &quot;Well, just multiply 4 times 20 and subtract8&quot; <br/>
to which Delaney responded, &quot;Oh, 72  that makes sense! Less than <br/>
$40 for each of us&quot; Immediately Bennett added, &quot;Yes $4 less&quot;  No one <br/>
taught them to do multiplication that way. There was no worksheet or <br/>
textbook. <br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; vocabularies have been growing by leaps and bounds  way <br/>
faster than they did when they were in school and doing weekly vocab <br/>
tests. My only explanation is TV, video games & books on tape.  All <br/>
things I didn&#39;t ask them to do, watch, or listen to! Bennett is an <br/>
avid Harry Potter fan. He has never read one of the books. I read <br/>
book one to him and he has listened to the rest on tape. We also own <br/>
all of the movies. He is actually starting to use phases and words <br/>
from those stories as if they were his own. I love it! (and he <br/>
doesn&#39;t know he is doing it!)<br/>
<br/>
We have very little stress, VERY few disagreements, lots and lots of <br/>
fun, laughter and togetherness. We have gone from a life full <br/>
of &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; to one full of  &quot;want to&#39;s and can&#39;s&quot;.   I still <br/>
worry about their future careers  I try hard not too, but their dad <br/>
is sure he will be supporting them forever if they don&#39;t go to <br/>
college. I don&#39;t worry at all about them growing up to be happy, <br/>
kind, secure adults who know what they like and how to discover the <br/>
answers to any questions they think up. They may not grow up to be <br/>
financially wealthy, but there are other, more important kinds of <br/>
wealth!<br/>

today with opening the door to their freedoms and passions.  it will<br/>
take time for them to deschool, especially if you did school at home<br/>
this past year.  I worried about my oldest who had been in and out of<br/>
school for several years.  I&#39;m happy to say that she has embraced<br/>
unschooling with her whole heart and loves her life!  Your children<br/>
can get there too!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you go to mugglenet there is a list of words and where JK Rowling<br/>
got the words from.  Different names, spells, objects.  There are tons<br/>
of words with Latin roots and people&#39;s names that truly describe them<br/>
- Dumbledore (which means bumble bee) and Umbridge, and accio,<br/>
luminos, nox.  Think that HP isn&#39;t increasing our children&#39;s<br/>
vocabularies?  Think again!<br/>

education, obsessed (passionate) with computers, and the guy is<br/>
rolling in the green (and quite the philanthropist as well!)<br/>
