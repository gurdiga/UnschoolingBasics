<div id="ygrps-yiv-368869563">Ok, I tried to follow the &quot;anything postitive about not having a TV <br/>
thread and got totally lost, so decided to do my own post!  <br/>
<br/>
I have struggled lately with the issue of television.  I can see <br/>
especially in the last few days with my struggles with it that I have <br/>
not totally flipped my internal paradigm with it even though I <br/>
thought <br/>
I had....I still have the same fears come up.  I go back to various <br/>
posts about TV I have bookmarked like off Sandra&#39;s website, and read <br/>
them and it sinks in for awhile, but I really see areas my thoughts <br/>
have not changed.  I have a 7 yr old dd who has always watched shows <br/>
*I* deem acceptable (I am ashamed to even say this on an unschooling <br/>
list...but I have realized I have been thinking this way deep <br/>
down...leave it to my kids to point out things like that) like <br/>
Treehouse TV, Discovery Kids, etc but lately has discovered channels <br/>
like YTv and &quot;older&quot; kids shows, ones that show characters with <br/>
flippant attitudes, older themes, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I am wandering into territory with this that is making me <br/>
uncomfortable, and really making me realize I need to put my money <br/>
where my mouth is, do I really trust my kids and trust natural <br/>
learning?<br/>
I find myself cringing when I keep thinking she needs &quot;something <br/>
better <br/>
to do&quot; (who am I to judge that?) or feeling like the whole day has <br/>
gone <br/>
by with her &quot;just watching TV.&quot;  She makes many plans and asks about <br/>
things she wants to do with me, such as puzzles, baking cookies, etc <br/>
but it seems to go by the wayside and the tv is on all day and she <br/>
has <br/>
watched like literally 7-8 shows in a row., then she complains we <br/>
never <br/>
do anything together..  I find myself swinging widely on <br/>
this...there&#39;s <br/>
days I feel angry at myself because I have not been more proactive in <br/>
offering other options and she is watching TV and I am off doing my <br/>
own <br/>
thing and not watching with her(this is painful for me to admit), <br/>
days I want to throw out the <br/>
tv completely, etc  We have brainstormed possibly getting an on-paper <br/>
tv guide and picking out what she wants to watch each day, and making <br/>
a <br/>
list of things we want to do together (me stopping what I am doing <br/>
and <br/>
her turning it off), etc but so far that has not materialized. I also <br/>
feel she may do this just to &quot;please&quot; me if that makes sense. It&#39;s <br/>
like <br/>
I am quiet about it, and then end up nagging when I try to express my <br/>
thought to her about it.<br/>
<br/>
I am more relaxed than I used to be, as I described above I have <br/>
times <br/>
I generally feel fine with the tv but then days I feel like this.  <br/>
The <br/>
whole &quot;doing nothing but watching TV&quot; feeling ties into an <br/>
undercurrent <br/>
of doubt I am feeling at present about unschooling.  When I have a dd <br/>
who struggles with reading for example and shows very little interest <br/>
in writing (although when I compare her with &quot;her&quot; and not others she <br/>
is growing by leaps and bounds) and a 4 yr old ds who is awaiting <br/>
genetic testing and has been diagnosed with developmental delay  with <br/>
being in size/gross motor skills/speech like an 18 mo-2 yr old, (and <br/>
with the OT freaking out for example that he is not doing more <br/>
coloring <br/>
or playdough or whatever...why I got him a diagnosis is a whole other <br/>
post that I will put up someday but basically his physical challenges <br/>
were causing him alot of difficulty in his life) it is hard to <br/>
silence <br/>
those schooly voices in my head that they are watching it &quot;too much&quot; <br/>
and that &quot;all those studies&quot; are right or that maybe she would be <br/>
reading better if she didn&#39;t watch so much, etc.  I am just trying to <br/>
reconcile that voice with the realization that if I TRULY believe <br/>
that <br/>
everything in my children&#39;s lives is valuable and they can learn from <br/>
it, that I would not limit TV now would I?<br/>
<br/>
OK, I need serious help here!  Ren and others who used to limit TV, <br/>
how <br/>
did you quiet your fears and change your views?<br/>
<br/>
I am really looking forward to personal antecdotes, rebuttals to <br/>
things <br/>
like Jane Healy&#39;s work, and words of wisdom!<br/>

I DO want to say, my 8 1/2 y.o. watches *lots* of TV at various times.<br/>
Well - most times, actually.  He is learning to read just fine, and at<br/>
the perfect time for him.  His Dad was getting a little worried a few<br/>
months ago. I think you can&#39;t *keep* them from reading, there&#39;s so<br/>
much motivation to learn in their daily lives.  Seth was frustrated<br/>
about a year ago that he wasn&#39;t reading, but never wanted to sit down<br/>
and sound out words or anything, so I told him I believed that he<br/>
would learn when it was time for him to, and until then, I&#39;d be happy<br/>
to read for him.  And it&#39;s happening!  Just yesterday, on the bus he<br/>
read &quot;Do Not Open Window While Air Conditioner is On&quot;.  We were both<br/>
so excited! :)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of reading on TV - like signs characters hold up, or if<br/>
someone reads a note.  I know this was motivating to him.<br/>
<br/>
I know you&#39;ll get lots of experiences here.  I&#39;m a new member to this<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-473370529">I think it goes beyond TV.  The trust that you have to have that your child will be OK if you don&#39;t control them.  <br/>
<br/>
Is your children&#39;s happiness one of the most important things to you?    Is their joy in life the goal in your parenting?  For me, joy and happiness is more important than what they end up being when they grow up, or if they are learning enough or reading at the right age.<br/>
<br/>
We did limit TV years ago.  My oldest 2 kids may have watched TV more after I decided that we didn&#39;t want to do limits anymore.  And there still may be days that my youngest, who has never been limited, will watch a few hours of TV.  But there will also be days that the TV doesn&#39;t get turned on at all.<br/>
<br/>
When we moved to a new town,  I think all of them watched more.  There wasn&#39;t as much in our lives at that time and maybe they needed that safe thing, as far as it wasn&#39;t changing like their home or town.<br/>
<br/>
But really, TV is just another resource in our life.  It&#39;s just like a book or a computer or a sewing machine.  If there&#39;s something on that they want to watch they&#39;ll watch it.  If they feel like laying around a bit,  they might watch it or they might not.  We do other things too so they will often choose to do something else. <br/>
<br/>
Let go of time limits and what is &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;.  Some days Kyra (dd10) will play (talk, write, watch music/videos) on the computer for a few hours, some days she won&#39;t be on it at all.  When we first got our sewing machine she&#39;d get up and sew and sew.  But now she hasn&#39;t been on the sewing machine that much.  My son (14) will hardly ever turn on the TV.  But he will play World of Warcraft right now for hours.  He has some goals that he wants to attain in that game right now and it&#39;s important to him.  So that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing.  He will come up and go with us to walk the dog, he will watch a video or 2 with his sister also,  but he will spend hours playing.<br/>
<br/>
I look at his gaming right now as his &quot;specialty&quot;. ;)  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it will take some time to see all they are learning, with and without TV.  Maybe it will take some time to see that TV isn&#39;t bad, look at the happiness and joy that&#39;s in their faces.  For me,  the joy and happiness transcended the worry.  :)<br/>

Yes! I think sharing our journey and asking questions and finding<br/>
folks who have been through similar things is exactly what this list<br/>
is for. When people feel &quot;bashed&quot; its usually because they weren&#39;t<br/>
expecting to be questioned at all and direct questioning can feel very<br/>
personal.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list Caren!! It&#39;s really great to have you here.:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What I see in your post is less about TV and more about your  <br/>
frustration with what you&#39;re doing or not doing and then you&#39;re  <br/>
seeking out TV as a scapegoat.<br/>
<br/>
If she was filling her time with reading or drawing and then  <br/>
complaing that you never do anything, would the problem lie with the  <br/>
reading or drawing? Or would the problem be the lack of planning on  <br/>
your part? Don&#39;t beat yourself up tho! Just plan :-) And rather than  <br/>
planning in order to subtract TV from her life, see the planning as  <br/>
*adding* more choices to her life. Let her choose TV or some other  <br/>
plan. Right now the most exciting option is apparently TV.<br/>
<br/>
TiVo can be a hugely freeing service! It can record programs while  <br/>
you&#39;re out and save them for when you have free time. (With DirecTV  <br/>
satellite it was a bargain at  only $5/mo but with Verizon cable it&#39;s  <br/>
$15/mo but still well worth it.) Before we got it, I taped whatever  <br/>
she wanted to watch during the day so she could have it later. Often  <br/>
she chose not to watch. Part of the draw was that she felt she *had*  <br/>
to watch when the programs were on because otherwise they&#39;d be gone.  <br/>
When she had a choice to watch whenever, it freed her to choose not  <br/>
to watch :-)<br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s growing up. How can she know what&#39;s good to her if someone else  <br/>
decides for her? It&#39;s sort of like learning good art from bad by only  <br/>
seeing what someone else believes is good art and never seeing the  <br/>
rest to learn how to observe yourself.<br/>
<br/>
As for the flippant attitudes, yes, sometimes kids play around with  <br/>
those in real life. Sometimes kids play around being goth too. It  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve decided that&#39;s the best way to be for all time.  <br/>
It&#39;s part of learning by experience.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think there are greater things to be gained in life by being  <br/>
flippant? Do you think your daughter is so unintelligent that she  <br/>
won&#39;t see that too?<br/>

******************************************************<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
My son started watching TV before her was 2, and her really got into  it!  <br/>
He&#39;s 11 now and still does.  I have never limited him, but I  think he has <br/>
gotten a lot of good information from it, and he&#39;s gotten a lot of  enjoyment.<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes he&#39;ll come up with a piece of information or random  fact---and <br/>
when we ask him where he got it, it&#39;s usually TV (or video  games---his main <br/>
passion!) <br/>
 <br/>
From the first television show he ever watched, we have used the closed  <br/>
captioning. I heard later on that it was a good way to help them learn how  to <br/>
read.  I think it must be true because he is an excellent  reader---and he has <br/>
always had a large vocabulary!  People give him a funny  look when these big <br/>
words come out of his mouth! =o)<br/>
 <br/>
A quick example:<br/>
This morning when he woke up, he was a little grumpy, so I said I was going  <br/>
to feed him some &quot;happy flakes&quot; for breakfast. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I then told him to &quot;open up&quot; and pretended to feed them to him.<br/>
He said &quot;This would be a lot better if it were actual sustenance!&quot;<br/>
=o)<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
BTW---I&#39;m new here---and new homeschooling and unschooling!  My son  was in <br/>
public school until 4th grade.  We pulled him out after I started  researching <br/>
HSing---now I&#39;m learning more about unschooling.  Currently we  are applying <br/>
aspects of unschooling---but we haven&#39;t taken the plunge yet!   Part of it  is <br/>
he is still somewhat in that PS mode of thinking, although  he has loosened <br/>
from it a little.  I&#39;m not sure what my hesitation is---I  guess it&#39;s just a <br/>
matter of breaking old habits and growing as a person! <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for letting me be here and sharing your advice and  encouragement!=o)<br/>
