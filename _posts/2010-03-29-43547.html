<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302447955">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I only get around to checking e-mails about every few days.  Also, I get these e-mails through daily digest.  So, I&#39;ve lost track of who I&#39;ve responded to.  Anyway,  thank you for all the suggestions for both bathing and dealing with guilt.  <br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve been less dogmatic about baths/showers the girls have been more willing to take them.  <br/>
<br/>
As for quilt, I am working on letting go of the past and focusing on the future.  Someone suggested that using guilt as a impetus to change and I liked that perspective.  I have found it very helpful <br/>
