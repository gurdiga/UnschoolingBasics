<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439657492">I am discombobulated because I wrote this post and sent it, then every other<br/>
post to every group I wrote subsequently came through and this one did not.<br/>
Therefore, being impatient I am re-posting, and my apologies if you get it<br/>
twice.<br/>
**************************************<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Attitudes take time to change, but I know I can<br/>
do it.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the spirit, Judy! Yes you can.<br/>
<br/>
I have not posted to this general thread, because everyone else has said<br/>
what I would have said, with enormous eloquence. However there are a couple<br/>
of ideas I wanted to revisit.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned earlier that you have only been around a month, and that you<br/>
are still making your way through Sandra&#39;s writing. I would encourage you to<br/>
continue to read all her site.<br/>
<br/>
The most difficult work ahead of you is not in implementing the positive<br/>
changes to your *behavior* that folk have suggested and you are beginning<br/>
(kudos!), but, as you have discovered, it is making the internal changes in<br/>
attitude - paradigm shifts. <br/>
<br/>
I want to suggest that you read back over some of your recent posts, looking<br/>
at the language that you are using to describe yourself. You use imperatives<br/>
a lot that may indicate a lack of belief that you have much broader choices<br/>
than may seem obvious to you. You use &quot;I need&quot;, &quot;I must&quot;, &quot;always&quot; often.<br/>
Some of your statements imply a powerlessness in the face of ....what?<br/>
Convention, the School district, time passing in the day, a preconceived<br/>
notion of what &quot;good parenting&quot; looks like, expectations imposed on yourself<br/>
and others? <br/>
<br/>
Much of your paradigm seems still stuck in the idea that parents and<br/>
children &quot;must&quot; or &quot;will&quot; inevitably be adversaries. I feel sad when I read<br/>
it because I feel that you are trapped by these self-expectations that some<br/>
of your words reveal. The sparkling wonder of Unschooling is that it frees<br/>
the parents to a life of greater joy as much as it frees the children! If<br/>
you keep at it, and don&#39;t get discouraged by the incisive rigor of some of<br/>
the discussion or slide in to a state of defensiveness, the rewards in your<br/>
own spiritual growth can be as enriching as the blossoming brilliance of<br/>
your children as they grow.  <br/>
<br/>
This self-examination and willingness to go through temporarily feeling<br/>
really lousy about the &quot;former self&quot; can be the hard part - but it is<br/>
simplified when we make a conscious effort to change our words to change our<br/>
thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give you a kinda picky example.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter is &quot;in school&quot;. Continuing to keep the idea that it is &quot;only<br/>
Kindergarten&quot; by backing off from the phrases &quot;in school&quot; or &quot;being<br/>
schooled&quot; in your thoughts, is minimizing the damage that Kindergarten can<br/>
do in terms of preparation of the child&#39;s mind for school culture. It is the<br/>
first deposit in an investment in schoolish thoughts and habits and the idea<br/>
of grades and that learning should be directed externally on an imposed<br/>
timetable (in the child&#39;s mind, let alone the parents). <br/>
<br/>
When school is expected, or home is not made more vibrant than school can<br/>
seem, or the child does not *genuinely* choose school (which includes the<br/>
freedom to quit at any time) but instead is trying to fulfill a need in the<br/>
most socially obvious, commonplace way, or because she has simply not had<br/>
the possibility of options discussed, then &quot;sending&quot; one child to school<br/>
will remain a barrier to getting to Unschooling with Joy for the whole<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
You do have more options for fulfilling the true need, once it has been<br/>
discerned and discussed with your dd, and these lists are great places to<br/>
get a quick kick in the pants if you are stuck in an &quot;our choices are<br/>
limited&quot; rut. It seems from what you said that her true need is for friends<br/>
and activities. I endorse what another poster said about finding some local<br/>
groups now, regardless of your timetable for pulling her out. Just recall<br/>
that the fact that she is in school is placing barriers to getting to full<br/>
understanding of Unschooling in your path - not that these cannot be<br/>
overcome.<br/>
<br/>
On a practical note try www.nhen.org both for local groups and Statewide<br/>
organizations that can give you a better idea of your legal options in NH.<br/>
<br/>
I want to endorse what Danielle said, about coming over to Always Unschooled<br/>
also. Please read the list description and guidelines carefully (my<br/>
automatic caution). We are also very rigorous and often have deeply<br/>
incisive, penetrating discussions where we challenge each other to broaden<br/>
our thinking both as parents and, recently, as spouses. <br/>
<br/>
We also have a monthly parenting/learning philosophies book discussion that<br/>
has been wonderful. However that list&#39;s greatest usefulness to you, Judy,<br/>
might be that simply because the focus is on pre-school aged children, the<br/>
attention paid to the &quot;educational component&quot; of Unschooling is minimal,<br/>
while the greatest emphasis is on the Whole Life component of RU - those<br/>
very areas you are exploring.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a files section on the group homepage that includes many other<br/>
articles, links, and book lists that Danielle has been indefatigable in<br/>
compiling for our greater ease of perusal.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the &quot;problem&quot; with it is that Kelly, Ren and Pam aren&#39;t there, so<br/>
do stay here too! <br/>

<br/>
&gt; Ah - that was sweet of you to say.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My BABY is 14. But I LOVE preschool-age children - my mom ran a <br/>
preschool for almost my whole life and I &quot;got&quot; unschooling by <br/>
understanding it as a natural extension of the kind of free-school <br/>
program my mom ran.<br/>
<br/>
I may not be on that list, but it makes me really happy to know it is <br/>
there and you all are there talking about these things while your kids <br/>
are still so young.<br/>
<br/>
LUCKY KIDS!!<br/>
<br/>
(Lucky parents, too!)<br/>
