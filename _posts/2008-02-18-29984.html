<div id="ygrps-yiv-549036359">My mom had always believed that girls and boys should be separated a<br/>
certain age.  As soon as they started to discover there bodies I think<br/>
was her idea.  When she asked what I would do if I had a girl (I&#39;m<br/>
pregnant) and I told her the younger ones could share a bedroom she<br/>
FREAKED.   The younger one is a boy.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s my dilemma.  My son happens to get along with girls quite<br/>
well.  He recently met a new friend at play practice.  She is his<br/>
equal in energy, silliness, and volume!  I would love to see them<br/>
play!  She is a public school student and I haven&#39;t yet met her<br/>
parents.  (she&#39;s 10 and my son is 9)<br/>
<br/>
A few times that he has played with girls, we have witnessed them<br/>
being curious.  Showing butts and lifting shirts and that sort of<br/>
innocent play.  The first time was so innocent and I feel that I never<br/>
should have said ANYTHING to her parents.  They were mad and wouldn&#39;t<br/>
let her play for a long time.  By the time they would, the they had<br/>
grown apart from not seeing each other.  The second time was with<br/>
girls I may not have wanted him to play with.  Or at at least<br/>
unsupervised.  But it did happen.  We had a nice talk about it.  He is<br/>
really open with me which is nice.<br/>
<br/>
I know that this stuff comes up from time to time.  But him being my<br/>
oldest its all new to me.  What if it happens again?  Am I supposed to<br/>
try and prevent it?  I&#39;m not sure I want to encourage it.  But i don&#39;t<br/>
want anyone thinking its wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I really have a very skewed version of sexuality and what is normal<br/>
and healthy for children.  I become very uncomfortable when there are<br/>
sexual scenes in movies and on TV (in regards to my son).  He does not<br/>
know what sex is.  Or sexuality.  Do i introduce it?  Or wait for him<br/>
to ask?  He asked once, and his father told him it was whether you<br/>
were a male or female.  He seemed satisfied, but I&#39;m not sure its what<br/>
he was looking for.  Should sexuality be a regular topic?  and how do<br/>
I do this without shocking him right from the get go.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling comes pretty easily to me.  But unschooling sex and<br/>
sexuality???  This is a hard one for me!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.</div>

criminal- its cute and innocent when they are naked babies crawling <br/>
around or curious when they are potty training but I think 10 is too old<br/>

are they lifting their shirts because they are playing house and <br/>
feeding babbies or is it a i will show you mine sort of thing?<br/>

boys and girls have different bodies and we do not show each other what <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844586540">Whoa!  Criminal?!  Seriously?  For children getting curious about each<br/>
others bodies?  He&#39;s not a predator.  I hope I didn&#39;t make him sound<br/>
like that!  I&#39;ll have to go back and read that.  I was explaining that<br/>
there have been a few times in the past where there has been some<br/>
curious play.  I was more interested in helping my son develop a<br/>
healthy view of his body and sexuality rather than tell him he was a<br/>
criminal for looking at a girls butt when she showed him.  <br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t kids curious?  Isn&#39;t there a way to help them through this<br/>
stuff without telling them they are wrong?   I think a lot of kids<br/>
might hide this stuff from their parents if they were told it was<br/>
criminal or wrong.  I&#39;d like to help make his own decisions in<br/>
situations like this.  I really don&#39;t feel he made any mistakes. <br/>
There was just some peeking going on. <br/>
<br/>
We have definitely talked about it!   It happened at age 6 and at age<br/>
8.   Initiated (admittedly) both times by the girls.  I didn&#39;t have a<br/>
problem discussing it with them at the time.  I just don&#39;t understand<br/>
how to talk to him now that he is getting older, and wondering &quot;why<br/>
girls get filmed naked on TV&quot;  He was referring to a lotion ad where<br/>
the lady was wrapped in bubbles and ribbon or something.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, we still somewhat limit movies and are moving toward not.  (I<br/>
learned with video games to take it easy and just start saying yes<br/>
more.  When I &quot;let go&quot; of video games all at once I had created what<br/>
Sandra Dodd explained to me as a wild party atmosphere.  Ahhh.... live<br/>
and learn.)  It&#39;s totally me, I&#39;m uncomfortable with it.  Give me<br/>
action and violence any day, but I&#39;m so uncomfortable with sex.  I<br/>
really need help handling the questions that could come up.  If feel<br/>
that if I all of the sudden let him start viewing things that he never<br/>
has he might get the wrong idea, rather quickly.<br/>
<br/>
BTW - I would like to clarify.  When I said my view on a healthy<br/>
sexuality for kids for skewed I meant skewed in a &quot;no one ever talked<br/>
about it in my house&quot; way.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also very aware that I&#39;m being way too wordy.  Sorry about that.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238785201">Yes actually criminal.  At your son&#39;s age he could be questioned by<br/>
the police if the parent of a girl complained.  It&#39;s happening all<br/>
over our country.  Boys are looked at like predators in training.  If<br/>
that happens, then Child Protective Services will get involved because<br/>
your child is hyper-sexualized and it must be because he&#39;s being<br/>
abused by his parents or neglected and watching porn on the computer.<br/>
Seriously.  This is not an exaggeration.  It happened to a friend of<br/>
mine in Tuscon with her 8 yr old.  The girl initiated it but he got in<br/>
trouble because in any conflict of this nature the one with the penis<br/>
is the aggressor.  Never underestimate the stupidity of the<br/>
government.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to answer the rest of your questions but the poster<br/>
that said criminal is right.  You have to be so careful now especially<br/>
at your son&#39;s age.  Sad isn&#39;t it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YOUR ARE RIGHT&gt; KIDS ARE CURIOUS AND THAT DOES NOT MAKE THEM <br/>
PREDITORS or criminals. It makes them normal.<br/>
<br/>
Learning healthy sexuality is part of growing up. <br/>
<br/>
Playing doctor with kids happens. It is not molestation or should not <br/>
even be shame based.. AT ALL!<br/>
<br/>
The time it crosses is when someone does not want to show any parts. <br/>
When someone chooses not to participate and is forced or coerced into <br/>
doing that .<br/>
<br/>
I think a bit of redirection if you walk in on something is a good <br/>
plan. <br/>
<br/>
Sex comes with tons of responsibility. Kids need to talk about sex <br/>
with their parents. Just like we talk about everything else with our <br/>
kids. They need to make a plan and think about what their sexual <br/>
choices are. <br/>
<br/>
I think talking to your son openly is your best plan. There is also a <br/>
book that lives on our shelves it is called &quot;ITS PERFECTLY NORMAL&quot;.<br/>
My kids look at it, put it back and then check it out again.<br/>
<br/>
Sexuality is like most growing up. It is a developmental process that <br/>
should not be shrouded in shame, but handled developmentally. When <br/>
our kid asks why a car runs. We may answer because it has an engine. <br/>
We do not explain pistons and gears etc. When our kids ask what is <br/>
the difference between boys  and girls that answers should be <br/>
delelopmental. Follow their lead for more information. <br/>
<br/>
If you observe something that needs talking about, by all means talk <br/>
about it. <br/>
<br/>
It is kids who are not talking about it that are crossing the line <br/>
because no one has shared with them anything about responsible sexual <br/>
behavior. Not in a lecture way, but in an informational way.<br/>
<br/>
I can feel my hackles getting up and my soap box coming out, but I <br/>
really think the reason we have so much sexual depravation in our <br/>
culture is because we advertize it everywhere and then we put a big <br/>
stamp of shame on it in regular conversation. WTF&gt; Kids need answers <br/>
and information and they will be exploring. That is how god willing <br/>
they will become sexually healthy adults.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551634164">I had that book too! :o)  There is also the next one in the series that is called &quot;What&#39;s Happening To Me&quot;, all about puberty.  The pictures are funny, but it actually was great for me at the time (around 10) because it showed in a light way that there are *all* different types of bodies.  For instance there are pictures of all different shapes, sizes and positioning of breasts, and some of them are so ridiculous that mine seemed perfectly okay after looking at those pictures.<br/>
   <br/>
  You mentioned that you are &quot;so uncomfortable with sex&quot;...perhaps take a look at that?  Be willing to explore your history, etc. about that??  I know that I have often been grateful for how matter-of-fact my mom was about the whole sex thing when I was younger, and I&#39;m sure kids pick up as much from our own history/energy about an issue as from our words, and perhaps more.  Just a thought.<br/>

&gt;my mom was about the whole sex thing when I was younger, and I&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt;kids pick up as much from our own history/energy about an issue as<br/>
&gt;from our words, and perhaps more.  Just a thought.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have an interesting family.  LOL  It was never talked about.  Yet,<br/>
they all seemed to be VERY sexually active at one point or another or<br/>
*ahem* always.  My grandmother, so I&#39;ve been told, had more than her<br/>
fair share of men before and during her marriage.  LOL  She used to<br/>
make us all say &quot;sex&quot; instead of &quot;cheese&quot; when taking our pictures. <br/>
No joke.  And it worked.  We always smiled!<br/>
<br/>
So I can&#39;t say I&#39;m totally uncomfortable.  What I said was &quot;I become<br/>
very uncomfortable when there are sexual scenes in movies and on TV<br/>
(in regards to my son).&quot;  I think this is because he is a boy.  I<br/>
think I&#39;m just scared.  Scared that he won&#39;t have a healthy outlook on<br/>
sex.  so many teenagers are the victim of an oversexed world.  It<br/>
scares me.   But your right.  I do need to take a look at that.  I<br/>
also need to remember that most of my education came from public<br/>
school and peers.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255692858">I would love to hear from a nudist on this subject and when or if <br/>
they wear clothes around their children after a certain age.  <br/>
<br/>
I speak to my children with words such as sex (when dad and I need <br/>
some alone time, I tell them this is what we are doing and answer any <br/>
questions, there haven&#39;t been many yet), vagina, bottom, penis, <br/>
testicles, masterbation.  Non of these words are bad and we often use <br/>
them in public.  My son is very interested in girls - it seems on all <br/>
levels - he tends to have a better friendship with females which <br/>
leads them to trust each other and become curious.  I have no problem <br/>
with this at all.  I don&#39;t really know what I would do if it bothered <br/>
someones parent.  But the shame we have in this country about sex (we <br/>
can let kids watch guns but not see a breast, remember the superbowl)<br/>
starts somewhere - How do we stop this and make it love instead of <br/>
this obscure forbidden desire?  <br/>
<br/>
Also rape is not a sexual act and I can&#39;t believe that a child&#39;s <br/>
curiousity was compared to a criminal act.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185748066">Aaaah, I think I see where the &quot;Criminal&quot; thing is coming from. It&#39;s <br/>
not that it *IS* criminal, just that in our sometimes messed up <br/>
society, it is often treated as such.<br/>
<br/>
I know a 13 year old boy who was caught with an 11 yr old girl and even <br/>
though it was mutual and the girl didn&#39;t want to press charges, the dad <br/>
flipped and now this boy has to register as a sex offender, possibly <br/>
for the rest of his life if they don&#39;t seal his record. It&#39;s a messed <br/>
up system.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, *your son is not a criminal* and his natural <br/>
curiousities shouldn&#39;t be treated a such. (This boys were treated that <br/>
way and that is why he had a skewed perception of sex and had to look <br/>
for answers on his own.) <br/>
<br/>
Z is 8 years old and doesn&#39;t want to know a thing about sex. He seems <br/>
to have a vague awareness of it and avoids it like the plague. We are <br/>
open and make mention of it here or there (carefully so he&#39;s not <br/>
embarassed but so that he knows we can be open about it). With all the <br/>
ED commercials on TV, I&#39;m waiting for him to ask me what &quot;male <br/>
enhancement&quot; is! But I don&#39;t bring the topic up in depth yet. <br/>
<br/>
The extent of my education when I was young was my mom leaving a few <br/>
books on the kitchen table for me to find. I don&#39;t want to take that <br/>
approach!<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m also curious as to what others say about how to approach the <br/>
topic and when.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; criminal for looking at a girls butt when she showed him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I said at some point it becomes criminal- you want to address it <br/>
before that point- <br/>
<br/>
A healthy view of sexuality is keeping your privates private because <br/>
in our society that is what is acceptable- <br/>
<br/>
you said your child was 10 but the exploring actually happened when <br/>
he was 6 and 8- which is I think a little more about normal <br/>
curiosity but boys and girls start internally changing at about 10- <br/>
girls are having their periods at 10- this COULD be more about sex <br/>
than body curiosity<br/>
<br/>
I think it healthy to explain that privates are privates- even when <br/>
consensual- some states the consenual age is 16 or 18- before that <br/>
it is illegal to have sex- not sure if that means everything before <br/>
sex or just actual sex- <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Aren&#39;t kids curious?  Isn&#39;t there a way to help them through this<br/>
&gt; stuff without telling them they are wrong? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would not say it is BAD just not something to do in public- my <br/>
girls are 5 and 3 and they mostly just wear underwear at home BUT <br/>
when visitors come over they go get clothes on because wearing your <br/>
underwear is what you can do at home but not with friends and <br/>
neighbors and others<br/>
<br/>
if we lived in a culture where running around nude was acceptable <br/>
then it would not be a problem- I told my daughter when she grew up <br/>
if she wanted to live with the nudists she could - after she asked <br/>
of boys would be there ( she knows boys pee pee bums look different <br/>
because she had a potty training boy around) she decided that she <br/>
would not live with the boy nudists cause they look funny. <br/>
<br/>
its not bad it is just not what we do<br/>

<br/>
  I think a lot of kids<br/>

&gt; situations like this. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>what you do not want is the girls parents making the choice of what <br/>
is out of line- <br/>
<br/>
just as boys need to know that if they are having sex and the girl <br/>
get pregnant he does not get a choice as to what happens to the baby <br/>
SHE does<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I really don&#39;t feel he made any mistakes. <br/>

on? unless he is asking or wondering about actual sex I would just <br/>
explain that clothes or unders should be on.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 I just don&#39;t understand<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how to talk to him now that he is getting older, and wondering &quot;why<br/>
&gt; girls get filmed naked on TV&quot;  He was referring to a lotion ad <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the lady was wrapped in bubbles and ribbon or something.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ask him if he thinks she forgot her clothes or thinks they should <br/>
put some on- explain that you can not see her privates that the <br/>
bubbles are her pretend clothes- explain that they want you to buy <br/>
to lotion and it feels so good.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, we still somewhat limit movies and are moving toward not.  (I<br/>

&gt; action and violence any day, but I&#39;m so uncomfortable with sex.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think we are more comfortable knowing that violence is not real <br/>
and removed from us but sexuality IS part of our lives and is real <br/>
and does happen and where do we go with it.<br/>
<br/>
Explaining that you think the women on tv need some clothes is ok- <br/>
explaining WHY the ads are like they are in kid terms could help<br/>
<br/>
  I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; really need help handling the questions that could come up.  If <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; has he might get the wrong idea, rather quickly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>like what? are you going to sit down and watch porn? if he is <br/>
watching tv ads then talk about them simple and non judgmental- so <br/>
not saying something like &quot;those people are bad and wrong and tv is <br/>
bad and it is disgusting&quot; that is not the same as saying &quot;gosh I <br/>
think they lost their clothes- oh dear they need to do that in <br/>
private opps I pushed the wrong button on the remote. <br/>
<br/>
your son is getting older and his boy is going to start changing <br/>
SOON at least internally and so leaving the funny books around is <br/>
good but also explaining that it is private is important but you are <br/>
mom and you will answer ANY questions that he has.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW - I would like to clarify.  When I said my view on a healthy<br/>

siblings came to for sex answers so I learned quickly to find the <br/>
answers- still as adults they still come to me when then need to <br/>
know something- I think info is so important but also is explaining <br/>
how things exist in our society is important too.<br/>

&gt; how things exist in our society is important too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>good points.  thanks for your thoughtful replies.  This is really<br/>
helping me work this all out.  I know its a tough subject, and many<br/>
people have different ideas on this, and probably why I haven&#39;t seen<br/>
many responses.  hopefully the dialogue can keep going.  I&#39;ve already<br/>
felt a little more at ease.<br/>

<br/>
if you feel physical fighting is ok and then your child or teen <br/>
physically fights with people there is a point where it becomes a <br/>
crime - assult- you get locked up. There is a time and place for <br/>
fighting and a time where it just is not going to work<br/>

I do not agree with all the sexual laws either but since they are <br/>
there and he will be interacting with another person you need to be <br/>
aware of them because you can not tell the police that you just do <br/>
not agree with the laws<br/>
<br/>
like unschooling you have to live within the laws or at least not <br/>
run up against them but it gets tricky when they are interacting <br/>
with another child who may go home and tell parents and then they <br/>
get involved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286572157">Well, criminal activity aside: <br/>
<br/>
He came home today and asked me how to tell a girl that he wants to be<br/>
her boyfriend.  *giggle*<br/>
<br/>
I really think I handled the conversation well.  It was the most<br/>
innocent conversation, yet so grown up at the same time.  I wish I had<br/>
the time to write it all here.<br/>
<br/>
I think he was under the impression that he HAD to ask her since he<br/>
liked her so much.  I have 3 teenage siblings and I wonder if he<br/>
picked up something from their conversations.  He actually said &quot;well,<br/>
don&#39;t I need to find someone to live with?&quot;.  I said &quot;my goodness no.<br/>
 Not yet.&quot; And he had this relieved smile on his face.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
So anyway...  Open dialogue.  Honesty.  Trust.  It&#39;s working again.  I<br/>
think I&#39;m regaining some faith in myself.  I must have felt this<br/>
coming  or something.  LOL</div>

nakedness as just nakedness with no shame involved.  My children are <br/>
dd9, ds11, and dd15 and they still see me totally undressed at <br/>
times.  It doesn&#39;t bother any of them as they seem to have no <br/>
problem coming into the bedroom or bathroom while I&#39;m there.  My <br/>
younger two kids see my DH naked as well.  My dd15 is his <br/>
stepdaughter so he&#39;s always been very courteous and discreet when <br/>
she&#39;s around.  She doesn&#39;t go into the bedroom or bathroom if she <br/>
knows he may be undressed.  <br/>
<br/>
All of my children prefer privacy when they shower and/or change <br/>
clothes.  My dd9 will let me and DH into the bathroom when she&#39;s <br/>
changing but she doesn&#39;t want her sister or brother to come in.  We <br/>
do the &#39;respect closed doors&#39; thing.  If a door is closed, you must <br/>
knock on it and wait for an answer.  We&#39;ve always done this with the <br/>
kids even when they were toddlers.<br/>
<br/>
While we believe there is no shame in the naked body, we also <br/>
believe that private parts are private.  That means each individual <br/>
should decide their own comfort level.  But we also talk about <br/>
societal (is that a word?) expectations.  In other words, we talk <br/>
about what is and is not accepted outside the house.  <br/>

<br/>
Well, if an adult were to do it (even if the child were to do it in <br/>
just a few short years), it *would* be considered criminal. That&#39;s <br/>
something to keep in mind. What&#39;s acceptable today can become quite <br/>
unacceptable and illegal in just a short span of years.<br/>
<br/>
Curiosity needs to be satisfied; but as the child gets older, &quot;playing <br/>
doctor&quot; may not be the best way to acquire information.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember the age of the child in question; but IMO eight seems <br/>
OK, ten seems questionable, and 12 seems too old---as a general <br/>
rule---to be playing doctor.<br/>
<br/>
When Cameron was 12-ish, I got a dozen or so books from the library and <br/>
left them in his room. They were quite a source of laughter among his <br/>
friends for a while. But then, they started actually reading them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;ve never been shy about nudity in our family---or about <br/>
discussing sex. Both boys seemed to naturally become more modest after <br/>
being mostly naked toddlers/children. Up until Duncan was 9-ish, I <br/>
guess, one of his best friends was a girl that used to spend the night <br/>
regularly. They&#39;ve naturally put some distance between themselves these <br/>
last few years. If he&#39;d shown &quot;too much&quot; interest, we would have talked <br/>
about it more. The idea of sex is still icky to him as he&#39;s about to <br/>
turn 12. Again---a few years will change that too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So---age can matter---practically as well as legally. It pays to pat <br/>
attention and answer questions as openly and honestly as possible. <br/>
Helping them be aware of what&#39;s socially acceptable as they age is <br/>
GOOD. Things change so fast!<br/>

<h4>ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH</h4>
<p><small><time>20 Feb 2008, at  4:31am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-306661527">A month ago or so David (dh) was looking through the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), a database based on information from anthropological ethnographies, for information on men seeking medical treatment in other cultures. Unfortunately (but amusingly) HRAF isn&#39;t a particularly well organised database and he stumbled across a little piece of an ethnography that talked about how grown women within this group would often walk up to a young boy and pull on their penis and say something like &quot;with something that little how you are ever going to please a woman&quot; and men making fun of little girls flat chests not being able to feed a baby. The funny thing is, for me at least, that the story of this different<br/>
 culture, this open treatment of sex made me feel relieved about the openness with which David and I treat sex in our family. I don&#39;t pull on Simon&#39;s penis and comment on it, and no one has commented on Linnaea&#39;s potential to breastfeed given her current lack of bra size, but they watch Family Guy and recently have come to enjoy South Park (which makes me very uncomfortable) and we have open conversations about sex brought on by Leisure Suit Larry the PS2 game as well as television shows. Although for a long time Simon wouldn&#39;t say the word sex, he had to spell it saying S-E and then slashing the x into the air. I didn&#39;t tend to bring it up when he felt that shyly about the subject. And if he asked a question that would lead to a discussion about S-E hand slash I would say something like the answer might make you uncomfortable and he would choose whether to talk about it or not. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There is a book I read years ago by Marjorie Shostak called Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman. It is a biography of this woman Nisa as told to Marjorie Shostak. There is a scene in the book with Nisa as a young girl lying on the ground in bed next to her parents who are having sex and she pulls away a little bit. Not far &#39;cause it&#39;s cold out, but a little bit away. Reading that I can remember thinking about how bizarre it is to not know anything but books and words about sex until you have it. Not that I am suggesting that children should be in bed with parents when they are having sex, nor that children should be raised outside of their own culture&#39;s norms. I guess what I am trying to say is that a healthy outlook on sex may be one in which sex is a part of public conversation and part of what makes it public conversation in my life is the media. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been watching a BBC series with David Attenborough called Life in Cold Blood for the past few weeks. The show had a segment on a species of newt where the male courted the female and when accepted by her he would lay a sperm packet on the ground which she would walk over and pick up. It was a near sexless exchange. And it was very cool to think about how different sex can be. It was a sex cell transfer that I&#39;d never heard about before and it started some very cool conversations about sex and sexlessness and tapered off as something else came up on the show. There is balance to the discussions and the openness about sex that Simon and Linnaea experience. There is a lot of humor and intensity given the shows they like to watch. Giggidy Giggidy is a common catchphrase among friends, the cultural leveler. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think media exposure will produce the sex-crazed, amoral individuals that Larry Clark portrayed in the movie Kids. Man did that movie disturb me. I think there is more that underlines the amorality of a child than his purely superficial, in that moment, movie depicted. <br/>

===================<br/>
<br/>
So I can&#39;t say I&#39;m totally uncomfortable.  What I said was &quot;I become<br/>
very uncomfortable when there are sexual scenes in movies and on TV<br/>
(in regards to my son).&quot;  I think this is because he is a boy.  I<br/>
think I&#39;m just scared.  Scared that he won&#39;t have a healthy outlook on<br/>
sex.  so many teenagers are the victim of an oversexed world.  It<br/>
scares me.  But your right.  I do need to take a look at that.  I<br/>
also need to remember that most of my education came from public<br/>
school and peers.  <br/>
