<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104712835">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kim and I have 2 children (5 and 3).  Right now we live in NC where the compulsory age is 7 so I haven&#39;t had to do anything with the state yet.  But we&#39;ll be moving to SC in Dec/Jan with my dh who&#39;s stationed there, and the compulsory age there is 5.  Is there anyone who lives in SC who has any advice for me as far as the laws go?  I looked over the laws and it looks like option #3 would be the best one (because you don&#39;t have to deal with the public schools) but I was hoping somebody could give me some real life experience with SC law and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
<br/>
Kim : )<br/>
