<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So what John Holt book would you recommend for the first book to read? I<br/>
have a list of many of his books, but not sure which one to start with. Just<br/>
to remind you my dd is 4 if that matters.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Depends. Are you in a hurry? &lt;g&gt; I&#39;d start at the beginning and read  first <br/>
to last----which is exactly what I did! The neat thing about that is  that you <br/>
can see his progression from school reformer to unschooling  advocate.<br/>

You&#39;re a dork. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
But I&#39;m that way with Barbara Sher&#39;s book, Wishcraft. I *know* it&#39;s  probably <br/>
chocked FULL of smart stuff, but I can&#39;t seem to plow through more  than the <br/>
first chapter or so. Everything she said, I already understood. I  live my <br/>
life that way already. I kept waiting to get to the &quot;good&quot; stuff!<br/>
 <br/>
So maybe you already &quot;get&quot; what Holt has to say, and it&#39;s just blah----like  <br/>
Sher&#39;s book for me. The Holt books were incredibly novel to me when I  first <br/>
read them, in order----so I took a lot from them.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe?<br/>

because friends of mine have said how enlightening and life changing <br/>
they were and I keep looking for something REALLY &quot;profound&quot; in them <br/>
but don&#39;t see &quot;it&quot; -- in other words, I&#39;m not reading anything that I <br/>
don&#39;t know / do / live already.    You may be right, Kel!  ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, sure that makes all the difference in the world.  Back before the <br/>
days of the Internet ideas weren&#39;t as easily transfered great <br/>
distances; people with similar thoughts and interests were not able to <br/>
connect like we do today.  Reading his books back then WAS probably <br/>
very enlightening!!!  I&#39;ve been online for about 5 years now and - <br/>
thanks to people like you gals and Sandra and Peggy O&#39;Mara etc. - I&#39;ve <br/>
&quot;heard&quot; about all this stuff already and seen it in real life working.  <br/>
So, for me, to go back now and read these books I guess is a little <br/>
redundant and that&#39;s why they seem &quot;dry&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If this is all new to you though then I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be really cool!  <br/>

******************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I read Holt, I was new to the whole concept of unschooling.  I read <br/>
everything by him and numerous other notable unschooling authors.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that we&#39;ve been at this for a bit and I&#39;ve done more reading than I <br/>
should admit, I&#39;m beginning to have trouble getting through much of anything on <br/>
the subject.  Most notably, Frank Smith, whose &quot;Insult To Intelligence&quot; would <br/>
have held me enraptured a year ago.  I feel I&#39;ve finally reached my saturation <br/>
point.  We&#39;re living it, we&#39;re doing it.  Everything he writes makes sense, but <br/>
I&#39;m no longer &quot;fascinated&quot;.<br/>

express an interest in unschooling....in fact I just mentioned to my daughter,  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ya know, that could be it really.  I try to read his<br/>
&gt; different books <br/>
&gt; because friends of mine have said how enlightening<br/>
&gt; and life changing <br/>
&gt; they were and I keep looking for something REALLY<br/>
&gt; &quot;profound&quot; in them <br/>
&gt; but don&#39;t see &quot;it&quot; -- in other words, I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; reading anything that I <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know / do / live already.    You may be right,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I felt like this too when I read...Something about<br/>
&quot;Your spirited child&quot; (is that the name?)..It had been<br/>
so talked about for years, I  found it at a garage<br/>
sale and had to pick it up...But gads, it was so<br/>
disrespectful, so &quot;DUH!!&quot;...I couldn&#39;t get through<br/>
more than the first chapter...I can&#39;t give examples<br/>
now, but stupid things like &quot;Your kid runs around and<br/>
gets into things....has it ever occured to you that<br/>
maybe he&#39;s NOT bad?&quot;  UGH!  I know where they were<br/>
going with it, but it WAS NOT a book for me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981610851">Thanks Dana,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear it wasn&#39;t the books themselves, just other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; ones in that long? Is<br/>
&gt; it some reason with the books or just life in<br/>
&gt; general..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess what everyone else has said...Learning all the<br/>
time spoke to me when I got it, the others were just<br/>
dry and hard to get through for me.  I read learning<br/>
all the time when my daughter was an infant, and I<br/>
guess it was just what I needed when I needed it.  I&#39;m<br/>
surprised--I have always loved educational<br/>
philosophy...But I guess I already had all I needed<br/>
and reading the rest was just a repeating it.  I<br/>
recently tried &quot;How children learn&quot; one more time, and<br/>
again didn&#39;t get past the baby at the beginning&#39;s<br/>
second birthday or so...Ya got me!  I don&#39;t know!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747509499">Hi Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I just got an e-mail from Ren with a link to this group at the bottom <br/>
of it ~ so I joined!  And I just wanted to write about John Holt ~<br/>
<br/>
When my son was very young, I read parenting books and magazines and <br/>
none of them seemed to fit my child.  One day in the library, *divine <br/>
intervention* placed my hand on a John Holt book.  When I read that <br/>
book, I cried.  Someone finally knew my child and understood how I <br/>
wanted to parent him ~ to me, it wasn&#39;t a book on *education*...it <br/>
was a book on life with my child.<br/>
<br/>
I ate up every John Holt book I could, fell in love with the man, and <br/>
deeply mourned when I found out he was no longer alive.  I wished he <br/>
could have been a Dad himself.<br/>
<br/>
I lend out all of my John Holt books, too...but recently got *Instead <br/>
of Education* from the library and I just love that one.  I have to <br/>
buy that one.<br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So what John Holt book would you recommend for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; first book to read? <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;  I have just finished a great unschooling book<br/>
 </span></blockquote>written by a student of Holt&#39;s and former public<br/>
school teacher that I found very easy to read and<br/>
interesting....documents her and family&#39;s journey<br/>
through unschooling from the beginning all the way<br/>
through her son being admitted to college.  The title<br/>
is Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling Ourselves<br/>
by Alison McKee<br/>
Very supportive to the new unschooler since she talks<br/>
about her doubts and resolutions, highs and lows....<br/>
but you get the overwhelming sense that unschooling<br/>
really worked for this family.<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
