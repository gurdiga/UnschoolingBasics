<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475879713">We just finished visiting with some friends who lost every &quot;thing&quot; !but not their friends! in hurricane katrina. We came up with some great mosaic ideas for some of their dishes that they found at their &quot;lot&quot;......<br/>
They now live 16 hours away but are thinking of moving back!<br/>
Earlier we flipped our pennies for franklin and posted or results and then played more of the money games listed at the site. We also started the mustard and silver money experiment after searching thru the entire house for coins that are older than 1965......<br/>
At this very moment, the boys are returning the old CPU&#39;s and keyboards and vcrs and dvd players that they took apart(in the past) and played with today .....<br/>
I also hear some Legos clicking around.....<br/>
Wow, what a great day ;-)<br/>
