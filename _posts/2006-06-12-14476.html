<div id="ygrps-yiv-343572774">Hi...I just joined a little bit ago.  I feel the need to connect with<br/>
other unschoolers, to be inspired and to get support.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you might remember me from WAY back when there were message<br/>
boards at unschooling.com.  I posted a few times at unschooling.info but<br/>
haven&#39;t done much posting anywhere for the last year or two.   I&#39;m<br/>
Heather Hongslo (the one who usually had tons of questions)  from Alaska<br/>
and I have 3 kids, Tanner 10, Hunter 7 1/2 and Haley 5.    I recognize<br/>
many of the names on posts here so hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
To be truthful...I&#39;m not sure what I have been doing.  Most days lately<br/>
it seems like we are totally unschooling.  We are doing interesting<br/>
things, living our lives, kids are learning...doing...playing...   A few<br/>
years ago I thought I finally got unschooling but the last few years we<br/>
had craziness going on with selling our house, moving, having a home<br/>
built and moving again.  I pretty much did nothing with the kids.  Sure<br/>
they learned first hand about putting a house up for sale and all the<br/>
things that go into building a house but we had hardly any time for<br/>
anything else, or I didn&#39;t feel up to anything else because those were<br/>
stressful times.<br/>
<br/>
Tanner had to have state assessments for the past 2 years and both times<br/>
passed Below Proficiency.    (He is required to take the testing so we<br/>
can get an allotment each year.)  So because I had my issues and<br/>
doubts...Last fall I ordered some curriculum(ugh!)  but that was short<br/>
lived when I realized what a mistake I had made and put most of it away.<br/>
Hunter loved the Phonics Set and for awhile we played with that every<br/>
day...but the rest was a big waste of money from my parental panic<br/>
attack!   I feel I am horribly failing because I should have presented<br/>
Tanner different opportunities or ways to grasp the things he&#39;d be<br/>
tested on.   He hasn&#39;t been able to grasp different concepts because he<br/>
has never had the need to grasp them or they haven&#39;t come up for him in<br/>
his life.  I feel that is my fault.  Some of my stress I feel on this is<br/>
because when I&#39;m around other homeschoolers I feel like I am not doing<br/>
enough compared to them.  I know I shouldn&#39;t compare myself to them or<br/>
my kids to their kids but it makes me wonder...and then all the what ifs<br/>
come up.   My dh seems to think testing results matter more than I do so<br/>
that has caused a little stress for me.  Although my dh doesn&#39;t put me<br/>
to blame he just thinks we need to do more with Tanner.  Which I agree.<br/>
But I want to do it in a way that is something fun, exciting, something<br/>
Tanner wants to do on his own not because we are telling him to do<br/>
something...basically in an unschooling sort of way.  I&#39;m looking for<br/>
ideas on spelling and writing.  I&#39;ve read over and over that spelling<br/>
and writing happens from reading.  Tanner doesn&#39;t like to read on his<br/>
own.   He however likes me to read to him and for now that is what I<br/>
have been doing.  Actually... I have been doing this for years with<br/>
Tanner.   Patiently waiting.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is not Tanner.  Maybe it is me.  Maybe I need to get rid of all<br/>
my doubts, concerns, issues.  I guess as I am writing this I am getting<br/>
some of my answers.  Still I&#39;d love to get some responses, ideas,<br/>
suggestions...sorry I got this so long for my first posting.<br/>

  Thats why it&#39;s good to stay away from state-supported homeschooling! <br/>
&lt;g&gt; That money looks really swell!<br/>
<br/>
 Forget the assessments!<br/>
<br/>
  Is he bright? Is he learning? How can you tell? By talking with him? <br/>
By watching him tackle something new?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 It&#39;s *always* good to do more! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  But what will more testing, more workbooks, more requirements actually <br/>
accomplish?<br/>
<br/>
  How about just doing more WITH him? BEing WITH him? Going for walks <br/>
and bringing home new things and talking about new ideas and eating new <br/>
foods. DO more!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 But I want to do it in a way that is something fun, exciting, something<br/>
 Tanner wants to do on his own not because we are telling him to do<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 But with schoolish results?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 I&#39;m looking for<br/>
 ideas on spelling and writing. I&#39;ve read over and over that spelling<br/>
 and writing happens from reading.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Some people *like* to write. Some don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 Some people are natural spellers. Some aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 Why are these sticky points for you?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 Tanner doesn&#39;t like to read on his<br/>
 own. He however likes me to read to him and for now that is what I<br/>
 have been doing. Actually... I have been doing this for years with<br/>
 Tanner. Patiently waiting.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Not very patiently. He&#39;s only ten.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d suggest to quit waiting. Enjoy reading to him. He won&#39;t always <br/>
*want* you to read to him. Enjoy it while you&#39;ve got it; you&#39;re going <br/>
to miss it when it&#39;s gone! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  If you&#39;re waiting, you&#39;re not being patient! &lt;g&gt; You&#39;re sitting on the <br/>
edge, biting your fingers until he takes the lead.<br/>
<br/>
 Plunge ahead, he&#39;ll follow!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe it is not Tanner. Maybe it is me. Maybe I need to get rid of all<br/>
 my doubts, concerns, issues.<br/>

<br/>
 Yeah---maybe! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That just means below an average procificiency arbitrarily set for kids in a certain grade. It has nothing to do with Tanner or what he knows or who he is or what he&#39;s going to do in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;He hasn&#39;t been able to grasp different concepts because he<br/>

<br/>
There is no fault here. The test doesn&#39;t matter if he&#39;s not in school. He&#39;s got plenty of time to learn. He&#39;s got his whole life. I&#39;d drop the  allottment program. It seems like it&#39;s causing more harm thatn it&#39;s worth.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Maybe it is not Tanner. Maybe it is me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe. :o) I know what I think. What does your heart tell you?<br/>
