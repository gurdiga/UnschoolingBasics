<div id="ygrps-yiv-925847953">This struck a chord in me, and I feel sorry for her. <br/>
<br/>
She obviously feels very insecure and is reacting defensively against her own fears (the irony!) masked as barriers between her and other unschoolers.  Though there are plenty of distinctions she has hit upon that are relevant--she does impose more rules and limits than her radical unschooling peers. <br/>
<br/>
I have been there before and it&#39;s not easy.  She has probably spent as much time (if not more) beating herself up as she has spent putting others down. It&#39;s all about her trying to feel ok about her choices, while realizing there are better choices out there.  That&#39;s a really scary concept!!<br/>
<br/>
That said, Ren, your comment to this woman was beautiful and inspiring, as it referenced the joy and freedom your family has.  Nothing angry or belittling.  As an unschooler, growing more radical, I appreciated reading it. :)<br/>

  This blog is from an unschooler who has lived the life and is now<br/>
  bashing unschooling. What do people think about the points she makes<br/>
  here? There are no comments posted yet, so I don&#39;t get the &quot;other<br/>
  side&quot; of this. It kind of makes me feel a bit defensive and or<br/>
  misguided to read what she has here. Is she really not seeing the<br/>
  whole picture???<br/>
