<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518946817">I absolutely love these groups (sorry for the double posting but wanted <br/>
to make sure I get all the help I can ;-) ) and have learned so much <br/>
since &quot;switching over to the dark side&quot;...just teasing...he he he.  <br/>
Anyway, I am still very unsure about how to present a portfolio for my <br/>
review.  I&#39;ve read Sandra Dodd&#39;s site on curriculum and found it very <br/>
useful except for showing something tangible come review day.  Last <br/>
review was a breeze;  here&#39;s workbook a, here&#39;s workbook b, bla bla <br/>
bla.  I know he&#39;s continuing to use his knowledge of mathematical <br/>
principals, applying them in everyday life and understanding them quite <br/>
well I might add - better than the boring workbook days - but how do I <br/>
show his progress?  handwriting too...gone are the daily copy work <br/>
lessons we used to do and he hasn&#39;t volunteered to write anything yet.  <br/>
(BTW - he&#39;ll be 8 next year)<br/>
<br/>
Also -advice wanted from any fellow West Virginians who have had <br/>
experience with unschooler friendly portfolio reviewers or does everyone <br/>
test?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance to all of you wonderful contributors!<br/>
