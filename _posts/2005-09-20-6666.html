<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748470778">Here we go....&quot;my husbands and my cup of tea&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We used to have the PS2 rule (I know...rule...but that was before this new<br/>
adventure) that our daughter could only (I know...only) play the PS2 for one<br/>
whole weekend per month.  We felt she would always go nutty with it and just<br/>
sit all day long.  I feel so rediculous putting this down... I sound like an<br/>
idiot. haha  Did we really do that...PS2 rule?  In fact, she did go nutty<br/>
and sat all day and night.  Well, obviously...we set it up so that she would<br/>
have to be completely compulusive about it for the 3 days because we would<br/>
then snatch it out from under her.  Gosh, I would do the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Sooo, now to the present.  In the realization of our big mistake, we threw<br/>
the Rule out the door.  Yes, we&#39;ve read and continue to read probably<br/>
everything on-line regarding the benefits of video games.  And we are seeing<br/>
those benefits.  So, being what we considered prepared...we went on the<br/>
journey with her.  We play it with her or just hang out and watch with her.<br/>
Yes, for almost 4 weeks (I am not exagerating) she has sat and played the<br/>
games from about 7:30 in the morning till 10:00 or so at night when she<br/>
chooses to go to sleep.  Now, most of the days we do go out<br/>
somewhere...fieldtrip, etc.  So some of the time, I would say about 4 hours<br/>
or so, is taken up with one of her activities.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m rambling...will get to the point.  We are keeping our mouths shut<br/>
and letting this whole thing play itself.....but, even though we are<br/>
prepared, we are both having problems (yes, I know it&#39;s our problem) with<br/>
her just sitting and sitting.  She used to go on the trampoline for hours,<br/>
just hang out outside, etc.  The whole non-exercise thing freaks us out.  We<br/>
know that she will eventually move on...or not.  But, we need some words of<br/>
wisdom and strength to continue to let this ride on its own and to keep our<br/>
mouth shut and honestly to just be okay with it.  I know we&#39;ll get there,<br/>
but just need some lovin advise and strength right now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much.<br/>

lol... I don&#39;t know... we have &quot;game time&quot; that is roughly an hour and a  <br/>
half a day. But it&#39;s flexible. Like today, it&#39;s dark, dreary and pouring out and  <br/>
I&#39;ve been out of commission with back problems, so they can play longer. They <br/>
 usually tire of it though and move on.   <br/>

say about 4 hours or so, is taken up with one of her activities.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re doing great as far as stretching yourselves and your <br/>
previous concepts of gaming etc.   My dd finished 6th grade in June, <br/>
shortly thereafter discovered World of Warcraft (computer game with <br/>
online play, real time, previously she was playing Runecape, kinda <br/>
the same but likes WOW better).  We got her the game around the end <br/>
of June and she has done the SAME thing as your dd, (she sleeps &#39;til <br/>
noon (give or take, &quot;until I&#39;m done sleeping&quot; as she puts it!)), then <br/>
is on the game from the moment she gets up until she goes to bed at <br/>
night (except for food, bathroom etc...lol!).  I&#39;ve &quot;let&quot; her <br/>
(because I too had the problem with it) do this all summer (and it&#39;s <br/>
part of our deschooling process, I see healing, it&#39;s really working - <br/>
she says sometimes things like  &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re letting me do <br/>
this so much&quot; or &quot;thanks for getting me this game&quot; etc etc).  I do <br/>
the same thing as you sometimes, sit with her as she plays, asking <br/>
questions, or she&#39;ll come to me and say &quot;I want to show you something <br/>
I found on WOW&quot; etc.  I&#39;m amazed at what she has accomplished in the <br/>
game (the levels she&#39;s attained etc etc) and the things she can tell <br/>
me about it.   I &quot;worried&quot; that she was NEVER going to want to do <br/>
anything else, but kept it to myself, posted here, emailed unschooler <br/>
friends, etc, ANYTHING but interfere with her absorption (and that&#39;s <br/>
in the GOOD sense of the word!), TRUSTING that she will evolve on her <br/>
own, in her own time, to other things etc etc.   Just this past week <br/>
(so let&#39;s see, it&#39;s been almost 3 months she&#39;s been playing, except <br/>
for a couple of camping trips with no access to it) she&#39;s started to <br/>
branch off, take a break from it here and there.   She&#39;s still very <br/>
into the game, but she&#39;s not DONE with it, not that I mean she&#39;ll be <br/>
DONE in the sense that she&#39;ll have had her fill and never play again, <br/>
if that makes sense, and maybe DONE is the wrong word (I&#39;ll have to <br/>
think on what I mean to say about that for a while!).   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not working for the FIRST time ever (and had foot surgery in <br/>
June) so I planned all this to also be able to have time for recovery <br/>
from the surgery and to do some &quot;deworking&quot; (!) myself (harder than I <br/>
thought!).   We talk about her not being in school, what she thinks <br/>
it will be like, etc etc, she&#39;s sometimes said &quot;I wonder when I&#39;ll <br/>
want to do something different&quot; and I&#39;ve said &quot;You&#39;ll just know&quot; - <br/>
she&#39;s still got a lot of programming in her thought process because <br/>
of school that will take time to erase (and it will vary from child <br/>
to child).   I also told her that come fall, and when the local <br/>
homeschooling group starts doing things, I want to go meet some of <br/>
the people I&#39;ve only emailed or talked to on the phone, maybe go to <br/>
an event they plan that appeals to us or her, do some things (now <br/>
that my foot is better, I was unable to walk a lot before from an <br/>
injury) during the beautiful New England fall weather (our favorite <br/>
season!) and she agreed.   So we do get out for a few hours here and <br/>
there, volunteering right now a few times to help someone who&#39;s <br/>
fostering cats and kittens for local shelters in socializing them, so <br/>
they get used to many different people and will be more adoptable <br/>
(most were ferral moms with kittens etc).   And we&#39;re meeting more <br/>
and more UNSCHOOLERS, at first it seemed like there weren&#39;t any <br/>
nearby but that&#39;s changing (we&#39;re the only ones in our town that I <br/>
know of).<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s hard to trust the process, but she will move on.  I haven&#39;t seen <br/>
much of it YET (except for the little moments I wrote above) but I <br/>
TRUST that it will happen as she recovers from being told what to do <br/>
when because of school, when she knows that I won&#39;t MAKE her <br/>
do &quot;schooly&quot; stuff, as I continue to treat her with respect, listen <br/>
to her opinions, discuss issues with her, really try to see her point <br/>
of view and not just tell her how I think she SHOULD feel, or how she <br/>
should handle something that comes up with a friend etc (oh yeah, she <br/>
does talk on the phone with friends sometimes too!) etc etc.   <br/>
Children learn to be respectful (and therefore, sometimes, more <br/>
willing to do something along with you that YOU are interested in <br/>
that involves leaving the house) when you treat them with respect.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re doing great.  Keep reading!   I need my daily maintenance <br/>
dose!  (it&#39;s less &quot;painful&quot; now, the sides of the &quot;box&quot; have holes in <br/>
them, so it&#39;s easier to get outside of it!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-993047777">Relax.  When my oldest (now 14) was given free reign over the tv, she literally watched tv for 4 months, all day, every day.  She did stop to eat and would eventually go to bed.  It was painful to watch.<br/>
<br/>
Now 2 years later, she will occassionally rent a movie or watch while I give her a foot massage, but never more than an hour or 2.<br/>
<br/>
We have 5 tv&#39;s, 2 dvd players, a computer, a PS2.  One kid is out of the house and the other 4 are outside playing.....having figured out that Ziploc bags can be used as whoopie cushions &lt;sigh,grin&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-136349309">If you truly continue to trust her, it will all work<br/>
out.  You already showed in your post that she played<br/>
her PS2 literally all day at first and now that has<br/>
decreased.  Chances are, it will further decrease,<br/>
BUT, please don&#39;t hold your breathe for that day.  Her<br/>
PS2 may be her main activity for a long time to come. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Continue to enjoy each day with her -- take an<br/>
interest in what she plays, play with her.  Keep her<br/>
environment rich and interesting...always have lots of<br/>
different things available to her.  You could also<br/>
suggest other, more active activities on occasion:<br/>
hiking, swimming, jumping on the trampoline,<br/>
rollerblading/skating, bike riding, etc.  But when<br/>
suggesting, don&#39;t look at it as a way to get her away<br/>
from the PS2, but rather just another activity you<br/>
think she might enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
And VERY GOOD on getting rid of your &quot;one weekend a<br/>
month&quot; PS2 rule! <br/>
