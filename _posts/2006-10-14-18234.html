<div id="ygrps-yiv-596965420">I had a daisy troop and then a brownie troop for two years. We met in a church, which was really weird for me, but after a while the atmosphere faded into the background. I don&#39;t think I was an unschooler back then, but the troop was definitely open and expereimental. I had no clue what I was doing so I just brought a lot of stuff from home (dress up stuff, paint, clay, puppets, our cat, etc.) and we played a lot. We also had a camp out and planted some flowers for a park in the neighborhood. We put on a play (entirely improvisational) for the parents. I remember also getting together with another troop for a car wash. We ate snacks and chatted. We did what we wanted to do, with the exception of singing one song at the end of every meeting that was sort of &quot;required&quot; I guess. (&quot;Make new friends, but keep the old, one is silver and the other gold.&quot;)&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I think it can be whatever you want it to be, with the girls&#39; input. My daughter, who was five years old when I had the daisy troop, was full of great ideas for things to do, and some of the other moms and daughters also gave suggestions. I don&#39;t know if I agree with Melissa, unless you find yourself dealing with the &quot;Little League&quot; kind of parent who has some rigid expectations of what you&#39;re doing. Maybe send out a little flyer to the parents beforehand letting them know that this is not going to be an achievement oriented thing, but a fun get together and work together time for you and the girls.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714116560">My suggestion is limited parent evolvement such as providing snacks or<br/>
assisting with crafts. My mother did things very unschooling for us. We had<br/>
opening which differed as we got older but was still opening, then an<br/>
activity that we either participated or not, snack/drinks and closing. For a<br/>
first meeting it would be a good idea to have the girls do an all about me<br/>
type thing that can be done as a group or individual. This way you can get<br/>
an idea about their interests which will help you see what kind of<br/>
patches/badges they want to work on. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My mother never said we are going to work on this. she just planned the<br/>
activities that followed the requirements. She never had a girl who didn&#39;t<br/>
fulfill enough of the requirements and everyone always got at least one<br/>
patch/badge at the end ceremony. Even though I don&#39;t do scouts, I organize a<br/>
lot of group activities and my mom laughs that I still use her techniques<br/>
and activities that I learned in scouts. Little tricks to get the kids to do<br/>
what needs to be done or explain it easier so that we can do things easier.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you have any trainings available to you from your local council check <br/>
them out. The GS program is more flexible than the BSs are (I have <br/>
both). GS specifically has &quot;unschooly&quot; goals: empowerment, giving girls <br/>
choices, exposing them to new experiences and &quot;wider opportunities&quot; <br/>
(tho&#39; they changed the name of that program to &quot;Destinations&quot;). GS also <br/>
specifically say that any requirements can be changed or substituted. <br/>
Each council makes up its own programs, too (including training) but <br/>
many councils have their training materials available on the web as <br/>
well. So if your council doesn&#39;t have program-specific stuff that you <br/>
need, look around. The council I had my troop in had some good training <br/>
materials for each level (Daisy, Brownie, etc.) Included were tips on <br/>
how to implement their &quot;girl led&quot; philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
I have the training booklets in .pdf format, I think. Email me privately <br/>
if you need them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is true. You can&#39;t do extra fund-raising if you don&#39;t do cookie  <br/>
sales. That&#39;s because the cookie money goes partly to the troop but  <br/>
also partly to pay for the organization&#39;s expenses for personnel,  <br/>
centers, and camping facilities. The individual troop fundraising  <br/>
doesn&#39;t contribute to the organization&#39;s expenses. Since we USE the  <br/>
organization&#39;s facilities extensively - that always seemed totally  <br/>
fair to me. The difference between Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts is that  <br/>
Boy Scouts gets LOTS of funding from corporations and grown up boy  <br/>
scouts who are now CEO&#39;s, etc., of major corporations. Because of the  <br/>
reality that women are still not commonly found in such positions,  <br/>
Girl Scouts doesn&#39;t have nearly as much of that kind of funding.<br/>
<br/>
But - the cookies are really easy to sell. We don&#39;t usually try to  <br/>
sell to friends, relatives, neighbors. We just get a &quot;booth sale&quot; slot  <br/>
at a grocery store or other business. We put the cookies on a table  <br/>
and the girls stand near the exits and say, &quot;Would you like to buy  <br/>
some Girl Scout Cookies?&quot; Lots of people are really thrilled when they  <br/>
see Girl Scout Cookies. Their eyes light up. Lots just ignore the  <br/>
girls, a handful are rude, most just say no thank you, but, really,  <br/>
there are plenty of people who are very very happy to buy them - they  <br/>
look FORWARD to them, they say.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Shill&quot; is a pretty strong word to use - it actually means that  <br/>
someone is faking being an eager customer in order to con others into  <br/>
buying a product.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you don&#39;t have to sell any particular number of boxes of  <br/>
cookies. If you sell just one box, that&#39;s considered &quot;participation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re lucky to have a fund-raiser that is so well-known and set up for  <br/>
us. We&#39;ve done lots of other fund-raising, over the years, but cookie  <br/>
sales are definitely the easiest and most lucrative for us. Over the  <br/>
past two years, my daughter&#39;s troop put a LOT of time into raising  <br/>
money for their cross-country train trip and to spend a week in  <br/>
Manhattan (including six Broadway shows). They collected recyclables,  <br/>
they put on a whole bunch of drop-off babysitting events (Drop and  <br/>
Shop - near a mall, during November and December, for example). They  <br/>
had garage sales. They sold magazine subscriptions. Cookie sale money  <br/>
swamped all the rest of the fund-raising put together.<br/>
<br/>
When the girls were younger, many of them LOVED standing out and  <br/>
selling cookies at the stores. The girls who didn&#39;t want to do it  <br/>
didn&#39;t do it. We always made it completely optional.<br/>
<br/>
Our expenses were very minimal with younger girls. We usually had dues  <br/>
- something like $1 per meeting for the younger girls. That was enough  <br/>
to cover the cost of supplies. Parents volunteered to bring snacks.  <br/>
Cookie sale money would be used for specific activities or events.<br/>
<br/>
When the girls get older, you can keep track of their fundraising  <br/>
individually - so my daughter raised enough through cookie sales and  <br/>
the other fund-raising activities to have about $500 credit toward our  <br/>
trip this year. Other girls might have had more or less.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about the whole process of having the kids raise money  <br/>
for their own activities. There are pros and cons to it, imo. It can  <br/>
clearly be taken too far, but it doesn&#39;t have to be. To some degree,  <br/>
the kids tend to enjoy it - my girls used to make up funny jingles and  <br/>
stand and sing in front of the stores when selling cookies. They had a  <br/>
blast. We&#39;d never do it if it wasn&#39;t enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
  But, also, there was something more - something more difficult to  <br/>
put a name on. There is a holistic nature to a well-run program - the  <br/>
girls decide what they want to do, plan it, get together whatever is  <br/>
needed, including raising money for it, and do it. They don&#39;t do all  <br/>
of those things all by themselves, of course, but they have some level  <br/>
of involvement in them all. It is different than just &quot;showing up&quot; and  <br/>
having an activity all planned out and ready. That can be good, too,  <br/>
but the ones that the girls have worked toward, themselves, really  <br/>
seem to be more valuable to them.<br/>
<br/>
If all I said above sound like a defense of Girl Scouts, I should say  <br/>
that if I had it to do over again, though, we&#39;d probably have moved  <br/>
toward more involvement in 4H and maybe not done Girl Scouts. We did  <br/>
do 4H for about 4 years - mostly horse stuff, but also some other  <br/>
projects. I really think that the way it is organized is awesome for  <br/>
unschoolers. In 4H you pick what you&#39;re interested in (or offer what  <br/>
you have expertise in) and you meet with a group to work on that  <br/>
particular interest. You do meet with the entire club, usually once a  <br/>
month for a meeting and other times for service projects or other  <br/>
group activities. But, anyway, I like the way it is all organized  <br/>
around experiential learning and exploring new interests and  <br/>
supporting existing interests. The 4H projects can be pretty much  <br/>
anything - I started out thinking it was all animal-related, but, no,  <br/>
I ended up running a drama project and my daughter did photography,  <br/>
leather working, arts and crafts, gardening, and much more. Mostly she  <br/>
was there for the horsemanship, so that was our focus. But there were  <br/>
LOTS of service projects and I found those to be very gratifying.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing - while Girl Scouts often doesn&#39;t appeal to the older  <br/>
girls so much, 4H seems to get better as they get older.<br/>

popular, because that is the part of being a girl scout I remember <br/>
liking the least. Not only are people disappointed since I&#39;ve been <br/>
taking a breather from leading a troop because they can&#39;t get the <br/>
cookies, but the girls are disappointed, too! When I talked about <br/>
getting back into GS they both said, &quot;will we be able to sell cookies?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And even though I don&#39;t remember cookie selling fondly, I learned a lot <br/>
about talking to people, putting myself out there, and that I could <br/>
succeed. The experience (back then we went door-to-door) helped me <br/>
tremendously later in life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911316168">Girl Scouts can by as &quot;unschooly&quot; (is that a word?) as you and the girls<br/>
choose.  Girl Scouts provides programs and incentives that you can<br/>
choose to use, or not.  Recently, GSUSA has undergone a huge remodling<br/>
to focus on promoting building girl leadership.  As a result, there are<br/>
now a variety of pathways, some of which are still in development.<br/>
<br/>
Girls can choose to join a troop, or not.   They can instead attend<br/>
programs independently, or they might join a camp, or the upcoming<br/>
virtual option.<br/>
<br/>
GSUSA has also developed great new materials that make it easier to<br/>
encourage girl-driven activities.  There are Journeys for each age level<br/>
that will spell things out for you, if you need it.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, as a leader, your goal is to find out what your girls are<br/>
interested in doing.  They may want to do service activities, or outdoor<br/>
exploration, or crafts, or whatever.   The leader is a facilitator, not<br/>
a director.  In a way, it&#39;s more difficult to back off and let the girls<br/>
lead, but that&#39;s what make for a great girl scout experience.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a GS leader since my daughter was in 1st Grade, and she is<br/>
going into 7th now.  The past year has been a huge transition year,<br/>
where we&#39;ve been figuring out how to encourage the girls to take the<br/>
initiative.  This is an ongoing process, and I&#39;m sharing our experience<br/>
on my On Living By Learning blog at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://onlivingbylearning.com">http://onlivingbylearning.com</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067102906">When I was a scout (for a veerrry short time), I remember selling cookies<br/>
which sold themselves because it&#39;s like people waited for them and bought<br/>
&#39;em up like they were going out of style.  My folks were reluctant about me<br/>
selling stuff and I&#39;m not sure why.. because I didn&#39;t ask.  They might not<br/>
remember why now.<br/>
<br/>
And... I&#39;ll write another thread for that boy scout question I have.<br/>

&gt; &gt; One thing that aggravated MIL (she and a friend ran a Daisy/Brownie/GS<br/>

&gt; &gt; sales - if you didn&#39;t participate in the cookie sale fund raising, you<br/>
&gt; &gt; were not *allowed* to participate in any other fund raising activities.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Which meant either you do without those resources that funds make<br/>
&gt; &gt; available OR you shill the ever shrinking high priced cookies.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was surprised when I became a leader that the cookie sale is so<br/>
&gt; popular, because that is the part of being a girl scout I remember<br/>
&gt; liking the least. Not only are people disappointed since I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; taking a breather from leading a troop because they can&#39;t get the<br/>
&gt; cookies, but the girls are disappointed, too! When I talked about<br/>
&gt; getting back into GS they both said, &quot;will we be able to sell cookies?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And even though I don&#39;t remember cookie selling fondly, I learned a lot<br/>
&gt; about talking to people, putting myself out there, and that I could<br/>
&gt; succeed. The experience (back then we went door-to-door) helped me<br/>
&gt; tremendously later in life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401481669"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;My dd is going to be in Girl Scouts this year and I am officially  the <br/>

So my question is, does anyone have an idea on how to make GS  an <br/>
unschooly experience. We are doing it at the public school which I have  <br/>
some reservations about, but for this year it will work. I am hoping to  <br/>
have parent involvment but I have been told not to expect it because a  <br/>
lot of parents won&#39;t make the time:(. Overall I want the girls to get  <br/>
the experience they want and have fun. <br/>
So any ideas?? :)&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m going to forward this to my wife, who has worked for the Girl Scouts  for <br/>
over 14 years AND is a dedicated unschooler. There are lots of unschooled  <br/>
Girl Scouts, and while GS has lots of ideas and materials, there&#39;s certainly no  <br/>
reason that it has to be schooly. I know Pam Soorashian&#39;s daughters have <br/>
loved  GS, and Jessica Harmon is still active at 15. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382600930">I think the rub was that it was MANDATORY with an &quot;or else&quot; attached<br/>
rather than saying &quot;here are the 6 fund raiser options for the year.<br/>
Pick whatever you want to do. The first X% of funds raised go to the<br/>
organization, the rest to the troop&quot;. Not to mention that at the time<br/>
(some 10 or more years ago), the sight of girl scouts, cheerleaders, etc<br/>
standing at a table outside the grocery store was unusual - the only<br/>
folks who did that much was the Salvation Army Santas around the<br/>
holidays. It&#39;s only in more recent years that the &#39;booth&#39; sales have<br/>
become common. Back then, it was hit up all your neighbors, friends,<br/>
relatives and co-workers. (And, FWIW, there weren&#39;t a lot of<br/>
&#39;facilities&#39; really, occasional local field trips but that&#39;s about it)<br/>
