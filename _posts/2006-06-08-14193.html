reading the provisions for *all* college bound persons you will see<br/>
where you don&#39;t need a formal education to qualify for financial aid.<br/>
If you google &quot;michigan financial aid&quot; you will get several hits<br/>
including:<br/>

 which doesn&#39;t have anything about educational requirements.  To<br/>
actually gain the aid you must be accepted to a college or other<br/>
qualified program of study.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925736983">She&#39;s really too young to be worrying about it - so you might be  <br/>
better off just reassuring her that lots of unschooled kids choose,  <br/>
later, to go to college IF it is what they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
But in a few years, if she&#39;s a real gung-ho &quot;I want to go to college  <br/>
next year&quot; kind of kid - then you might look at college extension  <br/>
courses and community college courses.<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of ways unschooled kids can get into college -  <br/>
I&#39;ve known kids who have:<br/>
<br/>
1. Had really interesting and relevant life experiences that  <br/>
impressed admissions officers enough to let him/her in without the  <br/>
academic background usually expected<br/>
2. Written a fantastic essay that caught the admission officer&#39;s  <br/>
attention, got the applicant an interview in which he wowed the  <br/>
admissions people enough to let him in, again without any real  <br/>
academic background.<br/>
3. Scored super high on the SAT and SAT2 exams - high enough to get  <br/>
in without having to meet any course/grade requirements.<br/>
4. Took a smattering of community college or university extension  <br/>
courses - enough to convince the admissions people that the applicant  <br/>
was capable of doing really well in college work.<br/>
5. Took (usually over a period of more than 2 years) community  <br/>
college work that qualified the applicant to transfer to a university  <br/>
as a junior, with all his/her general education requirements already  <br/>
completed. When they do this, nobody cares about high school anymore  <br/>
- since they&#39;ve got a couple of years of college, that&#39;s what the  <br/>
college looks at.<br/>
<br/>
Transcripts can be very different from what people usually think -   <br/>
they can include anything you think might be relevant and are not  <br/>
just a list of courses and grades (although for a college application  <br/>
it is useful to have some courses with a non-parent giving grades -  <br/>
but you don&#39;t have to WORRY about that until the child IS very close  <br/>
to college age).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628005407">Thanks Pam for the info. She is really too young to be worrying about college <br/>
- it&#39;s probably coming from her best friend who is homeschooled with a strict <br/>
curriculum. That and I think she&#39;s been thinking about trying to do some sort <br/>
of college extension/community college type courses as you mentioned when she <br/>
is old enough. An unschooling family friend of ours has a son who is 16 and <br/>
was taking some classes at a community college recently so that&#39;s got her all <br/>
fired up about it also. I told her if he can do it, so can you so not to worry.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

  Many colleges have provisions for *homeschooled* students. Unschoolers <br/>
fall under that heading. Most would fall under the &quot;alternatively <br/>
educated&quot; section.<br/>
<br/>
 In SC, I can make a diploma for Cameron, if he were to ever need one.<br/>
<br/>
 There are LOTS of books on forensics.<br/>
<br/>
  She could do some of her own experiments with chicken carcasses she <br/>
*plants* out in the fields/woods/ground. See how the tissues break <br/>
down. Do her own chicken necropsies. Keep records, photos, notebooks.<br/>
<br/>
 Spend some time volunteering at a vet&#39;s or---better! at a vet school.<br/>
<br/>
 Get her a really good microscope---the best you can afford.<br/>
<br/>
  Get to know your local coroner---maybe interview him for a <br/>
newspaper/magazine article. Then invite him for supper! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 Visit websites.<br/>
<br/>
  THEN: put together an *awesome* portfolio on the subject to submit as <br/>
her &quot;transcript&quot; to a good forensic college. And don&#39;t go to the <br/>
admissions office: go to the head of the forensic department. Wow them <br/>
with her knowledge, initiative, and passion.<br/>
<br/>
  This goes for whatever a child&#39;s passion is. LIVE that passion. <br/>
Colleges eat that up!<br/>

heads for sale although that is a bit gross to me.  I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
saying, &quot;Hey kids, let&#39;s go burry a pig&#39;s head and see what happens.<br/>
My neighbors would surely call the cops on me then ROFLOL!!!!  And if<br/>
a chicken carcass isn&#39;t available you could always try something<br/>
smaller like a mouse or frog or go hunting for road kill.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, I didn&#39;t think there were *provisions* for *unschooled kids!<br/>
&gt; &gt; * Our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 12 yo<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was questioning me recently about her fears that she &quot;Might not<br/>
&gt; &gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; able to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; into colleges without a diploma or equivalent.&quot; She is very much<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wanting to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get into something within the field of forensics and she&#39;s got<br/>
&gt; &gt; college<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; brain. I just wanted to find a few resources to ease her fears a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the info. on the subject!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; -=-=-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Many colleges have provisions for *homeschooled* students.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unschoolers<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fall under that heading. Most would fall under the &quot;alternatively<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; educated&quot; section.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In SC, I can make a diploma for Cameron, if he were to ever need<br/>
&gt; &gt; one.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are LOTS of books on forensics.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; She could do some of her own experiments with chicken carcasses<br/>
&gt; &gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; *plants* out in the fields/woods/ground. See how the tissues break<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; down. Do her own chicken necropsies. Keep records, photos,<br/>
&gt; &gt; notebooks.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Spend some time volunteering at a vet&#39;s or---better! at a vet<br/>
&gt; &gt; school.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Get her a really good microscope---the best you can afford.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Get to know your local coroner---maybe interview him for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; newspaper/magazine article. Then invite him for supper! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Visit websites.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; THEN: put together an *awesome* portfolio on the subject to<br/>
&gt; &gt; submit as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; her &quot;transcript&quot; to a good forensic college. And don&#39;t go to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; admissions office: go to the head of the forensic department. Wow<br/>
&gt; &gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with her knowledge, initiative, and passion.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This goes for whatever a child&#39;s passion is. LIVE that passion.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Colleges eat that up!<br/>

Chicken Cacciatore<br/>
BBQ chicken<br/>
Chicken & dumplings<br/>
Chicken Noodle Soup<br/>
Roasted chicken and potatoes<br/>
(The last two involve cooking the whole chicken so that leaves a cooked carcass, not especially good for measuring rates of decomposition.)<br/>

***Oh my gosh! Now you&#39;re sounding like my dd! LOL! (I&#39;m going to show her <br/>
your post! Great response btw!) Only on an unschooling list would you read this <br/>
sort of post and not think the kid and/or the parents were just plain weirdo&#39;s <br/>
or something! &lt;grin&gt; <br/>
We just had something come in our coop the other night and kill every one of <br/>
our chickens. She was angry (we liked those chickens a lot:o) but also <br/>
curious. (so, she&#39;s already got the chickens for her &quot;chicken necropsies&quot;:o) We&#39;re <br/>
guessing that it was probably a raccoon since they just killed them and really <br/>
didn&#39;t eat them. (although I&#39;m not exactly sure how he got in there) They can <br/>
be nasty little critters at times. We live out in the country and down the road <br/>
a bit is a place where there aren&#39;t any houses, last year some hunters threw <br/>
out a bunch of deer carcasses that they had butchered. She was sad for the <br/>
deer but fascinated with their skeletons etc. She asked me to pull over so we <br/>
could get out and take a look, what fun that was. That is definitely NOT my or my <br/>
other dd&#39;s idea of a good time! &lt;g&gt; But we humored her just the same. She <br/>
watches CSI with her Dad a lot, I get grossed out and my younger dd gets scared <br/>
so she finds something else to do while it&#39;s on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937615815">Look for a kosher or fresh meat butcher. Sometimes they even have<br/>
heads for sale although that is a bit gross to me. I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
saying, &quot;Hey kids, let&#39;s go burry a pig&#39;s head and see what happens.<br/>
My neighbors would surely call the cops on me then ROFLOL!!!! And if<br/>
a chicken carcass isn&#39;t available you could always try something<br/>
smaller like a mouse or frog or go hunting for road kill.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
....Only with unschoolers! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
It all sounds gross to me too but somehow I ended up with a dd that loves <br/>
everything forensics! I always tell her she must have gotten that from her Dad <br/>
cuz it definitely didn&#39;t come from me! I am an animal lover big time and have <br/>
always hated seeing anything hurt, bloody or dead. We are all into guns, our <br/>
youngest and I love to shoot at targets though, NOT anything living! I think my <br/>
12 yo may even have the stomach for hunting someday. I was SO bummed about <br/>
that! I had to learn to shut my mouth a little bit on that topic. My dh is a <br/>
respectful, conscientious hunter and will teach her the same if she ends up <br/>
choosing to hunt like she has talked about. I still don&#39;t like it though.<br/>

  Several years ago a mom came on a different list and complained that <br/>
she didn&#39;t know how her daughter could get into vet school by <br/>
unschooling---without the required math and science and such.<br/>
<br/>
  I suggested that she pick up road kill and dissect it. Keep photos and <br/>
records and journals and all.<br/>
<br/>
 She said her daughter could/would *NEVER* do that!<br/>
<br/>
 I figured she wasn&#39;t *that* serious about vet school then. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  There are sooo many ways around things simply by being creative and <br/>
thinking outside the box. Had this girl picked up every dead critter <br/>
she&#39;d found on the road for four years and done a thorough dissection <br/>
and seriously and thoughtfully recorded it in detail, I doubt she would <br/>
have had any trouble getting accepted into the biology department of a <br/>
good college/university.<br/>
<br/>
  Oh! And can you imagine if she&#39;d gotten the meat off and brains out of <br/>
the skulls and tried to &quot;rebuild&quot; them with clay? COOL!<br/>
<br/>
  But someone afraid to get her hands dirty? She wouldn&#39;t get a second <br/>
look in a pre-vet department!<br/>
<br/>
  As unschoolers, we *need* to think outside the box---WAAAAY outside! <br/>
Be creative!!!<br/>

You are right! I don&#39;t think she was that serious either! <br/>
When my Dad was in college he had to dissect a human brain. (chiropractic <br/>
med.) While there, the donor brain for one of the students wasn&#39;t handled <br/>
properly and when it was opened, it had rotted. My Dad said it was the WORST thing he <br/>
had ever SMELLED AND SEEN in his life! It made all them pretty ill. He said <br/>
the college made them cancel that class for the next three days to get rid of <br/>
the smell before they would let them continue. He told me he thought that was <br/>
ridiculous and was ready to go back the next day. He was looking forward to <br/>
that brain he had! What a sicko!  There are times when you just have to want it <br/>
within every part of your being, guess for that girl, it just wasn&#39;t there.<br/>
