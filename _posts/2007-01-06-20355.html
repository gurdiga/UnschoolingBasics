<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918005">I am speaking from my experience as an adult that was unschooled. It was <br/>
just that, my own personal experience. My parents taught me a million little <br/>
things that I use every day in the advancement and betterment of my own <br/>
children. My parents, to my memory, never told me no. And for the most part, <br/>
that worked. But I personally wish they had said no to me more often because <br/>
in my day to day life now I hear it. In all fairness, I lived in a commune <br/>
for most of my early years and that isn&#39;t the same for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I belong to a group of adult unschool grads. This is a common issue that we <br/>
all share, not being prepared for people not to respect our opinion. When <br/>
put in a situation under authority it was/is a big adjustment for myself and <br/>
others. And when people told us,&quot;No.&quot;, it was really a shock to hear when no <br/>
explanation was offered. I have experienced and have heard that the ability <br/>
to say no is difficult when you didn&#39;t hear it as a child. I&#39;m certainly <br/>
willing to concede that it may be an isolated group. I only know what is <br/>
true for me.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned much about unschooling from these fellow unschooled adults. <br/>
Reserving the right to say ,&quot;No.&quot; without giving a detailed list, or even a <br/>
not so good reason is a simple reality for me. I want my children to <br/>
say,&quot;No.&quot; when they don&#39;t want to do something. And they don&#39;t always have <br/>
to give a reason and neither do I.<br/>
<br/>
We also encourage and practice sharing our feelings when someone tells us <br/>
,&quot;No.&quot; so that we don&#39;t use it as a crutch to be rude or lazy. We&#39;re a <br/>
huggy, feel good, bunch at my house, and we always try to at least be <br/>
conscience of each other feelings.<br/>
<br/>
In the concept that kids need to hear ,&quot;No.&quot;, for their own good. I don&#39;t <br/>
think you should find occasions to say, &quot;No.&quot; I think we both agree that <br/>
there is enough natural situations that &quot;No.&quot; happens.<br/>
<br/>
I really think we (Deb and I) are on a closer idea about this than appears. <br/>
Some words just have a bigger impact than others, but they are just words. I <br/>
respect your opinion and it has given me pause to re-examine my thought on <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
True Peace!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;***&quot;No.&quot; has a vast number of meanings given the context in which<br/>
&gt;it is said.***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The website referenced in the post to this list is about saying no to<br/>
&gt;children as in denying children the things they want, as in &quot;tell them NO<br/>
&gt;for their own good.&quot;   What are some of the vast meanings within that<br/>
&gt;context?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;***Again, if  children don&#39;t  learn to hear it used in the appropriate<br/>
&gt;context, they won&#39;t know to use it<br/>
&gt;that way.***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can think of no situation in which a hearing, English speaking child <br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt;never hear the word &quot;no.&quot;   Are you really saying you believe children must<br/>
&gt;be told &quot;no&quot; in order to understand the meaning of the word ?<br/>
