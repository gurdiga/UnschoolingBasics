<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085334785">Interesting how ever since I started learning about Unschooling<br/>
situations arise where I wonder how to best handle it.  I had a bunch of<br/>
them, hopefully they&#39;ll come back as I write them.<br/>
<br/>
First with regards to rules vs. principles. . .I get it.  I think. <br/>
Especially when older children are concerned, BUT how can there be<br/>
absolutely no &quot;rules&quot; with smaller children?  I have a 5 year-old and a<br/>
14 month-old.  My 5 year-old nephew was over yesterday and he and my<br/>
older daughter were playing, running around the house . . .I caught<br/>
myself reminding them to not play with doors.  Meaning, while they&#39;re<br/>
playing and running, I don&#39;t want doors being shut for fear of catching<br/>
fingers.  There&#39;s no way to make this safe that I can think of, thus a<br/>
&quot;rule&quot; of no shutting doors during play.  Now, I can say, &quot;Well, it&#39;s<br/>
not a rule, it&#39;s negotiating. . .running is ok as long as you don&#39;t shut<br/>
doors.&quot;  Isn&#39;t that just semantics?  In the end, it is a rule.  Now<br/>
granted, there&#39;s no consequence to &quot;breaking&quot; the rule such as time out,<br/>
but it may very well end the game (part of the negotiation).  Am I wrong<br/>
in concluding that with younger children there are a few &quot;rules&quot; that<br/>
may be necessary to cultivate principles?<br/>
<br/>
Second, today I took my kids to the park and were joined by one of her<br/>
friends.  We were parked side by side.  Upon leaving, the kids  jumped<br/>
into my van then went into my friend&#39;s van where her daughter offered my<br/>
daughter a stick of gum.  My daughter told her she wanted 2, but her<br/>
friend only wanted to give 1.  The friend&#39;s 4 year-old brother gave my<br/>
daughter a 2nd stick of gum against his sister&#39;s wishes, at which time,<br/>
my daughter high-tailed it back into our van, leaving her friend<br/>
hysterical.  The brother had a change of heart as he jumped into my van<br/>
forcefully taking back the 2nd stick of gum, leaving the stick mangled. <br/>
His sister, although grateful at having gotten back her gum, was still<br/>
hysterical because now she couldn&#39;t put it back into the sleeve in the<br/>
pack.  Hence, she demanded my daughter take the mangled stick and give<br/>
back the in tact one.  My daughter didn&#39;t want the mangled one.  At the<br/>
time, I thought the friend had given her 2, changed her mind, my<br/>
daughter didn&#39;t want to give back the 2nd one, which got mangled when<br/>
the brother took it back, and now wanted the in tact one back (history<br/>
supports this conclusion).  Her mother, also aware of history, assumed<br/>
the same, stepped in, forcefully removed her daughter from my van,<br/>
threatened with spanking and almost threw away the entire pack of gum to<br/>
get her daughter to stop crying.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that despite how quickly everything transpired, the entire<br/>
thing could have been avoided if I had been there right next to my<br/>
daughter the whole time (not talking with my friend or putting the baby<br/>
in the car seat).  But I wasn&#39;t there, so my question is this?  Let&#39;s<br/>
say the situation had been handled differently and after talking it out<br/>
we had all realized what we all now know, but my daughter still refused<br/>
to give back the gum?  Do I take it away from her to give back to her<br/>
friend?  How do you handle a situation where your child takes something<br/>
from someone who wants it back, but doesn&#39;t despite attempts to reason?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about approaching situations with the intent that all involved <br/>
can have their needs and wants met. That changes with each <br/>
situation. <br/>
<br/>
My daughters 4.5 and 3 both wanted the same lip gloss- Older one got <br/>
another lip gloss hoping to trade her siter who yelled no. I stepped <br/>
in and asked to hold both lip gloss- I held up the 2nd one and the <br/>
little one took it and the older one took the one she orignally <br/>
wanted. BOTH got their needs met though not in the conventional way <br/>
which would have had me giving the disputed one to the little one <br/>
and making the older sister take the new one but it was solved in <br/>
their own way.<br/>
<br/>
The door &quot;principle&quot; would be safety- they need to choose to not <br/>
slam the door when someone is chasing them but sometimes when my <br/>
husband is chasing me around the house I close to door to slow him <br/>
down. It is a fun game. Maybe just explaining that if it gets closed <br/>
on someones fingers it will hurt or heads or legs. Prop the doors <br/>
open so that they are less easy to close or something<br/>
<br/>
A lot of times I ask my daughters what they need or want in a <br/>
situation. After hearing each other they or we come up with ways <br/>
to &quot;work it out&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I step in too soon and my daughter says &quot;mom we are <br/>
working it out&quot; so I step back and let them follow the process.<br/>
<br/>
It took months of me contantly says &quot;lets find a way to work it out&quot; <br/>
and finding ways to help everyone get what they want. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628468313">Rules and principles<br/>
<br/>
I have a four year old daughter and I posed the bubblegum question to her:  If you want many bubblegum sticks and someone only gives you one, what do you do? Answer:  I&#39;ll get money and buy myself some more.<br/>
<br/>
That the friend even gave your daughter one bubblegum stick, shows me she likes to share. Having to give more than she was prepared to makes a child loath to do so next time and forcing her to share perpetrates her sense of ownership. YOU don&#39;t like others telling you what to do with your stuff. Children have as much a right to decide what to do with their property as you do.  Learning to accept a no is part of life. Learning how to handle it with grace is what you can teach your children by example.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding rules and principles, my mom and I talked about that and came to the obvious conclusion that rules grow out of principles. The principle of not hurting each other, taking care of each other, and being considerate of others needs may result in the rule of not slamming doors when fingers could be caught in them. The rule of not fighting at the table stems from the principle that stress while eating results in indigestion..  <br/>
The trick is not to make rules for the sake of having them, but to understand the principles behind them.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve enjoyed this extremly and thank my mom for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this discussion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why would &quot;rules&quot; be necessary? There&#39;s a difference between the <br/>
physical practical result of a principle and a rule, though it may <br/>
look the same - just like unschooling might on occasion look like <br/>
schooling if a particular individual child wants to explore using a <br/>
workbook for something. Looks the same, very different underneath. <br/>
Thus, when DS was 2, we absolutely always held hands in a parking <br/>
lot. It wasn&#39;t a rule - it was the safe thing to do. I knew it, he <br/>
knew it. And, in the process, a few things developed: (1) he held my <br/>
hand not vice versa - though I always had his wrist in my grasp in <br/>
case of emergency, his hand had the &quot;upper hand&quot; literally (2) we&#39;d <br/>
skip or hop or swing hands, generally enjoyable, close, affectionate <br/>
type stuff (3) he&#39;s 9 now and still prefers to hold my hand most of <br/>
the time, even on sidewalks, just because it&#39;s fun to be close. <br/>
Sometimes, I&#39;ll put my arm around his shoulders instead of holding <br/>
hands. (4) and sometimes he walks freely on his own across a parking <br/>
lot now - he has the info that white lights mean a car is backing <br/>
up - watch out - and all the other info an adult might have for the <br/>
situation. The thing is, we never had to change the &quot;rule&quot; as he <br/>
grew older. The practical aspect of the principle changed in <br/>
appearance but the principle never changed.<br/>
<br/>
This is just one example but maybe it&#39;ll help clarify things a <br/>
little (or not - I think I need another cup of coffee to get me <br/>
going after lunch)...<br/>
