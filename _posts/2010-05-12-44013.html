<div id="ygrps-yiv-219399294">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am studying a five day intensive course in Columbus in June and we live two hours away in Wheeling WV. Some of you who were at the waterpark might know us!<br/>
<br/>
Well it is far to be away from family and I am not sure whether to travel the two hours each way every day. So I wondered if any unschoolers would want to meet up with my husband and kids to play some of the time, so he could be near by so I can see/ nurse our 1yo. Or even whether any folks we know might be happy for me to stay with them and I could maybe set up a babysitting arrangement for my 1yo with an unschooler teen? Just throwing ideas out there!!<br/>
<br/>
Let me know!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508140559">What dates are you going to be there? I&#39;m possibly coming to Columbus from June 14th-18th (Mon-Fri) from Cleveland. If that&#39;s when you&#39;ll be there, let me know.<br/>
