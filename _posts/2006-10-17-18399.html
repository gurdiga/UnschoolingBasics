<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315333159">Hi.  I&#39;m new to your list.  I am a deschooled/unschooler in Madison,<br/>
WI.  The unschool support group to which I belong is planning the<br/>
first ever unschooling conference in Madison on Feb 10, 2007.  We are<br/>
very excited to be doing this and welcome inquiries.  Registration<br/>
information will be available after Nov 1st, at which time it is also<br/>
our goal to have a website up.<br/>
<br/>
This is our first conference, and it will be small, but we hope to grow.<br/>
We would love to have participants from throughout the Midwest.  For<br/>
more information you can contact The Unschooling Conference at<br/>

I&#39;ve been there for Wiscons (The only feminist science fiction writers<br/>
conventions) and love Madison!  It&#39;s gorgeous in the spring.  Would<br/>
love to see it in the winter.<br/>
