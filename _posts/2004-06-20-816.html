<div id="ygrps-yiv-257729688">Many a wise person has warned people to be aware of the fact that <br/>
what they read and see will change them. I believe this, though I <br/>
have not always. Funny how I would go to watch something thinking it <br/>
would not have an effect on me and then latter I found myself with <br/>
thoughts I did not have before and could no longer avoid. Even as an <br/>
adult I do not always know what I can handle. And I am not the only <br/>
one. <br/>
<br/>
 My husband, in my the military, military intel infact, spends 16 <br/>
hours of the day working double shifts doing things he can not tell <br/>
me. He has a passion for it. And yesterday I learned more why. He <br/>
told me that the terrorist had beheaded their hostage and sent a tape <br/>
if it to the news. Thats horrible I said, it made me sick think about <br/>
about. We talked about how it might feel to his family, wanting to <br/>
see it, but yet not. And then he told me the details of how they did <br/>
it. It was not the fast death I had in my mind. I will not share it <br/>
here, but I will say I wish I did not know. Hubby went on to tell me <br/>
with anger and tears in his eyes how he can not stop thinking about <br/>
it, how they are so close to catching the people who did it, and how <br/>
part of him wants to get online and see it. Wants to see it... he <br/>
thought maybe it would bring him closer on it all. After a lot of <br/>
talking, he desided it would cause himself more harm then good. It <br/>
took a grown adult days to make this choice.<br/>
<br/>
 So I am left thinking that my choice to gaurd my 4 year old from <br/>
certian channels and programs on TV for the moment is right. I am the <br/>
sheltering mother, the protecter. For the moment, what she does not <br/>
know she is missing will not hurt her. So HBO and other channels can <br/>
stay blocked for her and late night tv watching will have Mommy right <br/>
there like a lioness making sure it will not harm my little one. <br/>
<br/>
 I remember being little and my grandparents letting me watch The <br/>
Blob with them, oh if onky they hadn&#39;t I would have gotten a great <br/>
deal more sleep growing up! LOL <br/>
<br/>
  Blessings,<br/>

<br/>
P.S. Sorry if others do not agree, that is ok. I do not believe that <br/>
you have to cut away all limits to be an unchooler, I believe in <br/>
balance and moderation, not to make my life easier, but to provide a <br/>
healthy home for those I love.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949996">IMO I tend to agree with what you are saying.  I may be called overprotective <br/>
(and hopefully won&#39;t be called a true unschooler), but there are things on tv <br/>

learn whatever needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>

Hi, Kimmy,<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s been discussed on this list a lot that makes a ton of sense to me is<br/>
necessary limits versus arbitrary (knee jerk reaction) type limits.  So what<br/>
I try to do with my family is to question the limits I find myself setting<br/>
to find out what&#39;s behind them, and to discuss them with my family.<br/>
Sometimes the questioning reveals nothing behind it at all.  But in the case<br/>
of adult TV, which you bring up here, it is also a big concern of mine that<br/>
my kids may be exposed to and disturbed by adult content that is not their<br/>
choice, but is something my husband happens to have on so they look up and<br/>
see it because they are playing with him.  So I talk to my daughter at least<br/>
since she is 5.7 about the &quot;adult content TV&quot; that daddy watches, and what<br/>
types of things are on there, and she is actually the one who will often<br/>
make sure that her Dad isn&#39;t watching anything with that type of content on<br/>
while she is around (like the crime shows).  She very much enjoys watching<br/>
sports and shows like Survivor and Fear FActor with him - she loves the<br/>
challenges.  At some point as she gets older doubtless she&#39;ll get interested<br/>
in some of the other stuff, and we&#39;ll talk about what it is, any concerns I<br/>
have about the content, and she&#39;ll decide if and when she wants to try some<br/>
of it, and I&#39;ll be there to try it with her, talk to her, and support her.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869138658">I agree here.  We don&#39;t specifically limit what our kids can choose to see,<br/>
though I guess we limit what comes into the house b/c we don&#39;t have cable or<br/>
satellite, the kids are free to choose what they want for the most part.<br/>
However, they know they do not want to see the news on TV.  Used to be they<br/>
didn&#39;t like it because it seemed boring but neither of them want to see it<br/>
now because they&#39;ve seen enough disturbing ads for news programs. Trayton<br/>
will actually leap off his chair to turn it off or change the channel.  They<br/>
don&#39;t mind talking with us about news events and will even read the front<br/>
page of the newspaper but not on tv.  Too disturbing ( and I would ad<br/>
sensationalized and shallow)<br/>
<br/>
One time dd then 7 was at a friend&#39;s house when she saw a news report about<br/>
a local kidnapping/murder of a little girl.  The friends she was with stayed<br/>
glued to the tv for more reporting about it and the mom decided to make it a<br/>
&quot;see, that&#39;s why I tell you not to wander away from me at the mall&quot; lesson.<br/>
Not at all how I would have responded.  But after that dd would not be alone<br/>
in her bedroom ever.  It changed her little life.  She was scared to sleep<br/>
near a window etc.  Still is almost 2 years later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398189208">Surely you don&#39;t think we would we stand by and let our children be <br/>
harmed? That doesn&#39;t make sense, right?<br/>
<br/>
So - I think there is a gap between what some people are saying about <br/>
not having limits on tv and what others are imagining happens when <br/>
there are no limits.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we need to say that we substitute something else for &quot;limits.&quot; <br/>
Because otherwise it sounds like we just do nothing, which is far from <br/>
true. Having pre-established set limits would be easier than what we do <br/>
- I could just set limits (no shows on Fox network or HBO, one hour per <br/>
day maximum, only when your room is clean, etc.).  But without those <br/>
kinds of limits, I STILL care about what my kids are watching and still <br/>
want to not let them be harmed, right? So what do I do instead? A bunch <br/>
of things that are harder to talk about clearly than, &quot;Set limits.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Watch together, give good advice so the kids will trust my advice, <br/>
point out when things are about to get scary or inappropriate and maybe <br/>
fast forward or mute for a second, even send a kid out to get something <br/>
right then, NEVER do we watch tv news when kids are around - I don&#39;t <br/>
even like my dh to do it when I am around - I think that is cruel and <br/>
imposes something really shallow and awful on others, talk a LOT about <br/>
what is watched - talk about commercials, talk about sexual innuendo, <br/>
talk about violence and its effect on society, talk about how women are <br/>
portrayed, etc. Talk talk talk..... And - again - I will say to one of <br/>
my kids, &quot;No way - you don&#39;t really want to watch that - it&#39;ll totally <br/>
freak you out.&quot; The kid will say, &quot;Oh - well - hmmm.&quot; And much more <br/>
often than not, they&#39;ll find something else to do. If they REALLY want <br/>
to watch something - I might delay it a little (6 months can be a big <br/>
difference in readiness for some stuff) just by being busy - we ARE <br/>
busy. But eventually we&#39;ll watch it together.  If a kid wants to see <br/>
something that I&#39;m just SURE is a terrible idea - the kid will go along <br/>
with me, even if somewhat regretfully, because they know that I have a <br/>
very very good reason. And if there is something they still want BADLY <br/>
to see - I&#39;ll go along and watch with them, because then they must have <br/>
a very good reason, if they want to disregard my advice. My 13 yo is <br/>
the one who sometimes we do this with - because she really wants to see <br/>
something her sisters have seen and are talking a lot about, even <br/>
though we all tell her it might really upset her.<br/>
<br/>
I think the husband who described the beheading in such graphic detail <br/>
was cruel. I&#39;d have left the room almost immediately - I read the <br/>
headlines and the stories, but passed on video or graphic descriptions.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are very very selective about what they&#39;ll watch. But, even <br/>
though they have no specific externally imposed &quot;limits&quot; - meaning we <br/>
don&#39;t say, &quot;One hour per day,&quot; or &quot;Only public tv&quot; or whatever rules <br/>
people might have, it doesn&#39;t mean kids are making tv choices without <br/>
the guidance of their loving parents.<br/>
<br/>
-pam<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Unschooling tends to encourage people to question everything - <br/>
after all, when we realize that kids learn just beautifully without <br/>
schooling, it is natural to wonder if other things that children <br/>
supposedly &quot;need&quot; are really necessary. But unschooling just means not <br/>
doing &quot;school at home.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885664855">Pam, I never posted to cause conflict, but I think some people are <br/>
looking for it. My use of the world healthy was brought up, some <br/>
people that eating meat is not healthy. I am defining healthy in my <br/>
family differently then others. Clearly limits here is used as a <br/>
negative thing, I like them, like gaurd rails on the side of the <br/>
road. I can control how I drive for the most part, just as I trust <br/>
my daughter can chose well what she watches and reads, but neither <br/>
I, nor her, can control what others do, what just happens to be on <br/>
tv as she is flashing through channels. <br/>
<br/>
 By no means do I think that those parents chosing not to use the <br/>
word limit and it&#39;e effects as they see them, are any less good <br/>
parents. But everyone is different and not everything works for <br/>
everyone the same way. My daughter can watch Jurasic park with no <br/>
ill effects but the cartoon Monsters gives her nightmares! And to <br/>
top it off she will watch ANYTHING! She loves TV, no matter what is <br/>
on. I have to shange the channel tonight because I was watching <br/>
Salams Lot and she came in the living room sat down and started <br/>
watching too! Not something she needs to be seeing and there was no <br/>
talking to her about it, she is in the fighting everything phase. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  As for you calling my husband cruel... you have no idea! He is in <br/>
the army, he went to Iraq, he had a gun. Like is cruel. I am his <br/>
wife, and I expect him to share all of lifes shadows with me if they <br/>
are bothering him. He spared me a lot of details I am sure. The rest <br/>
of us can hide from the horror of it, but it is his job to know them <br/>
so that he can protect us from those people. I will be damned if he <br/>
has to sholder that burden alone. I am his wife, his equal, his <br/>
other half, it would be cruel of him not to share! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Let me make this clear, my post was to share what I have found to <br/>
be true about life, that all we read and see effects us, even if we <br/>
do not wish them to and that as a parent I am going to protect my <br/>
child as best I can from those things she is not yet ready to deal <br/>
with. <br/>
<br/>
   I do not think doing away with limits all together would work for <br/>
my family, because like me, and many others, my daughter feels <br/>
protected by them and safe. I will take the limits of the gaurd <br/>
rails on the road of life thanks.  <br/>
<br/>
  Blessings,<br/>
  Kimberly<br/>

P.S. Sorry if others do not agree, that is ok. I do not believe that<br/>
you have to cut away all limits to be an unchooler, I believe in<br/>
balance and moderation, not to make my life easier, but to provide a<br/>
healthy home for those I love.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good for you, Kimmy! Making these judgements is all part of being a good <br/>
parent, imo. <br/>
<br/>
Changing my mind to adjust for each kid -- that&#39;s the hard part.<br/>
<br/>
My personal example --<br/>
<br/>
DS watches everything. He is 11. He does not seem to be upset by any of it <br/>
and skips over the parts that he is not interested in -- like the smoochy parts <br/>
(although he does now know that women have breasts . . . hmmmmm . .. :) ).<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, there is DD. She is 9. If I am watching something I don&#39;t think is <br/>
appropriate for her, I will tell her &quot;This is a grown up show, I don&#39;t think you&#39;d <br/>
like it.&quot; And she goes off to whatever she should have been doing -- which is <br/>
usually going to bed because it&#39;s late enough that I am watching a movie.<br/>
<br/>
But the thing is -- it&#39;s a self-regulating sort of thing. She genuinely does <br/>
not want to watch a lot of the things my son is intrigued with. Car crashes <br/>
and all that -- just no fun for her, it seems. Gross humor -- not her thing. <br/>
<br/>
So my little warning is more of a courtesy heads up to her, not a &quot;you can&#39;t <br/>
watch this&quot; statement. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway -- that&#39;s how it feels here as we wend our way toward adolescence in a <br/>
TV-filled house. If I explained it all clearly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150619184">I don&#39;t know what to do about my situation today.  My son age 4 has been<br/>
asking a lot recently about where things are made, and he&#39;s been seeing<br/>
the visits to various factories on Mr. Rogers, so we have talked a lot<br/>
about the toilet paper factory that is just around the corner from our<br/>
house.  He has said several times that he wants to see it.  So last week<br/>
I emailed them and asked about a tour.  They wrote back and were<br/>
thrilled to have us come, and we set it up for today at 3:00.  When I<br/>
told my son we could go he was thrilled, he said &quot;OK, let&#39;s go!&quot;  and I<br/>
said well it won&#39;t be until next week and he was bummed.  Then the lady<br/>
wrote me and said that we would need to wear hair nets while there.<br/>
Well, I knew he would be resistant to the idea so I told him about it in<br/>
order to give him plenty of time to get used to it, and I even bought<br/>
some hair nets so he could see what they were, explained why we need to<br/>
wear them, etc.  But he now says he doesn&#39;t want to go and it&#39;s looking<br/>
like he&#39;s going to resist pretty strongly.  He says he&#39;s afraid of the<br/>
people there and the noise of the machines.  I know that what he is<br/>
really afraid of is the unknown.  He is always wary of new situations<br/>
but once he&#39;s in them he adjusts fairly quickly and winds up having a<br/>
great time.  I know he would love to see the machinery.  He absolutely<br/>
loves that kind of stuff.<br/>
 <br/>
So I don&#39;t know what to do.  I&#39;ve talked to him about his fears, and<br/>
reminded him of how he usually has a good time once he&#39;s there, and told<br/>
him that once we are there and we&#39;ve seen a little bit if he still<br/>
doesn&#39;t like it we can leave.  He&#39;s digging in his heels.  I don&#39;t want<br/>
to force him, yet I really feel compelled to go through with it,<br/>
especially because they have been so generous in setting it up for us,<br/>
AND my husband has scheduled time off from work to watch the baby while<br/>
we go.  <br/>
 <br/>
Aaaaaah, I&#39;m so frustrated!!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have dealt with this kind of thing, too, in the past. I suggest you <br/>
don&#39;t talk about going on the tour - or about wearing the hair nets or <br/>
the loud machines or any of that. Just say, &quot;Let&#39;s just go and see what <br/>
the place looks like inside the door. We can leave any time we want.&quot; <br/>
Then - when there, &quot;Let&#39;s just look at a little bit. We can leave when <br/>
we want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And - remember - you CAN leave.<br/>
<br/>
If he seems to have had enough - that&#39;s what you say to the person <br/>
giving you a tour.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;THANK you so much - this was so great. This has been just enough for <br/>
him...given him a lot of new information and input. I think any more <br/>
would be too much for him, for right now.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148856538">I don&#39;t think you should make him go if he doesn&#39;t want to.  You can <br/>
explain to him that you set it up because he expressed interest in <br/>
it, that it is not something he will have the opportunity to do <br/>
again for awhile and you are concerned he will be disappointed if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t go.  But if he is resistant, then don&#39;t go.  A huge factory <br/>
might be overwhelming for a 4yo. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226570128">:-)  Yes, young children can be a cause of  fustration at times.   I remember being frustrated when I paid $ for swimming lessons and my dd would not get anywhere near the pool.   When I finally flip my emotional switch, relaxed and gave up on the lessons [and the $}  She naturally jumped in and started swimming underwater to retrive toys!!!<br/>
&lt;arrgh!&gt; <br/>
<br/>
{{Relax and enjoy your son}}<br/>
 It&#39;s OK.   He is very young and there will be plenty of other times for him to go places.  <br/>
At least he knows you did set it up for him and that a trip is possible.  That in itself is an eye opener.   Try again next year.  <br/>
<br/>
The people at the factory will not mind you canceling, just tell them he is 4 and Thank Them  for their time.      <br/>
You can not help it if a child balks at the last min.   He will or he won&#39;t.   People &#39;in charge&#39; should know kids change their minds {{ You and he are the only ones you need to answer to}}  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If your husband wants to take care of the baby so your son could go w you for an educational outing, maybe go to a muesum.  <br/>
<br/>
Is there a local ice cream shop where you might walk through their kitchen?   These smaller places are like normal kitchens w only a few big machines and a treat at the end.   In reality,  even  huge icecream plants no longer allows you to get close to the machines anymore.  It can be a disappointment.   The one we went to had a viewing hall sperarating us from the work space w glass.  <br/>
<br/>
As an older mom, one thing I might suggest is you  concider  not giving your son too much advanced info.  He wanted to go.  As it got cloesr to time he played it over too much in his mind and it &#39;scared&#39; him.  Making a big deal of something, like hair nets and noisy machines gives him permission to for him to  react.  Let Mr Roger&#39;s do the job of sparking your son&#39;s interest and let the factory tour person hand out the hairnet.  The fun of the factory will take over.  <br/>
<br/>
One example was when my oldest child was 3, she was a biter.  I read many books on how to stop her from biting and tried many things.  including getting mean.   Then I read an article in Dr Spock ..Nothing in it worked, except  turning the page...There was ONE  small paragraph that stated:  &quot;There are some children for which none of these ideas will work   In those cases, you need to stop talking about it.  When a child bites you can talk about how it hurt the other person and what the child was feeling when she bit  but the NEXT day DO NOT mention it.  do not say, &quot;Don&#39;t bite anyone today&quot; as you are walking out the door because what she hears is &quot; ...Bite anyone today&quot;  I kept my mouth shut and almost immediately  her  biting was over.  <br/>

<br/>
If it were Jayn (4.5) expressing these feelings, we would not go. On the few<br/>
occasions that I have tried the approach that Pam suggested of taking Jayn<br/>
somewhere in a kind of gentle surprise, the result has not been positive.<br/>
She has generally rebelled in the car, when we parked, and we have always<br/>
left almost at once.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, when I have told her at home that we need not go if she doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to, sometimes she has thought about it again and changed her mind. &quot;Well, I<br/>
guess I could go&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
There have been times when she has balked at the rules of an establishment,<br/>
in your case the hairnets. We have sat silently (getting the staff to be<br/>
quiet and leave us alone instead of cajoling and jollying her being the<br/>
hardest task!) and given her a chance to either comply in her own time or be<br/>
happy to leave *without recriminations*. Usually she has decided to follow<br/>
the rule.<br/>
<br/>
You may end up having to have a family day with DH instead. Shucks ;) <br/>
<br/>
The folks at the factory will understand. It is no different from if you had<br/>
a sudden illness or household emergency and had to cancel. In fact I would<br/>
probably call and apologize without going into detail about why. Is there<br/>
someone else in your local area or homeschool support group who could go in<br/>
your stead?<br/>

it&#39;s easier to read:<br/>
<br/>
1) Stop controling what your kids watch and...<br/>
<br/>
2) Start influencing (not manipulating!) what they watch and why. <br/>
Have conversations (when they want to) about shows, the making of <br/>
shows, the affect of sitting still vs. running around the backyard, <br/>
etc. and you will find...<br/>
<br/>
3) Changes in yourself: less worried and grumpy about how much tv the <br/>
kids watch and more enjoyment of what they watch, more understanding <br/>
of their likes and dislikes, etc. (I&#39;m blanking on good examples <br/>
here) and you will see...<br/>
<br/>
4) Changes in your kids: tv is something they can take or leave so <br/>
they&#39;ll turn off a show in the middle to do something fun with you! <br/>
And so on...<br/>
<br/>
I could do the same for controling what kids eat. Once I loosened up, <br/>
I noticed that ds was getting plenty of protein from milk and that he <br/>
loves fruit. And that he&#39;s much more willing to try new foods for <br/>
breakfast than for dinner...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927600274">Hi Dail,<br/>
Thanks for the kind post.  Your advice and others&#39; helped to make this<br/>
go really well today. <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;As an older mom, one thing I might suggest is you  concider  not<br/>
giving your son too much advanced info.  He wanted to go.  As it got<br/>
cloesr to time he played it over too much in his mind and it &#39;scared&#39;<br/>

the hairnet.  The fun of the factory will take over.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Other folks suggested this also. This is one thing that I have a very<br/>
difficult time balancing.  For something like a Dr visit or going to a<br/>
sitter, I don&#39;t tell him about it days in advance for that very reason,<br/>
but I also can&#39;t just spring it on him last minute either.  I have found<br/>
that the night before works best, especially if it is a morning<br/>
appointment.  He seems to do a lot better if we go through what to<br/>
expect beforehand.  In the case of the hair net, I know he would have<br/>
been resistant to having the factory people handle it.  In fact, when<br/>
she pulled out the hair nets he said he wanted to wear &quot;ours&quot;-luckily I<br/>
had brought them.  Honestly I often don&#39;t know which is harder for<br/>
him-knowing beforehand or being surprised.  He is just so painfully<br/>
sensitive. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;One example was when my oldest child was 3, she was a biter.  I read<br/>
many books on how to stop her from biting and tried many things.<br/>
including getting mean.   Then I read an article in Dr Spock ..Nothing<br/>

not say, &quot;Don&#39;t bite anyone today&quot; as you are walking out the door<br/>
because what she hears is &quot; ...Bite anyone today&quot;  I kept my mouth shut<br/>
and almost immediately  her  biting was over.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
YES!  We found this to work really well too.  Becky Bailey says that<br/>
&quot;what you focus on, you get more of.&quot;  We learned this when Scotty was 2<br/>
and started spitting.  We tried everything in our gentle parenting tool<br/>
box to get him to stop, and nothing worked.  Finally we just completely<br/>
ignored it, and he stopped within days.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone who responded.  It was a good day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-163281345">Hi aj,<br/>
<br/>
When you do this could you post it? Just this one example was so good for me to read and helpful. Thank you. Any other ones you come up with I would love to read.<br/>
<br/>
What I have noticed for me is that since I have become less domineering in my rules and more inclusive of her in the decisions she doesn&#39;t want what I was trying to limit as much, of course you all knew this to be true and surprisingly to me (not to you) she is not sitting like a lump in front of the TV all day long.  <br/>
<br/>
AND things I really feel like I have to say no to are not fought as much as they used to be....<br/>
<br/>
Ok.. so you all knew this and all but it is nice to see it happening and to feel more respected because I am being more respectful in how I talk and deal with her.<br/>

  &gt; So - I think there is a gap between what some people are saying <br/>
  about <br/>
  &gt; not having limits on tv and what others are imagining happens when <br/>
  &gt; there are no limits.<br/>
  &gt; Maybe we need to say that we substitute something else <br/>
  for &quot;limits.&quot; <br/>
  &gt; Because otherwise it sounds like we just do nothing, which is far <br/>
  from <br/>
  &gt; true. <br/>
  So what do I do instead? A bunch <br/>
  &gt; of things that are harder to talk about clearly than, &quot;Set limits.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I think this is one of the hardest parts of unschooling to grasp. I <br/>
  think I mentioned on UnschoolingDiscussion a while ago about setting <br/>
  up a two-column chart with &quot;Replace this behavior&quot; and &quot;Do this <br/>
  instead&quot;. Now I want 4 columns...I&#39;ll write it out in rows so that <br/>
  it&#39;s easier to read:<br/>
<br/>
  1) Stop controling what your kids watch and...<br/>
<br/>
  2) Start influencing (not manipulating!) what they watch and why. <br/>
  Have conversations (when they want to) about shows, the making of <br/>
  shows, the affect of sitting still vs. running around the backyard, <br/>
  etc. and you will find...<br/>
<br/>
  3) Changes in yourself: less worried and grumpy about how much tv the <br/>
  kids watch and more enjoyment of what they watch, more understanding <br/>
  of their likes and dislikes, etc. (I&#39;m blanking on good examples <br/>
  here) and you will see...<br/>
<br/>
  4) Changes in your kids: tv is something they can take or leave so <br/>
  they&#39;ll turn off a show in the middle to do something fun with you! <br/>
  And so on...<br/>
<br/>
  I could do the same for controling what kids eat. Once I loosened up, <br/>
  I noticed that ds was getting plenty of protein from milk and that he <br/>
  loves fruit. And that he&#39;s much more willing to try new foods for <br/>
  breakfast than for dinner...<br/>
<br/>
  My 2 cents in 4 columns!<br/>

 <br/>
&lt;&lt;WOW, my 6 yo<br/>
would just be ready for that now...as long as she saw<br/>
them take the hair net out of the sterilyzed package<br/>
;)  But for the noise and stuff....it might still be<br/>
too much.  He&#39;s still a little guy, and has PLENTY of<br/>
time to see factories and use toilet paper ;)  Just<br/>
because it freaks him out now doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s<br/>
super-sensitive, it just means that he&#39;s only 4....&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
and from Nance:<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve never toured a toilet paper factory and function quite well in<br/>
the <br/>
world. :)&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Just to make it clear, he had no problem whatsoever with the noise, as I<br/>
expected.  He was afraid before we went that it would be very loud, and<br/>
it was kind of loud, but no louder than the pump room at the aquarium<br/>
where his dad works, and he&#39;s been there bunches of times.  <br/>
 <br/>
Also, it was not that I felt that he HAD to see how toilet paper was<br/>
made.  It was that he kept asking me about where and how things were<br/>
made, and we drove past this particular factory every day and talked<br/>
about how they made paper in there.  He was really interested in it.<br/>
Also, he absolutely LOVES machinery.  Anything with wheels, gears, or<br/>
pulleys on it sends him into fits of joy.  Has since he was a baby.  <br/>
 <br/>
This was not the kind of thing where I woke up one morning and said<br/>
&quot;gee, what kind of educational field trip do I feel the need to impose<br/>
upon my kid because he&#39;s not in school and I need to do something?&quot;  I<br/>
sense that some of you might think that that was my motivation here.  My<br/>
problem was in helping him past his initial reluctance to where he could<br/>
go and do something I knew he would enjoy, which, thanks to some great<br/>
advice, he did.<br/>

<br/>
Do you have support group(s) in RT?  I have found that attending<br/>
things like this as an &quot;unschool trip&quot; makes everything more fun for<br/>
my guy.  Nothing&#39;s quite as scary if there&#39;s 5 or 6 of your regular<br/>
playmates attending.   <br/>
<br/>
And for things/places that offer group rates, it&#39;s an added bonus!<br/>

When you  do this could you post it? Just this one example was so good for me <br/>
to read  and helpful. Thank you. Any other ones you come up with I would love <br/>
to  read.<br/>
<br/>
What I have noticed for me is that since I have become less  domineering in <br/>
my rules and more inclusive of her in the decisions she doesn&#39;t  want what I <br/>
was trying to limit as much, of course you all knew this to be  true and <br/>
surprisingly to me (not to you) she is not sitting like a lump in  front of the TV <br/>
all day long.  <br/>
<br/>
AND things I really feel like I  have to say no to are not fought as much as <br/>
they used to be....<br/>
<br/>
Ok.. so  you all knew this and all but it is nice to see it happening and to <br/>
feel more  respected because I am being more respectful in how I talk and deal <br/>
with  her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Ta-DAAAHHH! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good for  you!<br/>
