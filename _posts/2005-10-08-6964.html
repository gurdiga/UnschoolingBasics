<div id="ygrps-yiv-988656390">Hello:) Maddie is 8 and in &quot;3rd grade&quot; she is better at unschooling <br/>
than me she often says ....&quot;I don&#39;t know what &#39;grade&#39; I am in.... <br/>
mom?&quot;&lt;g&gt; I mean that we use a variety of methods sometimes we do a unit <br/>
study(as we have Scotland and more recently Ireland)but we DO use <br/>
workbooks here and there and I guess most unschoolers don&#39;t(?)I <br/>
generally use real life applications of things that is how M learned <br/>
time and $ to read etc. I sometimes get caught up in when *I* learned a <br/>
certain thing and comparing her to others and I shouldn&#39;t. I was <br/>
worried would she learn to read cause she HATED phonics(hooked on <br/>
phonics did NOT work for us!LOL)and she didn&#39;t want to write but she&#39;d <br/>
color and draw all the time,she couldn&#39;t tie her shoes,etc Once her dad <br/>
told me to CHILL OUT and I knew I should I left her alone and rather <br/>
quickly she picked up all three! Yet I worry if I don&#39;t *make* her do <br/>
formal English lessons will she &#39;get it&#39; and be able to write reports <br/>
etc &quot;properly&quot;? She wants to use calculator NOW but I won&#39;t let her <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311435250">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Yet I worry if I don&#39;t *make* her do <br/>
formal English lessons will she &#39;get it&#39; and be able to write reports <br/>
etc &quot;properly&quot;? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does she speak English?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Reports&quot; are entirely a schoolish phenomenon. What are you having her<br/>
&quot;report&quot; on? Reports, in the school mode, are a great way to kill a love of<br/>
whatever the reports are on.<br/>
<br/>
The best tool for learning about good written expression is extensive<br/>
reading (or books-on-tape) in topics that are interesting to the learner. (I<br/>
bet Jane Austen never wrote a &quot;report&quot; in her life.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; She wants to use calculator NOW but I won&#39;t let her <br/>
until she learns simple math &#39;by hand&#39; but she&#39;s NO real interest in <br/>
that now *sigh* and if I don&#39;t push her will she &#39;get it&#39; eventually?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Get her the calculator at once - before she learns that she can&#39;t count on<br/>
you to help her in the ways she needs.<br/>
<br/>
She asked you for a simple tool and you are denying her - the opposite of<br/>
unschooling, which is facilitating their explorations to the best of our<br/>
abilities - and the limits of our budgets.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
The calculator will be a vector towards math understanding. Her path will<br/>
likely be from the calculator to her head. She may never *need* to write<br/>
simple arithmetic stuff out - again a schoolish need so that &quot;they&quot; can<br/>
evaluate the child&#39;s progress. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t push&quot; is not the same as &quot;never strew&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; What is an eclectic unschooler? I don&#39;t think I ever heard <br/>
that term before. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well probably because, at least on these Unschooling lists, the term is a<br/>
tautology at best. Unschooling by its very nature is entirely eclectic -<br/>
sparkling, wide ranging, unlimited, individual - as infinitely varied as the<br/>
wide world. <br/>
<br/>
People who are *home*schooling utilizing a variety of curriculum and<br/>
information sources and styles, such as Unit studies combined with other<br/>
school-at-home options, are often termed &quot;eclectic&quot;. It is in comparison to<br/>
people using a specific single curriculum or Charter type situations. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197631123">&lt;&lt;sometimes get caught up in when *I* learned a <br/>
certain thing and comparing her to others and I shouldn&#39;t.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, you shouldn&#39;t. :) It is awful to be compared to someone else even if it<br/>
is the memory you have of yourself as child.  Maybe when you think of doing<br/>
these things, you can take deep breaths and find something to do to amuse<br/>
yourself.  That way, you can get through the moment and not put that onto<br/>
your child.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I was <br/>
worried would she learn to read cause she HATED phonics(hooked on <br/>
phonics did NOT work for us!LOL)and she didn&#39;t want to write but she&#39;d <br/>

<br/>
How wonderful that you have a supportive dh.  Many unschoolers do not.  (I<br/>
do though, and it&#39;s great!)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Yet I worry if I don&#39;t *make* her do <br/>
formal English lessons will she &#39;get it&#39; and be able to write reports <br/>
etc &quot;properly&quot;?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She will still be exposed to writing every time she reads something.  I know<br/>
with my own children, who have always been unschooled, that they love to<br/>
write and write often and they ask for help when they need it, whether it is<br/>
for spelling, punctuation, or clarity.  Over the years I when I have been<br/>
helping them with something that they are writing, I&#39;ve mentioned things<br/>
that will help them, like when to use punctuation to make things clearer and<br/>
when to use a paragraph, etc.  My younger dd (9) loves to write stories and<br/>
is very good at it.  My older dd enjoys writing articles for our family<br/>
newspaper, email, and lists of many things.  Both understand all they need<br/>
to know to do what they want for now.  As they have the need, they will<br/>
learn more.  (And I&#39;ll be there to help them)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She wants to use calculator NOW but I won&#39;t let her <br/>
until she learns simple math &#39;by hand&#39; but she&#39;s NO real interest in <br/>
that now *sigh* and if I don&#39;t push her will she &#39;get it&#39; eventually?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I would give her the calculator and let her play with it.<br/>
That is how my older dd (probably 9 at the time) learned about square roots.<br/>
She just asked what that button was for and we talked about it.  It&#39;s a very<br/>
basic concept.  My kids have a good understanding of basic math but they<br/>
haven&#39;t done a lot of it on paper. (We play lots of games that involve<br/>
money, numbers, and logic) There is time for that and I don&#39;t worry about it<br/>
because it&#39;s way more important to know when to use a certain function than<br/>
to know have the basics memorized at a certain age.  There are all kinds of<br/>
kids in school who can do the basic math but who don&#39;t know what function to<br/>
use to solve a real life problem.  There is one girl we know who freezes up<br/>
every time anyone asks her a question because she is so nervous about<br/>
getting it wrong. It&#39;s very sad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And how? I have these &quot;worries&quot; too but I KNOW I have made the right <br/>
decision for us as a family;) getting Mom to calm down is the major <br/>
issue :)~<br/>
Tracy&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can do that faster by reading these lists and Sandradodd.com and other<br/>
unschooling resources.  It&#39;ll help you understand it better in your mind and<br/>
maybe then when you worry, you can learn to keep it to yourself.  :)  Good<br/>
luck!<br/>

Oh, can I vouch for this! My son has always played with calculators. His  <br/>
favorite thing was a piece of paper, pencil, calculator and some various dice,  <br/>
and he would spend an hour or 2 just totally absorbed in his own world. We have <br/>
 quite a few cheapy little calculators lying around the house. And at almost <br/>
6,  he can do math in his head faster than me... adding and subtracting. Even <br/>
some  simple multiplying. <br/>
 <br/>
I never understood why schools basically &quot;forbid&quot; calculators... I was even  <br/>
shamed for using my fingers. Yet, out in the REAL world, pretty much everyone  <br/>
uses a calculator.  <br/>

J: So why does she need to waste time learning things like the predicate<br/>
part of a sentence?  Punctuation, sentence structure will be picked up by<br/>
exposure.  I don&#39;t remember if you said she likes reading or not, but<br/>
throughout her life she will be exposed to grammar.  She doesn&#39;t need to be<br/>
formally taught it any more than she formally needed to be taught how eat<br/>
with a spoon.  A little guidance when she asks for it, yes, but not lessons.<br/>
And being formally taught does not guarantee that she will use proper<br/>
grammar all the time.  If her life is based in American culture, she should<br/>
speak American, not English.  Can you imagine if she was writing something<br/>
in pencil, made a mistake and asked someone for a rubber?  Or asks for help<br/>
putting her suitcases into her boot?  LOL  As far as I can tell, the only<br/>
difference between English and American is the slang and some pronunciation.<br/>
<br/>

| &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;um....this puzzles me<br/>
|<br/>
<br/>
J: Strewing is offering opportunities.  Pushing is forcing something.<br/>
Strewing is, &quot;Oh look, there is a jazz class starting up.  Is that something<br/>
you would like to do?&quot;  Pushing is, &quot;Oh look, there is a jazz class starting<br/>
up.  You should do it.  Your father always wanted to, but his parents never<br/>
had the money.  You shouldn&#39;t miss out on this chance.  Let&#39;s get you signed<br/>

At its essence writing is just speaking on paper (or computer  <br/>

speaking and writing are minor points.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While hearing kids spontaneously tell us things we didn&#39;t know they  <br/>
knew is about all unschoolers have to rely on to give us feedback  <br/>
that it&#39;s &quot;working&quot;, it will help you to get away from the idea that  <br/>
the purpose of reading is some vague &quot;comprehension&quot;. Sometimes we&#39;re  <br/>
reading (or watching) for some reason other than the author&#39;s main  <br/>
purpose for writing. For instance I read mysteries but I&#39;m really  <br/>
reading for the characters, though sometimes I couldn&#39;t tell someone  <br/>
what the main characters&#39; names are! A child may watch a movie and  <br/>
most of it passes them by except for the scenes with a cat. We might  <br/>
both &quot;fail&quot; at what we were &quot;supposed&quot; to comprehend, but we&#39;d be  <br/>
getting something more important: what *we* wanted from the story --  <br/>
and the freedom to do that! :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t worry about some &quot;right&quot; way to do math. Let her use the  <br/>
calculator any time she wants. If she sees the answer, she&#39;s going to  <br/>
absorb something about how numbers work.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are forced to go through the motions to add 345+678 without  <br/>
really understanding how numbers work or what they&#39;re really doing.  <br/>
It&#39;s way more important that she get to mess around with numbers, use  <br/>
a calculator, hear you do math out loud as your trying to figure out  <br/>
an answer, have allowance to spend, than to do pencil and paper math.  <br/>
Pencil and paper math is very abstract and isn&#39;t a good way to  <br/>
understand the working of numbers.<br/>

You don&#39;t *allow* her to play with a calculator? That&#39;s how Duncan figured out <br/>
square roots and percentages and how to figgure his algorithms for adding such <br/>
large numbers---that&#39;s EXACTLY how he learned that math! By playing with a calculator!<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re requiring her to learn how to do boring methodical addition INSTEAD of learning<br/>
to PLAY with numbers????<br/>
 <br/>
Let her play. She&#39;ll figure it out THROUGH play! Seriously!<br/>

This seems like an indication of schoolish thinking (and jargon!) still<br/>
permeating your mind. The assumptions behind this sentence could include<br/>
that you are in charge of her learning, that you have the important job of<br/>
testing her comprehension, that her reading is for the purpose of learning<br/>
how to read better or has some other overtly educational purpose. <br/>
<br/>
Further schoolish ideas include that it is ok to engage in inauthentic<br/>
speech with children (by which I mean that you have a hidden agenda to<br/>
test/quiz her) and that your educational agenda should be paramount, rather<br/>
than freeing her to take charge of her own learning journey. Lurking even<br/>
more deeply might be the ideas that quizzing has some kind of intrinsic<br/>
value (I believe not) and that her academic achievements are important<br/>
validations of your parenting.<br/>
<br/>
It can be tough to let go of the desire to keep track of a child&#39;s<br/>
&quot;progress&quot; or to want to categorize their activities into schoolish terms. <br/>
<br/>
If you are living in a reporting/assessing State, the temptation to keep<br/>
living in this mindset is even stronger. In that situation I have two<br/>
recommendations. The first is to keep the records and your record-keeping<br/>
actions as private as possible, rather than burden your children with the<br/>
State&#39;s expectations. The second is to keep your records in terms of what<br/>
your children have *done* if you can, (still using &quot;educationese&quot;) and leave<br/>
the educational authorities to make their own assumptions about what the<br/>
children have *learnt*. <br/>
<br/>
What about a genuine conversation with her about what she enjoyed about the<br/>
book?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; She *has* one I just haven&#39;t let her do 345+678= type math <br/>
problems w/it yet. She doesn&#39;t know how to do these on her own,she <br/>
does play w/it and use it in her &#39;store&#39; etc &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have to say I&#39;m kinda floored by the concept of you not &quot;letting&quot; her use<br/>
her own calculator for its primary purpose of calculating. I think you are<br/>
still dividing life into &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;entertaining&quot; (or perhaps<br/>
&quot;trivial play&quot; would be more accurate). I&#39;m going to ask you to think about<br/>
why you believe you have the right to tell her what to do with her own tool<br/>
or to control her learning, and what you hope to achieve by living in that<br/>
mode.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly wider society and the dominant school based culture in this<br/>
country give parents both the legal right and the cultural sanction (to<br/>
varying points) to be authoritarian or controlling with their children.<br/>
However Unschoolers at every moment are making the amazing choice to<br/>
voluntarily renounce these entitlements in favor of creating an environment<br/>
and culture of freedom and autonomy for their children.<br/>
<br/>
Part of that wonderful choice includes a much greater respect for privacy,<br/>
especially privacy of thought, on the part of the children.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that it is damaging to the relationship for a child to believe<br/>
that her parent is an arbiter or assessor of her learning or her worth. I<br/>
believe it is damaging to the relationship for a child to be placed in a<br/>
position of being suspicious about a parent&#39;s motives when they initiate a<br/>
conversation. I believe that it is damaging to the relationship for the<br/>
children to feel that they need permission to engage in any passion or hobby<br/>
(beyond the cooperative sharing of resources). I believe it is damaging to<br/>
the soul for it to be implied that one&#39;s play is less worthy than<br/>
traditional academic pursuits. <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers who have let go of the schoolish in their thinking and their<br/>
words, are on the path to much deeper, wonderful, honest relationships with<br/>
their children, where the concept of &quot;permission&quot; is utterly replaced with<br/>
ideas like &quot;co-operation&quot;, &quot;facilitating&quot;, &quot;pleasant surprises of unexpected<br/>
kindness&quot; and most of all &quot;transcendent moments of magical timing&quot;. <br/>
