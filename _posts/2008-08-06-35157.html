As a speech-language pathologist and unschooling parent,  I&#39;m  very cautious <br/>
about recommending speech-language therapy especially for young  children.  <br/>
Most often, articulation errors and expressive/reception  language problems are <br/>
developmental and will just take care of themselves.   All those s and r <br/>
sounds magically disappear with and without therapy.  I  usually recommend a &quot;watch <br/>
and wait&quot; approach and encourage parents to be sure  that they provide a <br/>
language rich environment and see what improvements come  about in a year or so.  <br/>
As many other posters have commented, most  children speak quite fluently in  <br/>
and clearly in their own  time without intervention.<br/>
 <br/>
If a child has become extremely self-conscious about their  speech (usually <br/>
an older child),  I will first work with the parent  and child together and <br/>
offer suggestions of specific things they can do at  home.  There are some fun <br/>
games that help target certain sounds and they  are easily available for parents <br/>
to buy.<br/>
 <br/>
There are times, however, that I do recommend therapy.  Verbal apraxia  can <br/>
be very different from the typical speech problems most people are used to  <br/>
seeing. It is difficult to know the severity of this child&#39;s verbal apraxia  from <br/>
a post.  It can be very similar to the kind of therapy needed after a  <br/>
stroke.  Few people would recommend against speech therapy for an  adult that had <br/>
difficulty speaking or understanding after a stroke or some other  brain injury. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
This might be a situation where the parent could find a more supportive  <br/>
speech pathologist who would work with them rather than dictating what they  <br/>
should be doing.  Verbal apraxia can significantly impact the ability  to <br/>
communicate and may need some direct therapy.   The answer to  your question about <br/>
whether therapy is needed is &quot;It depends&quot; just as it is for  many other situations.<br/>
 <br/>
I would definitely recommend finding someone who is supportive of your  <br/>
parenting philosophy if you decide to pursue further therapy.  I&#39;d be happy  to <br/>
discuss this more off-list if you have other questions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463663349">Absolutely! I have the same thing and there are still sometimes I have<br/>
problems or I make up words usually the blending of two similar meaning<br/>
words to fit my meaning but not done intentionally. My son has taken to<br/>
enunciating words for me when I miss something which I need to not let me<br/>
upset me because he is only doing what I have done for him and he is only<br/>
trying to help. It is not just the motor it is the conduit from the brain to<br/>
the mouth. Imagine a subway with too many people so full that the people<br/>
cannot move. Practice helped me a lot but I was only receptive when I found<br/>
something I wanted. Doctor Seuss books read aloud helped a lot and we still<br/>
do - now my son is taking joy in taking turns doing it and no one can do an<br/>
entire book at an insane pace perfectly. Getting the word in the eye to the<br/>
brain, process, translate and to the mouth is a lot of work so find things<br/>
that make it fun or at least make it a mommy/daddy and me thing.<br/>
