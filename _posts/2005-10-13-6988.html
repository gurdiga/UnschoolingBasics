<div id="ygrps-yiv-801341922">25% off on *any* book not just for &quot;educational&quot; purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Simultaneously they&#39;re having a buy 3 get the 4th free and buy 2 get  <br/>
the 3rd free on certain genres and titles and you get 25% off those too.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they&#39;ve asked me for proof, sometimes not. (For MA I&#39;ve  <br/>
just shown them my approval letter from the superintendent.)<br/>
