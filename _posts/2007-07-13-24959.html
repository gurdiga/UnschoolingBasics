&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you for your thoughts and example Danielle. I&#39;m wondering your<br/>
&gt; thoughts on how to create a win/win for a younger age group. If I<br/>
&gt; had the ability to talk things through with each child it would make<br/>
&gt; it a lot easier. My daughter is 4 and I can talk things through with<br/>
&gt; her. My son however is 15 months.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, what I would say is that you&#39;re laying the ground work. Every time <br/>
you engage in the process, regardless of the outcome, you are helping <br/>
them learn problem solving skills. Each time you engage in the process, <br/>
you&#39;re helping them to hear and consider others&#39; needs and you&#39;re <br/>
sending the message that their needs are important enough to be heard <br/>
and considered and met as well. Each time you engage in the process with <br/>
a successful win/ win outcome, your kids learn to trust in the process <br/>
and that their needs will be met.<br/>
<br/>
As with most things, I&#39;d say that it&#39;s process and not product that <br/>
matters--something I was trying to convey in my first post. It&#39;s hard, <br/>
though, when you&#39;re first starting out and setting a goal, not to be <br/>
product oriented. And certainly, I remember well being at that stage <br/>
with very young children and not seeing how it could be possible in <br/>
practice to find common preference with young people who seemed to have <br/>
such an entirely different rationalizing perspective than I had. Not <br/>
that they weren&#39;t rational beings--they were! Their reason was just <br/>
often quite different from my own.<br/>
<br/>
I went and dug this out for you over at the TCS (Taking Children <br/>
Seriously) website. It&#39;s a post of mine from back in 2004 when my kids <br/>
were younger than they are now, and I was without the benefit of <br/>
hindsight and experience that I now enjoy:<br/>

      ***Multiple children<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading as much about TCS as I can and trying diligently to <br/>
implement it in my own family.<br/>
<br/>
But...<br/>
<br/>
So many of the scenarios and solutions presented within TCS seem to <br/>
depend on only * one child *. Negotiating common preferences and having <br/>
everyone follow through with the common preference seems to become <br/>
exponentially more difficult with each additional child. TCS parenting <br/>
of * multiple very young children * often seems like an ideal rather <br/>
than a practical reality.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to hear about how other TCS parents would negotiate common <br/>
preferences with multiple children, particularly those under the age of <br/>
six.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose, for instance, that a family with several young children manage <br/>
to find a common preference only to have one member change his mind <br/>
midway through the solution. Does this, then, throw us all back into the <br/>
negotiation stage?<br/>
<br/>
How does it not undermine the whole process when there is no guarantee <br/>
of follow-through?<br/>
<br/>
At what point can the parent gently remind the child that he had agreed <br/>
to spending a certain amount of time doing something for another child <br/>
in order to ensure that those other children would do something for him <br/>
immediately after, especially when participation in an organized group <br/>
event makes the order/ timing non-negotiable?<br/>
<br/>
And what if that gentle reminder does not make a difference? Does <br/>
everyone pack up and go home without having fulfilled anyone&#39;s <br/>
preference, which seems so punitive to all members?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, TCS parenting seems so unattainable when one cannot double or <br/>
triple oneself (or hire someone to serve that function) and fulfill <br/>
everyone&#39;s needs at the same time.**********<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have a toy golf set (plastic) complete with clubs and balls and a<br/>
&gt; little caddy. My son loves the golf set. He likes to pretend to play<br/>
&gt; golf by swinging the club to hit the ball.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have several thoughts, but of course it&#39;s always easier to solve <br/>
someone else&#39;s problems than one&#39;s own. *g*<br/>
<br/>
My first suggestion in moving towards win/ win problem solving would be <br/>
to take a back seat in the fixing department. As parents, we so often <br/>
want to jump in and *fix* our kids problems--it seems like our job and <br/>
it feels better when everyone&#39;s happy. But, with problem-solving, there <br/>
are a lot of important steps in between the problem and the fix, and <br/>
it&#39;s important not to leave kids out of those steps. Interestingly, I&#39;ve <br/>
found *facilitating* problem-solving to be far more empowering for the <br/>
kids than swooping in and fixing things from the standpoint of parental <br/>
authority and power.<br/>
<br/>
So, what I&#39;m reading in your example--and all I have to go on is what <br/>
you&#39;ve written--is that you&#39;ve come up with solutions in the moment and <br/>
are having trouble implementing those solutions in a way that everyone&#39;s <br/>
happy. This is where I&#39;d suggest that instead of coming up with <br/>
solutions, you try observing what you see, really neutrally, and asking <br/>
if they have any ideas: &quot;Ooh, you&#39;re having so much fun Damien, but I <br/>
see *Jenny (don&#39;t know you&#39;re dd&#39;s name) is afraid she might be hit. Can <br/>
we find a way for Damien to play golf and for Jenny to feel safe at the <br/>
same time?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I mean when I talk about the process--setting up the problem <br/>
and asking for a solution that meets everyone&#39;s needs. My job as a <br/>
parent--as a mediator and facilitator--is often to try to articulate <br/>
each person&#39;s point of view in a way that everyone can understand, <br/>
adding &quot;translating&quot; to my job list. That draws on my own skills of <br/>
mindful and compassionate observation, and I&#39;ve had to cultivate over <br/>
the years my ability to see and understand multiple perspectives at the <br/>
same time without overlaying my own judgment and personal baggage--a <br/>
tremendous personal growing experience that certainly doesn&#39;t happen <br/>
overnight. It takes work!<br/>
<br/>
My journey and my sources have been long and varied, and I&#39;ve cobbled <br/>
together tools from many different sources. The observation thing came <br/>
from Faber and Mazlish. Lots of the problem solving stuff came from my <br/>
reading in TCS. Some of the mediating techniques I&#39;ve drawn from my <br/>
reading in Buddhism, and others I&#39;ve taken from NVC (Non-Violent <br/>
Communication). As much as any of those, if not more so, reading and <br/>
posting on the unschooling lists and hanging &quot;virtually&quot; with other <br/>
mindful, unschooling parents helps me remain open, respectful, <br/>
compassionate, and mindful.<br/>
