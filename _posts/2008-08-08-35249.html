<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459501235">unschoolingbasicsLOL -- it&#39;s a joke. The Jets stink! DH knows that. He&#39;s not hurt when he&#39;s kidded about it.<br/>
<br/>
The whole world does not have to be kinder and gentler every single minute. Some things are what they are and don&#39;t need to be sugarcoated.<br/>
<br/>
And please read the rest of what I wrote about understanding the difference between a game or a show and a person. <br/>

Earlier in this topic you said &quot;he is a Jets fan after all. He&#39;s used<br/>
to disdain.&quot; and I just cringed. I realize you weren&#39;t talking to me<br/>
directly -- I overheard you much as I might at a gathering. My first<br/>
thought, tho, was &quot;are all sports fans that mean-spirited towards each<br/>
other?&quot; My next thought was to wonder why you would joke about your<br/>
husband being used to disdain. My response is not because I&#39;m<br/>
fragile, but because I really think a kinder world is a good thing,<br/>
and every little kindness helps.<br/>

<br/>
Now that&#39;s exactly the kind of joking we do at our house. I think it&#39;s<br/>
a personality thing....and maybe a family culture thing. It&#39;s part of<br/>
our family culture to utilize sarcasm regularly. Not in a mean way.<br/>
But if you&#39;re a sports fan you probably have a pretty thick skin. <br/>
