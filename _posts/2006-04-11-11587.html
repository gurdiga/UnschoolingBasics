What outside activites (weekly stuff) do your kids particpate in?<br/>

&quot;Outside&quot; of what? (wink)<br/>
MOndays we do whatever,<br/>
Tuesdays we go on a day trip. Next Tuesday we are going to DC to the IMAX <br/>
theater to see a James Cameron underwater film.<br/>
Wednesdays Emily (12) has chemistry and art journaling and a voice lesson<br/>
Thursdays are Riding days but we are planning on changing barns so that is <br/>
temporarily suspended.<br/>
Fridays Zack (18) has Music class, Spirit Quest (philosophical discussion <br/>
like) and social awareness, Emily is making a movie with a group there, <br/>
she&#39;s the bad guy.<br/>
Max plays. There is a lego group that meets once a week that we may start <br/>
going to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It varies seasonally a lot as well as how we&#39;re all feeling, what <br/>
we&#39;re needing.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, DS goes to a friend&#39;s house to play on Friday afternoons <br/>
(DH plays Scrabble with the mom while the kids play) - that runs <br/>
Labor Day to sometime in June, once summer hits, there&#39;s too much <br/>
other stuff usually, though they do get together when possible.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple hs groups with park days during the summer and <br/>
they go to one or more of those, depending.<br/>
<br/>
A hs group we belong to has co-op activities (Sept-Nov, and again <br/>
Mar-May, 8 week sessions) and sometimes DS is interested in <br/>
something offered (one was a cooking/science class - stuff like why <br/>
does bread rise and why does popcorn pop). Other times it&#39;s <br/>
too &quot;schoolish&quot; in focus and DS doesn&#39;t pick anything.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday is church and Bible class.<br/>
<br/>
He did a local soccer camp (one week, every morning) for a couple <br/>
years but chose not to last year.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking at visiting a local art studio place to see if he&#39;d be <br/>
interested in painting or clay - it&#39;s a very free form kind of <br/>
place. Instead of signing up for &quot;drawing lessons&quot;, you buy a pass <br/>
for 6 class sessions or whatever (can be more but I think 6 is <br/>
minimum). Then you pick a time when you usually go. During that <br/>
time, there will be some people drawing, some painting, some <br/>
sculpting/creating in clay. Each person is guided/assisted as needed <br/>
to reach their own personal goals - it&#39;s not a &quot;let&#39;s all draw this <br/>
fruit bowl. This is how to make a pear...&quot; type situation (unless <br/>
you specifically choose to take a specialized class time in life <br/>
drawing or something such as that which they also offer).<br/>
<br/>
Mostly things are free form as stuff arises.<br/>
