<div id="ygrps-yiv-154391605">As I don&#39;t have a car yet, we just mostly hang in the house. My<br/>
husband is mostly too busy to take us out. I got lots of colorful<br/>
papers to make crafts with them. But what? my son isn&#39;t interested at<br/>
them at all. at first he claimed he wants to make a butterfly but he<br/>
lost interest. He plays in the computer and watches movies of spiderman.<br/>
<br/>
I make breakfast he comes to eat it then runs back to the computer. <br/>
I got a nice book so I read it. My son comes sits next to me asking me<br/>
to read it to him.<br/>
<br/>
Then the boy from the friends who are also homeschooled is coming to<br/>
my house. His younger brother who is my son&#39;s age is going to school.<br/>
(he asked his mother to go to school)<br/>
Both of the boys run upstairs to the computer again.<br/>
<br/>
I went downstairs to do housework. Then dinnertime came already. My<br/>
son finished to eat then he walks around singing to himself. or he is<br/>
riding the trycycle. <br/>
<br/>
some days I take him out to the park with the younger siblings.<br/>
(sister and brother)<br/>
<br/>
Well, i can&#39;t help it but be self conscious when the people are asking<br/>
me: what are you doing all day?!! It certainly look like I do<br/>
&#39;nothing&#39; with my son.<br/>
<br/>
Is it okay? (Here I go, deschooling myself too!)</div>
