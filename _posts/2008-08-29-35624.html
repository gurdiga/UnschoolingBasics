<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183185743">Hi we have been a homeschooling/unschooling family for 12 years now. <br/>
As my daughter is turning 12 and I believe that learning begins at <br/>
birth, and we all really are our kids first teachers. I had decided <br/>
when my daughter was 2 to homeschool. At this time I knew very little <br/>
about it and had never even heard the term unschooling. It wasn&#39;t <br/>
until she was 5 and my family (and every one else that should not <br/>
have mattered)became concerned she wasn&#39;t in school that I began to <br/>
try to have some kind of school house in my house. After days and <br/>
weeks of fighting and tears at trying to make her &quot;sit and do her <br/>
work&quot; I knew this wasn&#39;t for me. She had learned so much more before <br/>
I started to try to please, and to prove to everyone else in our <br/>
lives that she didn&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to be enrolled in public school. Around <br/>
this time I found my first article on &quot;unschooling&quot;. I read articles <br/>
and stories for 3 days straight. I thought gosh this is what I was <br/>
doing BEFORE I officially started &quot;homeschooling&quot;. So we settled into <br/>
a comfortable schooling routine that wasn&#39;t nearly as strict. The <br/>
only thing is the pressures from the family, and people we never met <br/>
never went away. My children are quized on a regular basis to see how <br/>
much they &quot;know&quot;. I managed well with these things until I became ill <br/>
4 years ago. We were away from home more during the &quot;school hours&quot; <br/>
and some places we were going to a lot, like doctors offices <br/>
were &quot;concerned&quot; why my kids weren&#39;t in school. I would explain that <br/>
they were homeschooled but this just made them more intense on how I <br/>
was schooling them being so sick. Well this escalated into a really <br/>
bad situation (I won&#39;t go into details) that drove me to fight my <br/>
kids once again to try and please other people. I had struggled for <br/>
about 2 years before giving in and trying it other peoples way. In <br/>
that time my children learned a lot of compassion for sick people. <br/>
They learned a lot about medications and side effects. about <br/>
illnesses and names of illnesses. They learned how to care for a <br/>
person that is sick, and they learned what to do in a medical <br/>
emergency. They were able to relay to paramedics my allergies, and <br/>
any medications I was on. I had to stop that when my daughters doctor <br/>
told me she didn&#39;t want her to know what kind of medication I am on <br/>
it makes her feel responsible for me. (I&#39;m sorry am I only supposed <br/>
say the name of my medication after I lock her in her room (no I <br/>
don&#39;t do that)? She is smart and picks up on things) So back to <br/>
forcing this time 2 children to sit and try to learn. Well I have <br/>
done it for 2 years now, and it is not making any of us happy. So I <br/>
have found some unschooling groups on here, and have been getting <br/>
reinspired. I thank you all for sharing your ideas and inspiration <br/>
with each other as I am remembering the joys I had before I was <br/>
pushed back into a different lifestyle again. I hope to find friends <br/>
and share inspiration with all of you. If anyone has any ideas on how <br/>
to handle these situations with people threatening me and even some <br/>
taking action because my children are not hid from the world during <br/>
school hours I would really appreciate the advice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
and happy f-unschooling to all of you.</div>
