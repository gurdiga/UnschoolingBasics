<div id="ygrps-yiv-665432777">CDs and the MP3 are now available on the website. www.liveandlearnconference.org  Click on Resources. They forgot to send Pam&#39;s Einstein CD, but it will be here shortly.<br/>
 <br/>
CDs are mostly $10 each. They combined my talk with Ben&#39;s, so you can get two for $15. They also combined two of Anne&#39;s talks---same deal. Pam & Roya&#39;s together was almost two hours---it&#39;s a two CD set for $15.<br/>
 <br/>
Bumper stickers are $2 each. T-shirts are $10 for youth and $12 for adult sizes---the available sizes are listed. We also have a few tapes from years one and two at a greatly reduced price! Snatch &#39;em up!<br/>
 <br/>
You can order online and pay via PayPal or snail mail the form and pay by check---or any combination! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
