<div id="ygrps-yiv-615574631">I had a big &quot;screwup&quot; moment this afternoon with my 5yo son, and I&#39;m asking<br/>
for some feedback and ideas to help me improve my response the next time a<br/>
similar situation arises.  I&#39;m ready for everyone to be honest and &#39;beat me<br/>
over the head&#39; with unschooling wisdom, lol!<br/>
 <br/>
My two boys (9 and 5) were playing a wrestling-type game in my room this<br/>
afternoon.  This is the one room in the house that I really prefer to keep<br/>
somewhat tidy - it&#39;s my refuge when *I* get overwhelmed and need a quiet<br/>
moment to regroup.  They had taken all the dirty clothes and thrown them<br/>
around (they were rolling in them, hiding under them, etc.) and then had a<br/>
folding chair in there too.  I told them that it made me uncomfortable to<br/>
have my &#39;refuge room&#39; looking so chaotic, and if they would please put the<br/>
dirty clothes back in the hamper and take out the chair when their wrestling<br/>
was finished.<br/>
 <br/>
Later in the day I went in the room and it was still a chaotic jumble.  I<br/>
went to the boys and (not as nicely as I could have, eep), said that they&#39;d<br/>
left the mess that they had agreed to pick up for me.  My 9yo went in to<br/>
clean it, but the 5yo was suddenly &quot;too tired&quot; (his code word for being<br/>
overwhelmed by the job).  This is where I *really* screwed up - I *demanded*<br/>
that he help his brother clean it up, and when he went into my room and<br/>
climbed into my bed to &quot;nap&quot;, I got angry and sent him to his room.  <br/>
 <br/>
*sigh*  Not handled so well, huh?  I know that I could have just put the<br/>
dirty clothes away myself in less than 10 seconds and that would be that.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t about the mess, now that I think about it.  It was that *my*<br/>
feelings were hurt that after explaining to them how important it was to me<br/>
that my room be tidy for *me*, the 5yo didn&#39;t honor that.  And yeah...he&#39;s<br/>
5.  Probably a bit much for me to expect of him, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
 <br/>
So....lay it on.  I *kinda* know what went wrong here, but I&#39;m still pretty<br/>
stuck on feeling that I need to &quot;teach&quot; the 5yo to be more respectful of<br/>
other people&#39;s spaces (he does this in his brother&#39;s room as well - makes a<br/>
*major* mess and refuses to help put it to rights).  Please help me<br/>
rethink/reframe this - I know it is *my* problem!<br/>

I think you went wrong when you asked them to put things back after they <br/>
were done wrestling and then left the room. Really, it was pretty predictable <br/>
at that point, that you&#39;d come back later to find things as they were when <br/>
you left, or worse. In the excitement of wrestling, they won&#39;t remember. When <br/>
they quit because they&#39;re tired, they won&#39;t remember. <br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I would have asked them not to wrestle in my room, to move <br/>
to another spot. I would have offered to set it up for them. I would have <br/>
said &quot;No, it is not okay for you to wrestle in my room.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty unrealistic to expect that you can keep a spot as a refuge by <br/>
having folks clean up after they&#39;re done messing it. Far easier to keep it <br/>
unmessed in the first place, by moving these activities to the designated <br/>
messy areas of the house. <br/>
<br/>
It really is okay to say &quot;This one place I need to keep for me.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you appologised? You can still do it. Let him know that you screwed up, that you know it, that you&#39;re sorry. The good thing about screwing up is that you have the opportunity to turn things around, to mend the relationship, And to model taking responsibility for your mistakes. Hooray (ouch)!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Definitely too much to expect. Its okay to talk about your feelings being hurt *if* you can do it in a way that&#39;s not going to load your guy down with guilt or an expectation that he&#39;s responsible for your feelings. If not, don&#39;t bring it up. Its good that You know what it was that made you react the way you did. Maybe next time you&#39;ll remember sooner and have a better response ready.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its not the sort of thing that can be taught - what you&#39;re talking about isn&#39;t even one idea, its a whole mass of concepts rolled together. Think about what&#39;s involved in &quot;being respectful of others&#39; spaces&quot; - there&#39;s awareness of the environment, ownership, personal boundaries, personal standards, Plus impulse control, thoughfulness, and the ability to budget ones&#39; energy. Whew! That&#39;s more than some adults can handle every single day, let alone a five year old!<br/>
<br/>
People are genuinely respectful when they have a reason to be - when they find another person worthy of esteem. Offering kids respect on a regular basis helps them have the ability to respect others. But even when your 5yo is full to the brim with love and respect, he won&#39;t always have ability to do anything about it - he&#39;ll be overwhelmed or tired or just not have enough impulse control. So you can show him even more respect and generosity by helping him out in those moments. <br/>
