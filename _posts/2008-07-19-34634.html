<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303786741">Housefairy must have a different web address since the one Shannon gave is<br/>
an empty domain.<br/>
<br/>
Flylady.net is most definitely *not* unschooly.  However I do like some of<br/>
her principles and I think she&#39;s very helpful for different approaches to<br/>
cleaning attitudes, and quite a few great techniques too by the way.  House<br/>
Fairy is on Flylady further down on the home page.  One hesitation I have<br/>
with using these programs (from an unschooling standpoint) is rewards are<br/>
done in a topdown fashion.  BUT a parent *could* choose to present the ideas<br/>
and allow the child/ren to manage and use any rewards for themselves as they<br/>
see fit.  It could be tweaked for unschooling.  I don&#39;t like the idea of<br/>
saying it like: &quot;reward yourself&quot; any better than someone else rewarding<br/>
another person... it&#39;s still positive reinforcement.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t like the idea that people are somehow better or happier when<br/>
their things are clean.  Just me personally--- I like things to be clean but<br/>
I don&#39;t have that enjoyment attached to *me* and how I see myself or how I<br/>
feel about myself.  To my mind, enjoyment of a clean environment and being<br/>
happy with who I am are separate.<br/>
<br/>
I do like Flylady however, in my own fashion.  I may not interpret cleaning<br/>
the same way she does, but I do *love* many of her ideas.  One of my<br/>
buggaboos is forgetfulness and I have found her techniques to actually be<br/>
useful for me.  Most ideas about dealing with time and not forgetting what<br/>
needs to be done don&#39;t work for me.  Hey and the roomy calendar she sells<br/>
totally rocks!  Thanks for the reminder to order the thing.  I forgot...<br/>
haha.<br/>

&gt;   I don&#39;t know how unschooling House Fairy (Housefairy.com ) would be<br/>
&gt; considered but she works in our house.. She helps you by giving you the<br/>
&gt; tools to give your children the tools to pickup after themselves. It has<br/>
&gt; helped the adults as well as the kids. I have to say that I just didn&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; my kids as being capable of doing what I thought they needed to do but we<br/>
&gt; have all learned differently. My eight year old even helps with the<br/>
&gt; laundry.<br/>
&gt; That is not to say that he has done it by himself. Housework can be fun and<br/>
&gt; even it takes longer it is much more fun done together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217455433">I visit FlyLady when i&#39;m feeling particularly overwhelmed.  Her ideas<br/>
help me put the house work into perspective.  I love her idea to spend<br/>
15 minutes on something.  15 minutes is not overwhelming even when the<br/>
laundry pile or the kids rooms or the whole house is!  <br/>
<br/>
I also use her cleaning lists sometimes.  I tend to be a bit<br/>
scatterbrained so following a list really helps me tidy up when I&#39;m<br/>
feeling the need for more &quot;tidiness&quot;.  <br/>
