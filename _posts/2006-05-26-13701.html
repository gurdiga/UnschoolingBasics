<div id="ygrps-yiv-656455831">My son often wants popsicles instead of a meal. This is fine with me  because <br/>
we always make them together. We use Kefir and frozen bananas as a base,  <br/>
then add whatever fruits he wants. I generally add some healthy stuff in then we  <br/>
whiz them up together and freeze them.  They are sweet enough from the  <br/>
fruit, and full of vitamins and bene bacs from the kefir. I don&#39;t mind if he  <br/>
substitutes them for a meal. He has fun making different flavors and then has  fun <br/>
eating &quot;ice cream&quot; for breakfast or whenever.<br/>
