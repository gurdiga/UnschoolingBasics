<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785127416">Is there any mailinglist or weblog that you know of with practical  <br/>
advice about unschooling / gentle parenting / non coercive methods  <br/>
with toddlers?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling my 7yr old daughter is getting easier every day – I&#39;m  <br/>
wondering how it will be with my 1yr old son, and I want to have a  <br/>
place where to seek advice. It&#39;s about limitations concerning exactly  <br/>
what Ren said – like throwing stones on other people&#39;s cars,  running  <br/>
into gardens of other people, touching everything in a store (boosk,  <br/>
fruits) and such. Except for the stones which can also be dangerous  <br/>
for people (and when danger is involved I feel free to step in), I  <br/>
wonder how I would react and help my child not to do these things but  <br/>
still be gentle. Pat – Is that what your list is about?<br/>
<br/>
I know what you&#39;re gonna say – I have to find my way, you&#39;re not  <br/>
there to tell me how to do these things :-) I would like to know how  <br/>
you handle these things or – that&#39;s actually my original question –  <br/>
if you know of a mailinglist or weblog about exactly toddlers whith  <br/>
whom you cannot &#39;reason&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>
<br/>
Johanna :-)</div>

<br/>
 From the group description:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At AlwaysUnschooled, members create a space in which Radical  <br/>
Unschooling can be seriously discussed as a lifestyle that begins at  <br/>
birth. AU is geared towards thoughtful discussion and exploration of  <br/>
what Radical Unschooling looks like from birth and beyond for our  <br/>
&quot;always unschooled&quot; children.<br/>
<br/>
Secular in nature, we welcome unschoolers from all walks of life. Our  <br/>
discussions focus on exploring topics like natural learning,  <br/>
respectful parenting, joyful living, freedom and autonomy, living by  <br/>
principles, single parent unschooling, convincing family, surviving  <br/>
panic and criticism, living without fear, resisting enrollment, non- <br/>
coercive parenting, deschooling ourselves, and letting go of controls.:<br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;ll get a lot of practical advice right here, but you might<br/>
also like the Always Unschooled email list. Are you on that one?  It&#39;s<br/>
focused on kids under the age of 8.<br/>
<br/>
There are a ton of blogs listed in the &quot;links&quot; section of this site,<br/>
many of them posting about toddlers but not necessarily what you&#39;re<br/>
looking for. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154221096">Johanna, yes, the Consensual Living list moves beyond non-coercive<br/>
parenting toward creating mutually agreeable solutions in all<br/>
relationships. There is an article &quot;Creating the Climate for<br/>
Consensual Living&quot; in the files section there which is very helpful,<br/>
imo. We often discuss honoring toddler&#39;s impulses in practical ways<br/>
that are not negatively impacting others. The Always Unschooled list<br/>
is for radically unschooling families of always unschooled children,<br/>
inclusive of very young children. Danielle the list owner of AU is<br/>
very committed to non-coercive parenting. We also discuss consensual<br/>
living (creating win-win) there. Issues related to schooling,<br/>
partners, and non-parental relationships with others are able to be<br/>
discussed on the CL list with the goal of seeking agreements that are<br/>
satisfying to everyone. <br/>

many e-mails, and I can&#39;t seem to filter ;-)<br/>

kiddos. ;) <br/>
<br/>
Our focus is now &quot;from birth and beyond&quot; for those interested, as a <br/>
growing handful of AU mamas now have kiddos over the age of 8 or will <br/>
very soon.<br/>
