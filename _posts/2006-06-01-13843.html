play video games---unless it&#39;s brand new! Then he chooses to play with <br/>
it for some time. Neither has ever eaten a box of cookies for dinner. <br/>

&gt; their teeth on my schedule.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 18 yo DID play videogames for more than 12 hours per day, for the  <br/>
past two days (Tuesday and Wednesday) she probably played &quot;The SIMS&quot;  <br/>
about 16 hours each day. She&#39;s on a break - she just finished doing a  <br/>
very intense musical theater production at the community college, in  <br/>
which she had her first really big lead part - it was exhausting. She  <br/>
also was just in her first big dance concert - she took up dancing  <br/>
late - at 16 years old - and it is hard for her. She has her first- <br/>
ever boyfriend - so there is a lot of stress (good stress/happy  <br/>
stress) associated with that, for her - lots of self-consciousness,  <br/>
especially.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah - and there is the fact that we had a fire in our house,  <br/>
we&#39;re living in a rental without almost any of our own belongings -  <br/>
the rest of us got clothing out, but she got almost none of her  <br/>
clothing - none of her music, and on and on. (It isn&#39;t burned up, it  <br/>
is mostly being cleaned and stored - but it has been 3 months and she  <br/>
really misses her stuff more than the rest of us do.)<br/>
<br/>
Taking two full days to do NOTHING but play &quot;The SIMS&quot; seems like a  <br/>
really nice kind of down time to me. So - she did that for two days  <br/>
and then yesterday evening she came to our homeschool park day with  <br/>
my husband, just to hang around with other people for an hour or two,  <br/>
and then later last night about 11 pm she suddenly called a  <br/>
girlfriend and made arrangements to go there and spend the night and  <br/>
some other kids are going too and she seemed all refreshed and happy  <br/>
and ready to party! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Other times that my kids have played videogames for hour after hour -  <br/>
day after day - have not always been so obviously &quot;recovery time.&quot;  <br/>
Sometimes it is because they have a new game and they LOVE it and are  <br/>
challenged to master it and just don&#39;t want to stop until they have  <br/>
had enough.<br/>
<br/>
I know lots of kids who play videogames at night - most of the night.  <br/>
These are games in which they interact with other players, online,  <br/>
and they go on all night, partly because of time zone differences. It  <br/>
is exciting, fun, there is a LOT of learning going on.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie just completed an online driver education course - worked on it  <br/>
about 6 hours per day, for about 6 days. A few months ago she was  <br/>
doing an online math course (ALEKS) the same way - spending 6 to 8  <br/>
hours per day on it. That&#39;s how some people function - it is how &quot;I&quot;  <br/>
function, too.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see any difference between playing videogames and doing the  <br/>
math or drivers ed online programs, in terms of &quot;educational value.&quot;  <br/>
Some people would be impressed and think it was wonderful that she  <br/>
worked so hard on the online &quot;courses&quot; and would be distressed by  <br/>
spending that same amount of time playing online games. To separate  <br/>
what is educational from what is not - that seems incredibly arrogant  <br/>
to me. I know, from years of watching many many kids, that we cannot  <br/>
see, from the outside, what is happening inside their heads - we  <br/>
can&#39;t know what brain development is taking place, we can&#39;t know what  <br/>
they are really learning, and it is ridiculous for us to think we  <br/>
know better than they do which activity is more valuable for them.<br/>

<br/>
can we all just take a moment to remember those people who have changed the<br/>
world because they pursued their passions (like hello, Bill Gates dropped<br/>
out of college to pursue his passions and look where he is now!  the man who<br/>
loves software and gaming is on top of the world doing something he loves<br/>
because he pursued his passions regardless of how many people thought he was<br/>
crazy)... even if they didn&#39;t have the support of others.  Now, let&#39;s think<br/>
about what the world could be like if everyone pursued their passions and<br/>
had the loving support of others and most importantly their family. <br/>
<br/>
the more I dive into unschooling and life the harder it is for me to hear<br/>
the old tapes coming out of other people&#39;s mouths.<br/>
 <br/>
why do people come here to learn about unschooling and then balk at what<br/>
they hear and go running away?<br/>

<br/>
Because they still have those tapes in their heads going a mile a <br/>
minute.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just too scary to jump into something so foreign. Nothing we say <br/>
can convince the voices in their heads to leave or shut up.<br/>
<br/>
I *know* that, &lt;g&gt; but it&#39;s still annoying. Nevertheless, their <br/>
rantings can spur us into writing and questioning. That can clarify <br/>
things enough for others who are still on the fence to jump on off into <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Annoying, but usually good in the long run.<br/>

My thoughts exactly!<br/>
Kelly you covered this so eloquently.<br/>
I&#39;ll add my rough edges..:) I know she left but someone else may benefit  <br/>
from this conversation. I was actually going to bring up &quot;unparenting&quot; ..YUCKY <br/>
 <br/>
The problem is perception.  One parents safe zone can be another&#39;s  panic <br/>
zone.<br/>
 <br/>
I see a trend in the unparenting statement. Honestly, hearing it a few  times <br/>
the last week I&#39;m seeing it as a negative insulting statement(thankfully  not <br/>
directed at me bc my bs meter has reached it&#39;s limit) .  Less  judging and <br/>
more understanding of the real crisis IF ANY. Neglect  happens, yes. However.. <br/>
more often I see parental panic/worry or even  micro-managing of small people. <br/>
Family values that cross into rules followed by  sadness and tears... Nothing <br/>
to do with unschooling...<br/>
 <br/>
In school kids do for parents,teachers,friends or their future and less for  <br/>
themselves. In unschooling they answer to themselves and or their parents(not  <br/>
adults but great practice). Their own self accountability(not guilt) of <br/>
what&#39;s  real and who&#39;s affected and is it really a good choic?. It&#39;s ok to make a  <br/>
choice that didn&#39;t turn out well. Mistakes (mis-takes as mentioned at the  <br/>
conference) are ok!<br/>
 <br/>
Honesty,trust,kindness,respect of property are useful guides.  However..every <br/>
situation doesn&#39;t mean a no it just means parents need  to be there rather <br/>
then say no bla bla bla barf.. <br/>
 <br/>
This is on my AOL page &quot;Just because one disagrees with what another does  <br/>
doesn&#39;t make the persons choice wrong it makes the critical one appear to lack  <br/>
creativity.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
If parents nag,whine complain and show their children that trust is a  <br/>
parental condition/freedom within the parental ray beam they will challenge  that at <br/>
every turn.<br/>
 <br/>
Unparenting sounds to mean = neglect, yikes... Suggesting a  parent is <br/>
neglectful doesn&#39;t help but rather blows up the communication  bridge.  I know when <br/>
I heard someone say it recently I was jaw dropped  at the passing of blame by <br/>
the actual parent who was awol, hmm. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Unschooling parents should be THE MOST attentive  parents in the world! <br/>
We should make every effort to be present WITH our  children and know <br/>
what they need and try to make that happen. Unschooling  parents should <br/>
be helping their children to manuever through rough  terrain, not <br/>
blocking the way or making it rougher. They should be letting  them know <br/>
what&#39;s acceptable and expected on different road  types---especially new <br/>
ones. We can offer maps and directions when they  ask or quietly stuff <br/>
one in a pocket---just in case. We should hold their  hands when it&#39;s <br/>
rocky or slippery and stand close by when it&#39;s smooth and  familiar. <br/>
They NEED to feel their way and even get lost every now and then  (a <br/>
great way to learn a new city, by the way!), but they don&#39;t need a  <br/>
back-seat driver or to be tugged this way and that down the  street!<br/>
<br/>
Be the partner they  need!<br/>
<br/>
Unparenting---BAH!<br/>

 <br/>
Are you truely asking this question???  The people who have been doing this<br/>
for a long time, or have always done this with their children have a HUGE<br/>
advantage over the newbies who come here looking for support.  This is a<br/>
totally new way of life, not just unschooling, but a complete change of how<br/>
to raise children and it is daunting to someone who was raised a certain way<br/>
and needs to change their whole way of thinking.  The way some of you talk,<br/>
it should be easy and natural and we are terrible parents if we don&#39;t fall<br/>
into it right away---I know you don&#39;t actually think that BUT the way some<br/>
of you respond to newbies asking questions, it sure looks as if you believe<br/>
it.  The one thing that gets me, many of you old timers tell us newbies to<br/>
be patient, to be loving and understanding and supportive---but when a<br/>
newbie parent comes here freaking out because this is new and their children<br/>
are doing the usual stuck on TV or video games and its new and scary to<br/>
them---they get chatised and judged for reacting and worrying.  I think that<br/>
people go running away because of the way they are responded to, not because<br/>
of their fear of unschooling.  If this lifestyle is about nurturing and<br/>
being supportive, why does that stop at other adults???  It sounds like so<br/>
many of you are wonderful parents but shouldn&#39;t that extend into being a<br/>
supportive human being---expecially on a list called unschooling basics???<br/>
Can&#39;t people be helped without being judged or ridiculed?  Remember, this<br/>
lifestyle doesn&#39;t come easy to everyone, some people will never be able to<br/>
get it.  But if someone comes here asking for help---I think it is in<br/>
everyone&#39;s best interest to be caring and supportive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671499532">I am one of those &quot;newbies&quot; to unschooling and a few times I *felt* attacked<br/>
but this was only my perception... not the facts.  I guess I wasn&#39;t so far<br/>
from the unschooling philosophy being a bit on the crunchy side already and<br/>
I&#39;ve always been on the edges of &quot;mainstream&quot; society.  I just needed some<br/>
shoves in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>
It is not unlike wanting to know how to be healthy, fit, and thin... but<br/>
then getting upset when you hear that it&#39;s going to take work and learning<br/>
new ways of doing things to get that.  And knowing that those that really<br/>
support you in this won&#39;t stand for whining and won&#39;t support anything you<br/>
re doing that won&#39;t get you to your goal.<br/>
<br/>
The fact is is that the newbies come here looking for answers and if you&#39;re<br/>
looking then you&#39;d better have an open mind to what you&#39;re going to hear. <br/>
And when you question the seasoned unschoolers who&#39;ve *been there done that*<br/>
then expect to have your views challenged... especially if you&#39;re looking<br/>
for some support of doing things the *old*  way.<br/>
<br/>
This is a &quot;support&quot; group for unschooling, period.  You don&#39;t have to be<br/>
around here long enough to see that the seasoned unschoolers *tell it like<br/>
it is* and won&#39;t support anything that is the *old* way of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Call it tough love or whatever... if you are coming here asking for help you<br/>
will always get it!  But if you are coming here for answers and get them and<br/>
then go on about how those answers are wrong (of implying that what we do is<br/>
un-parenting!) or won&#39;t work then be prepared for a ruckus.<br/>
<br/>
This is all IMO, of course.<br/>

 The people who have been doing this<br/>
  for a long time, or have always done this with their children have a <br/>
HUGE<br/>
 advantage over the newbies who come here looking for support. This is a<br/>
  totally new way of life, not just unschooling, but a complete change <br/>
of how<br/>
  to raise children and it is daunting to someone who was raised a <br/>
certain way<br/>
  and needs to change their whole way of thinking. The way some of you <br/>
talk,<br/>
  it should be easy and natural and we are terrible parents if we don&#39;t <br/>
fall<br/>
  into it right away---I know you don&#39;t actually think that BUT the way <br/>
some<br/>
  of you respond to newbies asking questions, it sure looks as if you <br/>
believe<br/>
 it.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  No, I believe that it&#39;s hard as hell. Simple, but not easy. Hard as <br/>
hell!<br/>
<br/>
  ANd I don&#39;t think *any* of us were raised that much differently. I&#39;d <br/>
say the majority of us (Pam S is probably the exception) were raised <br/>
traditionally with much of the same baggage.<br/>
<br/>
  Even with all the baggage I started with, I *know* it&#39;s possible! ANd <br/>
I also know that every minute you waste *fighting* it is another minute <br/>
you could have been using to enjoy your children and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 The one thing that gets me, many of you old timers tell us newbies to<br/>
 be patient, to be loving and understanding and supportive---but when a<br/>
  newbie parent comes here freaking out because this is new and their <br/>
children<br/>
 are doing the usual stuck on TV or video games and its new and scary to<br/>
 them---they get chatised and judged for reacting and worrying.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Yeah--I struggle with that. And with other contradictions in my life. <br/>
&quot;Hurry up!&quot; and &quot;Be patient---what&#39;s your hurry?&quot; I say those at the <br/>
same time &lt;g&gt; But the fact is: you only have a *very* limited amount of <br/>
time with your children. If you keep waiting, that child will be grown <br/>
and gone!<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve never met someone who has *gotten* unschooling to whine, &quot;I wish <br/>
I had waited longer to get it!&quot; It&#39;s ALWAYS, &quot;I wish I&#39;d gotten this <br/>
sooner!&quot; That includes *me*!<br/>
<br/>
  So, I want you to be patient and understanding of what your *child* is <br/>
going through---but if I&#39;m *just* as patient and understanding with <br/>
*you* (and I&#39;m really more patient and understanding than you think! <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;), you may remain *stuck* for much, much longer ---and undo all <br/>
you&#39;re working on with your child!<br/>
<br/>
  I KNOW how scary this is. but if I were to keep holding your hand and <br/>
say, &quot;It&#39;s OK, take your time&quot;....time&#39;s *gone* before you know it.<br/>
<br/>
 Don&#39;t waste another second! Fake it &#39;til you make it if you have to!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-==<br/>
<br/>
  I think that people go running away because of the way they are <br/>
responded to, not because<br/>
 of their fear of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Think again. Not many people leave this list. It&#39;s all about fear. <br/>
Fearing the unknown, what&#39;s different, what&#39;s strange. We all have <br/>
fears, but wallowing in them---especially with unschooling---will not <br/>
take you further on the journey.<br/>
<br/>
  Relatively speaking (! &lt;g&gt;) this is the gentlest place to figure this <br/>
out. But if you think understanding unschooling is hard, try explaining <br/>
it to family, friends, and strangers.<br/>
<br/>
  This is NOT a journey for wimps! You really DO have to be strong to <br/>
stand up for your kids.<br/>
<br/>
  If they run away because they can&#39;t handle *my* heat &lt;g&gt;, they <br/>
probably couldn&#39;t stand up to a Mil&#39;s or a neighbor&#39;s heat---or even <br/>
their own selves!<br/>
<br/>
  Not that that&#39;s my goal (to chase them away), but this is NOT easy! It <br/>
takes a certain personality to handle being on the outside almost *all* <br/>
the time (except at conferences! &lt;G&gt;)!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  If this lifestyle is about nurturing and being supportive, why does <br/>
that stop at other adults???<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 First: I ain&#39;t your mama!<br/>
<br/>
  Second: I&#39;m happy to nurture and support, but only if you&#39;re working <br/>
towards the goal. If you&#39;re fighting every step of the way, I&#39;ll let <br/>
you stop---and even run back to where it&#39;s safe. I can&#39;t stop you! <br/>
*Many* people can&#39;t or won&#39;t make this trip. They&#39;re not strong enough. <br/>
They have too much baggage and can&#39;t drop any of it by the side of the <br/>
road.<br/>
<br/>
  I only want to help those who are *interested* in changing. I can&#39;t <br/>
make you follow me. I *can* make this path seem attractive enough for <br/>
you, smoother, and with fewer rocks. I can show you ways to lighten <br/>
your load. I can help toss shit aside. I can give you some tips on how <br/>
to breathe better or work your legs a bit to build up muscles you never <br/>
knew you had. I can give you songs to whistle! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I can tell you that I&#39;ve been on this road before and I can ease your <br/>
fears about what&#39;s around the next corner. BUT! You have to *want* to <br/>
go there! You have to *want* to make the change. I&#39;m not going to pull <br/>
you along or even carry you. YOU have to take the steps.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess I could stop and sit down with you and hold your hand and <br/>
commiserate with how hard the journey is, but that won&#39;t get you *any* <br/>
further along. It slows you down. And if I commiserate long <br/>
enough---you may simply decide that the journey&#39;s been long enough and <br/>
put a leaky tent up right where you are. There&#39;s a beautiful, sparkling <br/>
unschooling city *just* around the corner. But I can&#39;t make you go <br/>
there. It&#39;s up to *YOU*.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  It sounds like so many of you are wonderful parents but shouldn&#39;t that <br/>
extend into being a<br/>
  supportive human being---expecially on a list called unschooling <br/>
basics???<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Really, Leslie, if you&#39;re not getting the help you&#39;re looking for <br/>
here, you don&#39;t have to stay. If you feel you can do a better job, you <br/>
can form your own list. It&#39;s a lot easier to sit on the sidewalks and <br/>
watch others get pushed beyond what they ever felt possible while <br/>
criticizing the coaches than it is to show up every day and help people <br/>
on the journey---but hey---whatever floats your boat.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Can&#39;t people be helped without being judged or ridiculed?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
  Sure. On your list. Especially if what you&#39;re seeing here is judgment <br/>
and ridicule.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Remember, this lifestyle doesn&#39;t come easy to everyone, some people <br/>
will never be able to<br/>
  get it. But if someone comes here asking for help---I think it is in <br/>
everyone&#39;s best interest to be caring and supportive.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 The people who won&#39;t ever get it will leave. That&#39;s what they do.<br/>
<br/>
  If someone comes here looking for help, she&#39;ll hang around, try some <br/>
of the suggestions, work harder, see the lights below, and struggle to <br/>
make it.<br/>
<br/>
  I can worry about those who won&#39;t ever get it OR I can focus on the <br/>
ones that are working *hard* every day to reach the goal.<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m not a worrier. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

This is a &quot;support&quot; group for unschooling, period.  You don&#39;t have to be<br/>
around here long enough to see that the seasoned unschoolers *tell it <br/>
like<br/>
it is* and won&#39;t support anything that is the *old* way of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Correction: This is NOT actually a support group. If you feel <br/>
supported, GREAT! But that&#39;s not really the goal.<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to discuss unschooling and to help beginners take the very <br/>
difficult steps to get there.<br/>
<br/>
To paraphrase Joyce:  The goal is to understand unschooling. Support is <br/>
a side effect! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;ve seen some other boards and lists that have &quot;ripped a new one&quot; to<br/>
newbies posting and questioning unschooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
I think that most people wonder into unschooling through homeschooling<br/>
thinking that this is just another curriculum choice.  What they may truly<br/>
be looking for is &quot;Interest Led Learning&quot; or &quot;Child Directed Learning&quot; not<br/>
realizing that *Unschooling* is more than a curriculum choice.  They still<br/>
want to make sure that their kids have all their 3R&#39;s covered as well as<br/>
some science, geography and politcal science thrown in.  So while we that<br/>
have become comfortable with *unschooling* can see that *everything* is a<br/>
learning experience (even if we don&#39;t categorize it as such), others want<br/>
learning to be everything.  IOW they want to make sure that their child is<br/>
learning something &quot;educational.&quot; So I think that this list does get a lot<br/>
of traffic from people who are looking for something different.  And that is<br/>
fine.  Just don&#39;t mess up the list by condemning all unschoolers as<br/>
&quot;unparents.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Having been in &quot;the system&quot; for several years before coming to homeschooling<br/>
and eventually unschooling, I can tell you that there is a whole lot more<br/>
&quot;unparenting&quot; going on in traditional mainstream homes these days than in<br/>
unschooling homes.  Parents who are allowing &quot;the system&quot; to raise their<br/>
children and aren&#39;t taking responsibility for poor behaviour, teen<br/>
pregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse and bullying.  Their children truly are<br/>
becoming &quot;zombie faced&quot; in front of the tv&#39;s because there is no life beyond<br/>
school and &quot;the box.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-48450110">Thank you Kelly, for your responses!  I have gotten some really great advice<br/>
and help here which I have used, I just hate to see when a mother comes<br/>
here, panicked and scared and she&#39;s accused of being neglectful to her<br/>
kids---which did happen in a recent thread.  That is what gets me---but I do<br/>
see your point about being patient and understanding with adults---yes, many<br/>
of them would stay stuck if they were treated with kid gloves---with this<br/>
lifestyle its either do it or don&#39;t do it---waffling certainly doesn&#39;t help<br/>
anyone.<br/>
 <br/>
This is a great list, I have learned a lot from all of you and hope to<br/>
continue learning more---I just feel bad for parents sometimes, who come<br/>
here scared and leave just as scared because they are questioned--sometimes<br/>
quite harshly.  But I see your point.  And no, I do not want or need to<br/>
start my own list, I am new to all this, I couldn&#39;t offer much of anything<br/>
since I am still working on myself in this life change.<br/>

<br/>
The people who have been doing this<br/>
  for a long time, or have always done this with their children have a <br/>
HUGE<br/>
advantage over the newbies who come here looking for support. This is a<br/>
  totally new way of life, not just unschooling, but a complete change <br/>
of how<br/>
  to raise children and it is daunting to someone who was raised a <br/>
certain way<br/>
  and needs to change their whole way of thinking. The way some of you <br/>
talk,<br/>
  it should be easy and natural and we are terrible parents if we don&#39;t <br/>
fall<br/>
  into it right away---I know you don&#39;t actually think that BUT the way <br/>
some<br/>
  of you respond to newbies asking questions, it sure looks as if you <br/>
believe<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  No, I believe that it&#39;s hard as hell. Simple, but not easy. Hard as <br/>
hell!<br/>
<br/>
  ANd I don&#39;t think *any* of us were raised that much differently. I&#39;d <br/>
say the majority of us (Pam S is probably the exception) were raised <br/>
traditionally with much of the same baggage.<br/>
<br/>
  Even with all the baggage I started with, I *know* it&#39;s possible! ANd <br/>
I also know that every minute you waste *fighting* it is another minute <br/>
you could have been using to enjoy your children and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The one thing that gets me, many of you old timers tell us newbies to<br/>
be patient, to be loving and understanding and supportive---but when a<br/>
  newbie parent comes here freaking out because this is new and their <br/>
children<br/>
are doing the usual stuck on TV or video games and its new and scary to<br/>
them---they get chatised and judged for reacting and worrying.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Yeah--I struggle with that. And with other contradictions in my life. <br/>
&quot;Hurry up!&quot; and &quot;Be patient---what&#39;s your hurry?&quot; I say those at the <br/>
same time &lt;g&gt; But the fact is: you only have a *very* limited amount of <br/>
time with your children. If you keep waiting, that child will be grown <br/>
and gone!<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve never met someone who has *gotten* unschooling to whine, &quot;I wish <br/>
I had waited longer to get it!&quot; It&#39;s ALWAYS, &quot;I wish I&#39;d gotten this <br/>
sooner!&quot; That includes *me*!<br/>
<br/>
  So, I want you to be patient and understanding of what your *child* is <br/>
going through---but if I&#39;m *just* as patient and understanding with <br/>
*you* (and I&#39;m really more patient and understanding than you think! <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;), you may remain *stuck* for much, much longer ---and undo all <br/>
you&#39;re working on with your child!<br/>
<br/>
  I KNOW how scary this is. but if I were to keep holding your hand and <br/>
say, &quot;It&#39;s OK, take your time&quot;....time&#39;s *gone* before you know it.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t waste another second! Fake it &#39;til you make it if you have to!<br/>
<br/>
-=-==<br/>
<br/>
  I think that people go running away because of the way they are <br/>
responded to, not because<br/>
of their fear of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Think again. Not many people leave this list. It&#39;s all about fear. <br/>
Fearing the unknown, what&#39;s different, what&#39;s strange. We all have <br/>
fears, but wallowing in them---especially with unschooling---will not <br/>
take you further on the journey.<br/>
<br/>
  Relatively speaking (! &lt;g&gt;) this is the gentlest place to figure this <br/>
out. But if you think understanding unschooling is hard, try explaining <br/>
it to family, friends, and strangers.<br/>
<br/>
  This is NOT a journey for wimps! You really DO have to be strong to <br/>
stand up for your kids.<br/>
<br/>
  If they run away because they can&#39;t handle *my* heat &lt;g&gt;, they <br/>
probably couldn&#39;t stand up to a Mil&#39;s or a neighbor&#39;s heat---or even <br/>
their own selves!<br/>
<br/>
  Not that that&#39;s my goal (to chase them away), but this is NOT easy! It <br/>
takes a certain personality to handle being on the outside almost *all* <br/>
the time (except at conferences! &lt;G&gt;)!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  If this lifestyle is about nurturing and being supportive, why does <br/>
that stop at other adults???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
First: I ain&#39;t your mama!<br/>
<br/>
  Second: I&#39;m happy to nurture and support, but only if you&#39;re working <br/>
towards the goal. If you&#39;re fighting every step of the way, I&#39;ll let <br/>
you stop---and even run back to where it&#39;s safe. I can&#39;t stop you! <br/>
*Many* people can&#39;t or won&#39;t make this trip. They&#39;re not strong enough. <br/>
They have too much baggage and can&#39;t drop any of it by the side of the <br/>
road.<br/>
<br/>
  I only want to help those who are *interested* in changing. I can&#39;t <br/>
make you follow me. I *can* make this path seem attractive enough for <br/>
you, smoother, and with fewer rocks. I can show you ways to lighten <br/>
your load. I can help toss shit aside. I can give you some tips on how <br/>
to breathe better or work your legs a bit to build up muscles you never <br/>
knew you had. I can give you songs to whistle! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I can tell you that I&#39;ve been on this road before and I can ease your <br/>
fears about what&#39;s around the next corner. BUT! You have to *want* to <br/>
go there! You have to *want* to make the change. I&#39;m not going to pull <br/>
you along or even carry you. YOU have to take the steps.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess I could stop and sit down with you and hold your hand and <br/>
commiserate with how hard the journey is, but that won&#39;t get you *any* <br/>
further along. It slows you down. And if I commiserate long <br/>
enough---you may simply decide that the journey&#39;s been long enough and <br/>
put a leaky tent up right where you are. There&#39;s a beautiful, sparkling <br/>
unschooling city *just* around the corner. But I can&#39;t make you go <br/>
there. It&#39;s up to *YOU*.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  It sounds like so many of you are wonderful parents but shouldn&#39;t that <br/>

  Really, Leslie, if you&#39;re not getting the help you&#39;re looking for <br/>
here, you don&#39;t have to stay. If you feel you can do a better job, you <br/>
can form your own list. It&#39;s a lot easier to sit on the sidewalks and <br/>

<br/>
  Sure. On your list. Especially if what you&#39;re seeing here is judgment <br/>

  Remember, this lifestyle doesn&#39;t come easy to everyone, some people <br/>

everyone&#39;s best interest to be caring and supportive.<br/>
<br/>

The people who won&#39;t ever get it will leave. That&#39;s what they do.<br/>
<br/>
  If someone comes here looking for help, she&#39;ll hang around, try some <br/>
of the suggestions, work harder, see the lights below, and struggle to <br/>
make it.<br/>
<br/>
  I can worry about those who won&#39;t ever get it OR I can focus on the <br/>
ones that are working *hard* every day to reach the goal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a worrier. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-347552358">On 6/2/06, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kbcdlovejo@...">kbcdlovejo@...</a> &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kbcdlovejo@...">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Relatively speaking (! &lt;g&gt;) this is the gentlest place to figure this<br/>
&gt; out. But if you think understanding unschooling is hard, try explaining<br/>
&gt; it to family, friends, and strangers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;ve seen some other boards and lists that have &quot;ripped a new one&quot; to<br/>
newbies posting and questioning unschooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
I think that most people wonder into unschooling through homeschooling<br/>
thinking that this is just another curriculum choice.  What they may truly<br/>
be looking for is &quot;Interest Led Learning&quot; or &quot;Child Directed Learning&quot; not<br/>
realizing that *Unschooling* is more than a curriculum choice.  They still<br/>
want to make sure that their kids have all their 3R&#39;s covered as well as<br/>
some science, geography and politcal science thrown in.  So while we that<br/>
have become comfortable with *unschooling* can see that *everything* is a<br/>
learning experience (even if we don&#39;t categorize it as such), others want<br/>
learning to be everything.  IOW they want to make sure that their child is<br/>
learning something &quot;educational.&quot; So I think that this list does get a lot<br/>
of traffic from people who are looking for something different.  And that is<br/>
fine.  Just don&#39;t mess up the list by condemning all unschoolers as<br/>
&quot;unparents.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Having been in &quot;the system&quot; for several years before coming to homeschooling<br/>
and eventually unschooling, I can tell you that there is a whole lot more<br/>
&quot;unparenting&quot; going on in traditional mainstream homes these days than in<br/>
unschooling homes.  Parents who are allowing &quot;the system&quot; to raise their<br/>
children and aren&#39;t taking responsibility for poor behaviour, teen<br/>
pregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse and bullying.  Their children truly are<br/>
becoming &quot;zombie faced&quot; in front of the tv&#39;s because there is no life beyond<br/>
school and &quot;the box.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-709799548">I just hate to see when a mother comes<br/>
here, panicked and scared and she&#39;s accused of being neglectful to her<br/>
kids---which did happen in a recent thread.<br/>
*****No, I don&#39;t think it did. I may be wrong, can you quote that?<br/>
What I understood to be said was, 4 years of TV and video games, with no other valid choices (valid to those doing the choosing - in this case, that would be the kids) and nothing better offered is neglect.<br/>
No one here said, You are a neglectful mother.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958465227"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I believe Tresa&#39;s already left the list---not unexpectedly IMO<br/>
&gt; after she sent *this* post! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s very interesting to know.  She&#39;s obviously not ready to be an <br/>
unschooler.  I used to have the same concerns, as did many of us <br/>
probably, and it&#39;s only just recently been truly sinking in to the <br/>
very core of my being.  I now fight with my children for time on <br/>
Nintendo.  *grin*  <br/>
<br/>
disclaimer:  obviously we don&#39;t really fight.  But my son and I are <br/>
the most avid gamers in the family and he truly enjoys watching and <br/>
helping me play.  We were up to 1:15am playing Paper Mario.  They <br/>
weren&#39;t ready to go to bed but my eyes were starting to close and I <br/>
couldn&#39;t keep Mario functioning!  *lol*  At least I outlasted my <br/>
dd14.  She fell asleep on the floor next to me.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220929918">***The people who have been doing this<br/>
for a long time, or have always done this with their children have a HUGE<br/>
advantage over the newbies who come here looking for support. ***<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all living on the same planet with access to a lot of information. <br/>
 I think the people new to unschooling today have the advantage.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t have Internet access until Dylan was seven or eight years old. <br/>
There was one unschooling magazine, &quot;Growing Without Schooling,&quot; and one<br/>
unschooling article by Sandra Dodd, in an otherwise homeschooly<br/>
publication.   Anyone even remotely interested in unschooling today will<br/>
get 456,000 Google hits from one search.   There&#39;s Life Learning Magazine<br/>
and Live Free Learn Free.  There&#39;s the e-zine Connections.  There&#39;s the<br/>
.info unschooling message board and web site. There are web sites and<br/>
blogs up the wazoo.   <br/>
<br/>
***The one thing that gets me, many of you old timers tell us newbies to<br/>
be patient, to be loving and understanding and supportive---but when a<br/>
newbie parent comes here freaking out because this is new and their<br/>
children<br/>
are doing the usual stuck on TV or video games and its new and scary to<br/>
them---they get chatised and judged for reacting and worrying. ***<br/>
<br/>
The responsibility to do the initial research, to discover if unschooling<br/>
seems like something they can do, lies with the newbie.   It&#39;s not our<br/>
job to convince them.  It&#39;s not our responsibility to make sure they get<br/>
all the information.   We can help people understand how the principles<br/>
apply to real life situations.   <br/>
<br/>
***If this lifestyle is about nurturing and<br/>
being supportive, why does that stop at other adults???  ***  <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t and many, many people get the support and help they need at<br/>
these types of lists.   But some people want more than that.  They want<br/>
us to do the work for them and that isn&#39;t possible.    <br/>
<br/>
Anyone who takes even one hour out of their day to respond on these lists<br/>
is spending that hour with an adult who could feasibly get that<br/>
information reading at anyone of the various web sites or in the archives<br/>
of these great lists.   That&#39;s an hour away from our own kids.  We&#39;re<br/>
mostly glad to do it because we *do* remember how alone we felt in the<br/>
beginning, how hard it was for us to find information.   But it&#39;s<br/>
different now.  There&#39;s a lot of information available for free.    We<br/>
don&#39;t need to be as nurturing with an adult who&#39;s had years of experience<br/>
navigating in this world and who has Internet access as we need to be<br/>
with our kids.   I&#39;m not afraid to say it right up front.  I don&#39;t feel<br/>
the need to nurture anyone on these lists in the same way I feel the need<br/>
to nurture my kid.  List members have other resources available to them<br/>
but my kid has only one mom. <br/>
<br/>
***I think it is in everyone&#39;s best interest to be caring and<br/>
supportive.***<br/>
<br/>
And I think the people who volunteer on this list are the most caring and<br/>
supportive people around.   This list wouldn&#39;t even exists if  Kelly and<br/>
Ren didn&#39;t care.   It&#39;s because they care they give away their time.  <br/>
<br/>
And while I will always be supportive of unschooling I don&#39;t have any<br/>
responsibility to be supportive of mom&#39;s who are too afraid or too whiny<br/>
to do the internal work they need to do to really understand the<br/>
principles of unschooling.   I&#39;m not interested in being supportive of<br/>
people who don&#39;t want to (or who make excuses about why they can&#39;t)<br/>
unschool.   I&#39;m not going to hunt them down and obliterate them,&lt;g&gt; but<br/>
I&#39;m not going to spend my time (because I have no time advantage&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
digging around inside them looking for the &quot;on&quot; switch.   I think they<br/>
should have flipped it before they came here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is meta-discussion.   My answer as moderator to a violation of list<br/>
policy is to put anyone who continues this on moderation and stop those<br/>
posts at the queue.     My answer to you in particular is this:   Post<br/>
the way you think is best.  Offer the support and nurturing you think<br/>
each particular newbie needs.  Be the positive force you want to see<br/>
here.   If that still isn&#39;t good enough, start your own list of nurturing<br/>
support and feel free to advertise the link here.   Then, when you see<br/>
someone here in need of your kind of list you can direct them there.  <br/>
That would be one more resource for newbies that those advantaged<br/>
old-timers didn&#39;t have. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Some people think it means just shucking formal curriculum but still <br/>
covering core subjects in a relaxed manner.  Some people think it <br/>
means letting the child schedule themselves with textbooks without the <br/>
parent hovering over them.  <br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling is very misunderstood.  I know the very first time <br/>
I heard about it, I absolutely loved the idea of making things easier <br/>
on myself by throwing out our schedules but after a few months of my <br/>
children doing nothing but playing, I assumed we weren&#39;t the <br/>
unschooling types.  I truly expected that after a while the kids would <br/>
ask to do schoolwork.  I just didn&#39;t really understand unschooling.  I <br/>
had joined some groups like this one, maybe even this one as well, and <br/>
as I learned more, I had no confidence in either my children nor <br/>
myself to just let go of the way I thought things should be.  <br/>
<br/>
Boy, I wish I knew what I know now.  But I guess this is something <br/>
that is just so radical that it can take a while to really sink in.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been sinking myself into unschooling for 4 months and as summer <br/>
is hitting, I&#39;m seeing people gearing up for the Fall.  I&#39;ve had some <br/>
twinges of doubt, and longing for curriculum (I&#39;m a former curriculum <br/>
junkie) but every time I start looking at stuff for sale, it just all <br/>
looks so stupid and so wrong.  I&#39;m thinking that maybe I&#39;m finally <br/>
getting it and living it.  It feels so good and I don&#39;t want to lose <br/>
this feeling.  :)<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m still reading all the posts, but wanted to respond here.   SO <br/>
many of you have expressed things in a way I agree with.  Being a <br/>
newbie, I wanted to add that when I first saw the word unschooling, <br/>
I thought &quot;NO WAY!&quot;.  (for the record, I initially thought that way <br/>
about homeschooling, &quot;no way could I be at home teaching my daughter <br/>
all day!&quot;).  BUT, that was because I knew VERY LITTLE about <br/>
homeschooling and other options.   SO, being the reader and digger <br/>
that I am, I started my internet searches, reading every book I <br/>
could get my hands on (amazon.com loves me!  I borrowed some from <br/>
the library, but I love to own them so I can make notes in the <br/>
margins if so moved, underline passages etc).   I kept coming across <br/>
unschooling, pushed it aside, came across it again and again.   Even <br/>
though I initially thought no way, there was something that stuck <br/>
with me, especially after reading Dumbing us Down (John Holt and <br/>
John Taylor Gatto especially made the lightbulb go off).   <br/>
<br/>
It took about 2 years of reading, absorbing, mind altering, before I <br/>
found this group (I actually started on one of those &quot;more critical&quot; <br/>
groups someone alluded to here and was &quot;criticized&quot; on my first <br/>
post.  I was pissed, but I now realize I needed to become more <br/>
familiar with unschooling, and to work on changing my perceptions <br/>
about unschooling, I really had NO CLUE, especially radical <br/>
unschooling.   Yes, it&#39;s very misunderstood unless you do the work <br/>
to really get it.  <br/>
<br/>
Change is hard.   I feel that those who have posted and attacked <br/>
here don&#39;t know much about unschooling, and as Kelly and others have <br/>
stated, want the group to lead them through it.   You have to do the <br/>
work yourself.   You have to be ready to make the shift in how you <br/>
live your lives, and get past your past and how YOU were brought <br/>
up.   I agree that there are some people who won&#39;t ever be able to <br/>
do that, you have to WANT to change and live your life more freely.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll admit that sometimes in the past I have felt envious of those <br/>
here who have &quot;always unschooled&quot;, but I&#39;ve found the more I read, <br/>
the more natural it feels.   In order to hear the advice so freely <br/>
given here (and I&#39;ll add my thank you for being here to the others!)<br/>
I have to continue to work on it on my end.<br/>
<br/>
Many things have been swirling around in my head recently that I&#39;ve <br/>
been wanting to express but have felt SO foggy!   So many of you <br/>
have written things that have helped me through this blah period <br/>
(and this after just attending my first conference!  Go figure - <br/>
I&#39;ll blame it on PMS).  I don&#39;t always have eloquent things to say, <br/>
but I DO get SO MUCH from what others write.  This is one newbie who <br/>
is very grateful this group is here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214856096">&quot;2) Thanks to Ren :) dd&#39;s favorite phrase all this week has been<br/>
&quot;Yeah, Mom,why not?&quot;   We haven&#39;t found a reason &quot;Why not&quot; for<br/>
anything yet!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE it!!!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;3)DH completely agrees with unschooling.  He had so many &quot;wow&quot;<br/>
moments.  His main concern right now is his son, as he&#39;s at a critical<br/>
time in his life.  DH was so impressed and genuinely touched by the<br/>
advice and real concern he received from the other guys, especially. <br/>
He said after we left &quot;I miss them already&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I SO enjoyed hanging out with you both and chatting in the lobby.<br/>
You&#39;re both amazing people and your dh is so open to learning about<br/>
all of it. I could just see that sweet look in his eyes all weekend,<br/>
like there was nourishment all around. *I* was certainly nourished by<br/>
all the joy in that place!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;4) Stepson realized that he now has a choice, providing he&#39;s allowed<br/>
to go to school after his hearing, which in itself is enormous<br/>
empowerment.  He also realized that school shouldn&#39;t define him and<br/>
all that goes with that knowledge.  He attended some of the talks with<br/>
his dad and liked Ben&#39;s &quot;Dad&quot; talk especially.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is really great to hear! At least if he chooses school, he will<br/>
be SO empowered compared to most kids there. What a gift you&#39;ve given<br/>
him. <br/>
   <br/>
&quot;5) I learned that solar flares are one of the causes of the northern<br/>
lights, which are like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen (but will someday) in<br/>
Alaska. This only stuck with me because my stepson was doing a report<br/>
on solar flares as part of the school work he was missing while<br/>
suspended. True to Ren&#39;s &quot;Chocolate&quot; talk. Connections.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gotta LOVE those connections. They never cease to amaze me.:)<br/>
I recieved an article from Christine at the conference, a piece about<br/>
chocolate that she ran across the day I did my talk. Later, Ben, Kelly<br/>
and I were shopping at Trader Joes and Kelly found some Chocolate<br/>
flavored tea, which I HAD to bring home of course.<br/>
Then yesterday, I found out that some training I&#39;ll be doing with MAC<br/>
in a couple of weeks, will take place in Asheville. The location for<br/>
training is right next to &quot;Chocolate Fetish&quot; a place another coworker<br/>
told me about before the conference. I&#39;m going to try the Wasabe<br/>
chocolate for sure!!  Too cool.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;6)We all made connections with interesting, positive, passionate<br/>
people and are really hoping to go to NM.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You just summed up the amazing effects of the conferences on each of<br/>
our lives. I have made life-long friendships (some of them based on<br/>
Godiva Liqueur....yeah, I can be rather shallow), learned tons of new<br/>
things and grown in so many ways.<br/>
Can&#39;t wait to see you all again!!!<br/>

If I didn&#39;t, I will now! She appears to be a neglectful mother.<br/>
<br/>
If you truly believe that only watching tv and playing videos for four <br/>
years is OK until one day you finally believe it&#39;s enough---something <br/>
ain&#39;t right. Of course, that&#39;s assuming that was *all* the children did <br/>
for four years.<br/>
<br/>
ANd one was pale, weak, and ---what was the other word? and the other <br/>
was obese---something ain&#39;t right. Was she offering nothing but <br/>
nutritionless food to one and only high calorie food to the other? <br/>
Genetics and illness aside, what&#39;s up with this picture?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing it wasn&#39;t all it appeared to be. I&#39;m guessing that she was <br/>
only giving us part of her story. But we can only go by what is offered.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s just ging to throw out such info and say that she tried it and <br/>
it doesn&#39;t work---and then *leave*---we can use her story as an example <br/>
of what unschooling is NOT. From what she told us, she was neglectful, <br/>
not mindful, and not unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351769081">&lt;Having been in &quot;the system&quot; for several years before coming to <br/>
homeschooling and eventually unschooling, I can tell you that there is <br/>
a whole lot more &quot;unparenting&quot; going on in traditional mainstream <br/>
homes these days than in unschooling homes.  Parents who are <br/>
allowing &quot;the system&quot; to raise their children and aren&#39;t taking <br/>
responsibility for poor behaviour, teen pregnancy, drug and alcohol <br/>
abuse and bullying.  Their children truly are becoming &quot;zombie faced&quot; <br/>
in front of the tv&#39;s because there is no life beyond school and &quot;the <br/>
box.&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a VERY valid point.  I&#39;ve always felt that way, but I have <br/>
never been able to put it into words so well.  I agree 100%!  That, my <br/>
friends, is what makes me sad.  My heart actually aches for these <br/>
children.  I always said it was like feeding them to the sharks.<br/>

I&#39;m a relative newcomer to this list, though not to unschooling, as we have <br/>
3 children, ages 7 and under, who&#39;ve been attachment parented and loved and <br/>
trusted and respected since birth.<br/>
When I read the &#39;old timers&#39; responses to newcomers fears, I don&#39;t hear what <br/>
you are hearing at all.  I think we all perceive things, and receive things <br/>
according to our own existing paradigms.  What I do notice about myself, is <br/>
that when I hear or experience something that really &#39;gets to me&#39;, then I <br/>
know I have some serious examining to do with that issue, that THAT is MY <br/>
stuff and not the responsiblity of someone else to say it the way *I* think <br/>
I need to hear it.<br/>
