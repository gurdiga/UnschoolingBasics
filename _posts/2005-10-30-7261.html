<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839063493">~I prefer to be a little more &quot;in your face&quot; about unschooling~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t let this pass...<br/>
This is what email lists and the conference do for people y&#39;all!!!:)<br/>
<br/>
My sister wouldn&#39;t read at the lists for YEARS, in spite of my pushing<br/>
a wee bit every now and then. I just KNEW she&#39;d get it deep down if<br/>
she had people to refine and strengthen her views with.<br/>
She WASN&#39;T very bold or &quot;in your face&quot; for a long time. This year,<br/>
that all changed.;)<br/>
<br/>
So I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is; keep posting, keep reading, keep<br/>
thinking if you DO want to get bold about unschooling. It works.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and come to the Live and Learn conference next year!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42127606">*I have an unschooling friend whose children just always go along. <br/>
In fact,<br/>
she can get away with doing some math worksheets and teachy things <br/>
because<br/>
her children are quite happy to do nearly anything she asks. It <br/>
isn&#39;t that she<br/>
<br/>
never considers her children, it is just that she rarely *has* to.*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Does she ever ask her kids &quot;Would you like to do these math <br/>
worksheets?&quot;  The problem I see with this is that just because kids <br/>
are &quot;compliant&quot; doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t seething with resentment <br/>
inside.  My little sister was extremely compliant and seemingly had <br/>
the least amount of resentments during our childhood, but now she <br/>
has found her voice and she is ANGRY at many things.  She complied <br/>
but she was not happy about complying; she just couldn&#39;t find her <br/>
voice to express that. <br/>
<br/>
I would never tell my kids &quot;Let&#39;s do these worksheets&quot;, to me that <br/>
is SO not unschooling!  Now, if my kids came to me and said, &quot;These <br/>
math worksheets are really interesting, I would really like to do <br/>
them, would you help me?&quot;, that is unchooling, although, the <br/>
worksheet thing is so schooly.  When children are willing to do <br/>
anything the parent asks it worries me that they don&#39;t know how to <br/>
think for themselves or that they don&#39;t really have a voice in their <br/>
house, it makes me wonder if they are really unschooled.  I want my <br/>
kids to have a voice so I ask them quite frequently &quot;Is this what <br/>
you want to do or are you doing it because that is what everyone <br/>
else wants to do?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
*It isn&#39;t that she never considers her childern, it is just that she <br/>
rarely *has* to.........*  <br/>
<br/>
To me unschooling is ALWAYS considering your children!  I would <br/>
never tolerate my husband to tell me &quot;We are going to this football <br/>
game today&quot; without asking me first if that is what I want to do.  <br/>
At the same time, I wouldn&#39;t want to do that to my children.  They <br/>
deserve the same respect that we give any human being.  That is <br/>
actually something that really helped me transit to radical <br/>
unschooling also, I would constantly ask myself &quot;Would I do this to <br/>
my husband?, or my dad, or my friend.........&quot;  If the answer was no <br/>
I would have to reconsider what I was doing.  It is also good to go <br/>
back and time and remember how we felt when our parents did certain <br/>
things arbitrarily.<br/>

 <br/>
I agree with you Heidi!  She is not interested in becoming a radical  <br/>
unschooler, her life works just fine for her.  I hope her children will not  become <br/>
angry older kids/adults because they don&#39;t always have much say in their  lives.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s why I said that in a way I&#39;m glad my children are so  opinionated!  <br/>
They probably would be in school.  Almost everyone I  know that&#39;s not a radical <br/>
unschooler has never read a parenting book or had to  challenge their way of <br/>
parenting.  I had to nearly from the  moment my son was born.  I have always <br/>
wondered if I would have ever found  unschooling if my kids were just like <br/>
everyone else&#39;s.  No one else I know  thinks there is anything &quot;wrong&quot; with their <br/>
lives, because everyone has the same  issues (bedtime struggles, tv time, <br/>
school trouble).  They don&#39;t  know the freedom is out there, I doubt I would have <br/>
either.<br/>
 <br/>
My friend is a somewhat unschooler because she believes in this form of  <br/>
education, but she has never wanted to set her children free nor has she found  <br/>
herself in a difficult enough situation to question herself.  <br/>

Gotcha Leslie!  I am forgetting that this is unschooling basics not <br/>
unschooling discussions!  My mind thinks in terms of &quot;radical <br/>
unschooling&quot; so I guess I need to step back here.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you think that some of the reason your kids share their <br/>
opinions is that they are allowed to?  So many kids are squashed <br/>
when they try to express, not only their opinions, but any kind of <br/>
emotion that the adult deems uncomfortable.<br/>

LOL!  Maybe just a little.  My son, now nine, is like Ren&#39;s Jalen  (is that <br/>
right, my brain hasn&#39;t been good with names lately).   No  squashing could ever <br/>
be accomplished, even if you tried.<br/>
 <br/>
When Nick was little, I was tired and complaining about some mess he was  <br/>
always making.  My friend said nastily &quot;haven&#39;t you ever thought about  saying <br/>
&#39;no&#39;?&quot;.  I realized then that I was going to have to be a very  smart, involved <br/>
parent..... her child actually quit doing something when she  said &#39;no&#39;???? <br/>
 <br/>
My mom said the other day about my daughter, &quot;I suppose we would have all  <br/>
been free like that had we been raised without so many rules.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
And by the way, I&#39;m not a new unschooler, just a poor conveyor of  ideas!  :) <br/>
 Feel free to call my attention to non-unschooling  statements I make.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-598381651">&lt;&lt;and what would be wrong with being free&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Last month, my daughters and I were at a women&#39;s spirituality retreat for several days.  There was a talent show and the girls sang some songs.  There were about 15 girls in age from 2 to 14 up on stage in varying stages of &quot;nekkid&quot; (it was a female only retreat and temps were over 100).  The girls had been in the pool for days so their hair was wild.  They were painted like natives and some wore fairy wings.<br/>
<br/>
They sang a song, chins thrust out, about:<br/>
<br/>
I am my mother&#39;s savage daughter<br/>
the one who runs barefoot cursing sharp stones<br/>
I am my mother&#39;s savage daughter<br/>
I&#39;ll not cut my hair, I&#39;ll not lower my voice.<br/>
<br/>
I cried it was so beautiful to me.  An older woman turned to me and said &quot;My, how my life might have been different if I had been singing that song at that age.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718798833">Rebecca,<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned &quot;overthinking&quot;...is that really possible?:) Thinking is<br/>
such good mental gymnastics. I&#39;m not suggesting parents question their<br/>
every move, but sometimes in the beginning of the radical unschooling<br/>
transition, that&#39;s exactly what helps.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what this list is for. Thinking, examining and questioning<br/>
deeply what we believed as truth in the past. Through this questioning<br/>
and thinking, many,many lives have been changed.<br/>
<br/>
People on this very list can tell you, myself included, how this<br/>
&quot;overthinking&quot; has completely changed how we view children, the world,<br/>
learning and parenting on every level. We can tell you that we&#39;ve<br/>
reached deeper and more meaningful relationship levels, watched<br/>
learning blossom in joy and peace and developed trust that is unshakeable.<br/>
<br/>
Healing happens here. And thinking, examining and re-examining is part<br/>
of that healing process.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you were loading up your van to go run errands, and a child<br/>
expressed unhappiness, you&#39;d just keep moving forward, with no regards<br/>
to their feelings? That isn&#39;t healthy for any relationship.<br/>
Yes, there are times you really NEED to go do something...maybe the<br/>
power is going to get shut off if you don&#39;t go pay a bill, maybe<br/>
everyone is really, really hungry and you&#39;re out of food.....but how<br/>
often is an errand THAT important?<br/>
Even if it is, the child&#39;s feelings can be honored. &quot;I am really sorry<br/>
we have to go do x,y,z, when you&#39;d rather stay home, I need to do this<br/>
because___________ and we can bring ___________along to make it more fun&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we don&#39;t see life as &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; and &quot;shoulds&quot; it opens the door<br/>
for CREATIVITY! We can creatively meet everyone&#39;s needs...maybe not at<br/>
the same time, but honoring those feelings is SO important.<br/>
<br/>
I always ask myself what I would do if Markus (my dh) said he didn&#39;t<br/>
want to go....I certainly wouldn&#39;t ignore his feelings, yk?<br/>
BUT, children can&#39;t always just be left home at younger ages, and<br/>
there isn&#39;t always a solution that&#39;s readily available, that&#39;s when<br/>
creativity shines!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll read here about parents that forego errands to honor their<br/>
child&#39;s feelings, you&#39;ll read about people that DO involve their<br/>
children in day to day decisions, you&#39;ll read about parents that trust<br/>
 in their children so completely they don&#39;t use any kind of punishment<br/>
or coercion to navigate each day.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll also read about teens that ADORE their parents, love to hang<br/>
out with them and don&#39;t have any symptoms of teen rebellion.:)  I wish<br/>
you could have met all the older kids at the Live and Learn<br/>
conference...they&#39;re amazing.<br/>
<br/>
I was up until 1am in the lobby with a group of them one night and<br/>
said something about getting tired. They all chimed in &quot;You CAN&#39;T go<br/>
to sleep, we&#39;re having too much fun!!&quot;<br/>
Go figure.<br/>
They WANTED an adult to hang out with them...you don&#39;t get that kind<br/>
of attitude unless you trust and treat children with the same respect<br/>
you&#39;d give any other human being. It works.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why you&#39;ll hear about it over and over and over again here. It<br/>
works better for unschooling if the parenting issues are examined. To<br/>
me, the crux of unschooling is mindful, respectful<br/>
parenting....learning is a secondary and natural side effect in a<br/>
household where the children are totally respected.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203735501">*I had one woman<br/>
who uses the classical approach tell me she unschools in the afternoons<br/>
after her boys finish their work for the day. I just let that one<br/>
go ;).*<br/>
<br/>
When my sister, Ren, was visiting Alaska, a couple years ago, I <br/>
brought her and the kids along to a Halloween party for a bunch of <br/>
relaxed homeschoolers and a few unschoolers.  One of the ladies there <br/>
asked us a few questions about the fact that we unschool, she said &quot;We <br/>
do both relaxed homeschool and unschooling.&quot;  Both Ren and I, in <br/>
unison, start laughing and say, &quot;YOU CAN&#39;T DO BOTH!&quot;.  I think we <br/>
shocked her!  I ran into her here a few  months ago and she asked me <br/>
if I still unschooled and then went on to say that she tried it, she <br/>
would try and write down everything that she thought her daughter, <br/>
Carlie, was learning and ,apparently, it didn&#39;t look like she was <br/>
learning enough so she went back to relaxed homeschooling.  People <br/>
just don&#39;t get it!!  Not only that, but a few days later I ran into <br/>
Carlie, in the hall of the dance studio (her mom teaches gymnastics), <br/>
and asked her why she wasn&#39;t participating that day, she says &quot;Oh, I <br/>
didn&#39;t get my school work done, you know how it goes, privileges, <br/>
privileges, privileges.&quot;  I wanted to puke!!!  I don&#39;t even call that <br/>
relaxed homeschooling!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704569206">i agree.  now that i&#39;m an adult by years anyway, i have found my voice <br/>
and, like many compliant, shy types, am ticked off!  at 41 i&#39;m finlly <br/>
beginning to find some level of confidence that allows the calmer side <br/>
of me to shine without losing my voice.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; never considers her children, it is just that she rarely *has* to.*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does she ever ask her kids &quot;Would you like to do these math <br/>
&gt; worksheets?&quot;  The problem I see with this is that just because kids <br/>
&gt; are &quot;compliant&quot; doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t seething with resentment <br/>
&gt; inside.  My little sister was extremely compliant and seemingly had <br/>
&gt; the least amount of resentments during our childhood, but now she <br/>
&gt; has found her voice and she is ANGRY at many things.  She complied <br/>
&gt; but she was not happy about complying; she just couldn&#39;t find her <br/>
&gt; voice to express that. <br/>
