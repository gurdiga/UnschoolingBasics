I try  <br/>
really hard to help them navigate their  worlds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted before but have been unschooling and reading several  <br/>
unschooling lists for a long time now. I have unlearned a lot in regards to  <br/>
parenting and being with my son who is 7.  So I kind of know what not to do  now but <br/>
am having a hard time knowing what to do!  I am specifically  talking about <br/>
helping him in social situations.  I myself am clueless  socially and so I don&#39;t <br/>
know how to guide him. He and I are both shy and  take a while to warm up. <br/>
There are no kids in our neighborhood and so we  make every effort to get <br/>
together whenever we can with our local homeschool  group and sports, etc. He LOVES <br/>
being with the kids. But at the Park Days, he  kind of follows the group of <br/>
kids around and  stands on the perimeter and  watches. Eventually, he finds his <br/>
way in and plays and has a great time but  I have a feeling that if he knew <br/>
how to jump in sooner, he would.  I am  embarrassed to say it but I don&#39;t know <br/>
what to tell him because I don&#39;t know how  to do it either.  I always wait for <br/>
someone to invite me in. So I suppose  my question is twofold - what are some <br/>
specific ideas I can give him for meeting  people and where do I learn those <br/>
kind of skills in order to give him those  tools?   Reading the discussion <br/>
about teaching your kids HOW to work  things out really struck a chord with me - I <br/>
wasn&#39;t ever taught and I am still  40 years later trying to &quot;get&quot; it but I am <br/>
worried that I never will and I don&#39;t  want my son to struggle with the same <br/>
relational stuff. Help?<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

not one that&#39;s valued very often. I think of this as &quot;social-<br/>

also making note of who&#39;s nice, who&#39;s mean, who likes to play with <br/>
little kids and who prefers to hang out with big&#39;uns and figuring <br/>

that - its an internal process. <br/>

My dd is very much like this, and so am I. Once I realized that this <br/>

more confidence in my own ability to observe - and I&#39;ve started to <br/>
feel good about what I&#39;m doing, rather than decrying what I&#39;m not <br/>
suited to do. I&#39;m not &quot;holding back&quot; - I&#39;m looking before I leap. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-489017413">It is so nice to hear someone say something that is not negative about being<br/>
*shy*. My daughter is what some would call painfully shy, but so am I and<br/>
her father. I am so tired of it being seen as a character flaw in her. It<br/>
seemed at school they wanted me to believe she was struggling and having a<br/>
hard time and to work with her at home everyday learning sight words,<br/>
learning letters not in abc order etc. But the truth is she would not tell<br/>
them orally not written or point to, she doesn&#39;t talk much unless she feels<br/>
comfortable with you. I love this about her, she&#39;s not going to walk off<br/>
with anyone but me if we are somewhere, my oldest dd loved everyone, I used<br/>
to worry about her walking off with someone, never did. But I realized they<br/>
were making her feel bad for not talking, getting walked in by me every<br/>
morning, they hated that but I said to bad. SHe is home now though and<br/>
loving it. We are all kind of homebodies, all our family think we&#39;re wierd.<br/>
Oh well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381449580">In _The Highly Sensitive Child_, Elaine Aron describes that some people <br/>
have a strong &quot;pause to check&quot; system and others have a <br/>
strong &quot;behavioral activation&quot; or &quot;go for it&quot; system.  And there are <br/>
many people in between, of course.  She uses an example of the two <br/>
types of deer in a herd increasing the odds that the herd will <br/>
survive.  The &quot;pause to check&quot; deer would look out for predators before <br/>
entering a meadow.  The &quot;go for it&quot; deer would jump in to eat the green <br/>
grass.  Both systems have benefits, and neither is wrong.</div>

<br/>
hello there, Just a thought here, if he is happy to watch on the<br/>
perimeter before jumping in to play that may be just his way of<br/>
being.If you are shy it doesn&#39;t mean you are clueless<br/>
socially.Sometimes shy people get treated badly in school(I am<br/>
guessing most of us have had a schooled experience) and get pushed to<br/>
be other than they are( I am thinking of my sister,I am very outgoing<br/>
and she used to be quietly sucking her thumb and not speaking) Shy<br/>
doesn&#39;t always mean lacking confidence,taking a while to warm up is<br/>
not a bad thing!! Have you read Raising Your Spirited Child? There is<br/>
a lot about introvert and extrovert people and how to recognize and<br/>
respect each others ways of being, Moms and kids.<br/>
