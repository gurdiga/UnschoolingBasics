<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486737732">Hi everyone,<br/>
 I have an issue that has kept me wondering for some<br/>
time, but I am not sure what to do about it. I have a<br/>
now 29 mo. old son who is not saying much at this<br/>
time. He does try and he does make up his own words<br/>
for things. He is quick with signs and will also make<br/>
up his own signs once I have run out. <br/>
his doctor said that I should go and ask for early<br/>
intervention and some program called &#39;ladders&#39;. Now I<br/>
am wodering what they are and what  they could<br/>
possibly do to help him that I am not already doing.<br/>
We are a bilingual household (I speak German to him,<br/>
my husband English). He has a few words in German, a<br/>
few in English. Being unschoolers we spend the days<br/>
together: reading books, playing, talking etc, etc.<br/>
Others have remarked how he does not seem like a<br/>
little kid, he likes to play with the big boys in our<br/>
homeschooling group, dressing up as a knight and<br/>
putting on swordfights, he  can follow and join in a<br/>
simple boardgame, he can but together and play with te<br/>
little lego pieces, he loves any kind of movement and<br/>
is not developmentally behind on those levels. I know<br/>
he understands everything and he can make himself<br/>
understood to me and his brother and father. He hakes<br/>
up words or signs for  things he does not know how to<br/>
say (example: Ah! = Knight, UUah = Dragon, Blob =<br/>
Water, a million variations on the word and<br/>
pronunciation of the word baby, which could mean<br/>
anything from I want to do this by myself, to I want<br/>
to walk, to can I have this etc.). <br/>
When he watches Dora he will shout out backpack<br/>
(babab) or map etc.<br/>
Recently he is trying to form more words, for schlafen<br/>
he will just say ffff. <br/>
Overall he is a very happy, curious, loving, open<br/>
child who can follow long movies with rapt attention<br/>
and his own comments. He just is not a &#39;talker&#39;. I see<br/>
that he has some trouble acctually forming the words,<br/>
but if you were to lets say sit down and try to have<br/>
him repeat certain sound or words and correct him he<br/>
does not like that. I do not want to make him feel<br/>
that he is deficient in any way - is that not what<br/>
those people would do? Look at him to see what was<br/>
wrong with him? Or could they really offer something<br/>
that I could not give him?<br/>
Anyone advice is appreciated.<br/>
Love to you all,<br/>

We lived in Germany when Cameron was born. He was a late talker too. <br/>
Our home was bilingual as well. When Ben was home, we spoke English. <br/>
When Cameron and I were alone, it was mostly German---and of course all <br/>
the neighbors and shopkeepers spoke German to him.<br/>
<br/>
He understood *everything* but didn&#39;t speak. He&#39;d smile. And nod. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then the words he DID choose to say first were the same in both <br/>
languages: ball, auto, hand, glass, shoe. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So I think it was just a LOT to digest. He found it easiest to work <br/>
with what he KNEW. He&#39;s always been like that though---he&#39;d concentrate <br/>
for a really long time on something---and it would seem (to me) as if <br/>
he&#39;d never get it. Then ploetzlich &lt;g&gt; he&#39;d HAVE it. And WELL.<br/>
<br/>
As long as you know that his hearing is OK, I&#39;d just keep doing what <br/>
you&#39;re doing. Maybe examine the words he DOES say well---are they the <br/>
same in both languages?<br/>

and many kids, especially boys are not talking at that<br/>
age. If you&#39;re concerned get his hearing tested. But<br/>
it sounds like he has no problem understanding<br/>
language.<br/>
<br/>
My son was a late talker. He was in early intervention<br/>
because he was developmentally behind in many ways.<br/>
Early intervention ends when the kid turns 3. The EI<br/>
folks wanted us to put him in the school system for<br/>
speech therapy. I was more worried about the messages<br/>
he might get about being &quot;not good enough&quot;. We decided<br/>
to give it time and his speech caught up by and by.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-66032080">I&#39;ve known bilingual children who were precocious talkers, but I think it&#39;s supposed to be more common for them to take longer initially to sort it all out.<br/>
<br/>
You could always meet with and talk to the speech therapist or whomever your doctor recommends by yourself (without ds) and find out what they&#39;d do and what they&#39;d recommend.  Then at least you&#39;d have that information to use in making a decision as to what you want to do with your son (nothing different, therapy, or modify some of your own interactions).  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest had some speech delays.  When he was about 8, I guess, we did have him evaluated.  Our insurance would pay for the testing, but not therapy!  At that point he was old enough for me to explain to him, &quot;There are some sounds that are hard for you to say, but it also makes it hard for other people to understand you sometimes,&quot; and then he was willing for me to help him practice those sounds (mostly /th/) when they came up in normal conversation.  Didn&#39;t take long for him to get it.  According to the testing he also had some language delays, but I don&#39;t think those effect his everyday communication.  Besides, I had some issues with their validity.  For example, they asked him what &quot;to obey&quot; meant.  When they told me this, my first thought was, &quot;Well, we never use that word (unless it comes up in a book or something) so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good example for our family.&quot;  Then they told me his response:  to do what someone tells you to.  So then I was left wondering<br/>
 what on earth was wrong with that anyway?  I never asked.  (Too overwhelmed.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106741513">Mara, there is a book entitled Late Talking Children by Thomas Sowell which may<br/>
help you sort out your concerns. Ive copied a review of it below. Hope this helps.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From Kirkus Reviews<br/>
 A father&#39;s first-person account of his<br/>
young son&#39;s difficulties in learning to talk, his surprising disoveries<br/>
about other late talkers, and some intriguing speculation about the<br/>
causes of this problem. Although clearly a bright boy who understood<br/>
when spoken to and who displayed unusual analytical abilities (as a<br/>
toddler, he managed to outwit a child-proof lock), Sowell&#39;s son John<br/>
did not speak until he was almost four years old. When Sowell, a Hoover<br/>
Institute senior fellow (Migrations and Culture, 1996, etc.), wrote<br/>
about his son in his syndicated newspaper column, dozens of parents of<br/>
late-talking children wrote to him. A support group of 55 families<br/>
representing 57 children eventually formed. Sowell follows the story of<br/>
his son John--now a successful computer scientist-- with numerous<br/>
anecdotal accounts from these families&#39; letters. Seeing a pattern in<br/>
their stories, Sowell sent out questionnaires in 1994 and 1996, and the<br/>
results of the longer 1996 survey are summarized here. He discovered<br/>
that most of the late talkers were boys, with especially good memories<br/>
and puzzle-solving skills, that most were slow in their social<br/>
development and late in toilet training, and that many had close<br/>
relatives who played musical instruments or were in analytical<br/>
professions. Sowell, who is more anecdotal than scientific in his<br/>
approach, is quick to acknowledge that his is a biased sample of late<br/>
talkers, but he asserts that both professionals and parents should be<br/>
aware of this pattern of mental abilities and family backgrounds. It<br/>
may be, he speculates, that some bright children are late in talking<br/>
precisely because the demands of their analytical abilities, localized<br/>
in the left half of the brain, are being met at the expense of the<br/>
speech function. Children like his son, he warns, are frequently<br/>
misdiagnosed as retarded or autistic and thus risk being placed in<br/>
special- education classes, from which release may be difficult. Hardly<br/>
definitive, but should ease the minds of worried parents. -- Copyright ©1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.<br/>

to speech therapy however what she did wasn&#39;t anything i couldn&#39;t do<br/>
with him. I read that speech delayed children start talking when they<br/>
are 5 or 6 like everyone else. It didn&#39;t help me not to worry but like<br/>
everything else it worked out on it&#39;s own..kwim? We used signs. For a<br/>
long time he would just make sounds, i&#39;m sure you know,lol. I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
worry if i were you. My son talks all the time now :)-- In<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-674063561">Hi Mara!  My 23mo old doesn&#39;t speak much either.  And the words she<br/>
does use are quite hard to understand - more so than the others were<br/>
at this age.  Like your son, she understands *everything* said to her<br/>
so I&#39;m not concerned with her mental status.  If I really work with<br/>
her to get her to say a word correctly, she can do that as well.  And<br/>
I have tested her with whispers many times (and of course the<br/>
pediatrician&#39;s tests) to make sure it&#39;s not a hearing issue and she<br/>
can hear just great.  She also uses some signs.  I personally think my<br/>
DD is just going at her own pace.  She does other things that are<br/>
&#39;advanced&#39; (though I hate that word) for her age.  Such as, if I tell<br/>
her to put something down, she has to go put it back right where she<br/>
found it.  It&#39;s almost eerie as my other kids haven&#39;t done that at<br/>
that age at all.  lol  So my theory is that she&#39;s just focusing on<br/>
other things right now and she&#39;ll focus on speech when she gets to it.<br/>
<br/>
I recently heard a speech from a dentist that said sippy cups are<br/>
basically evil when it comes to speech (his wife is a speech<br/>
therapist) and he suggested getting them on straw cups and regular<br/>
cups as soon as possible because they&#39;ve seen them have effects on<br/>
teeth and speech in some kids.  Also to not let them wander around<br/>
with sippies all day - drinks in the kitchen or wherever you deem<br/>
appropriate.  He said the sucking on the no-spill sippies forces<br/>
everything in the jaw forward and they should get off of them asap for<br/>
dental reasons.  Just something I thought I&#39;d pass along...take it or<br/>
leave it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, my brother didn&#39;t speak a word of English until he was 3 years<br/>
old (except yes meant &#39;no&#39; and no meant &#39;yes&#39;, which drove my<br/>
grandfather crazy.  LOL).  He had his own language - our mother even<br/>
had a list of 30-40 words (and their counterparts) written down at one<br/>
point.  Narnu was &#39;horse&#39;, etc.  Oddly (lol), the day I came home from<br/>
the hospital, he started speaking english like everyone else.  lol  He<br/>
is now a very accomplished speaker and writer and does movie reviews<br/>
and works for CalTech.  My mother would interpret for him all the time<br/>
when he had his own language.  He&#39;s always been very creative and is<br/>
talented in drawing, sculpting, computer graphics and writing.  Most<br/>
of the time now, his writing is waaaaaay over my head.  lol<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to do the speech program your dr is recommending...and<br/>
it is involved with the school system, be sure to check it out<br/>
thoroughly.  Some districts have full-time enrollment requirements<br/>
associated with speech class.  You might look around for someone in<br/>
your social groups who has worked with speech issues before.  Another<br/>
mom in my MOPS group is an ex-speech therapist and has given out lots<br/>
of advice and help.  So it might be good to look around if you&#39;re<br/>
thinking of doing some kind of program.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s just your DSs creativity showing early or with you and DH<br/>
speaking two different languages, he feels he wants HIS own language<br/>
too.  ;) <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-739316594">I wanted to chime in with another validation of this experience. <br/>
Neither of my brothers spoke a word until they were three, and one is <br/>
headed to college next year, the other is 14 and perfectly fine with <br/>
speech now, though he had really difficult speech until he was 6 or <br/>
so. My first son also wasn&#39;t very verbal until around three, and has <br/>
a very large vocabularly and &quot;good speech&quot; whatever that means at age <br/>
4. He had a stutter for a long while that is 98% gone, he had several <br/>
classic developmental mispronunciations that were pathologized by <br/>
well meaning speech people at parent events we went to, and 98% of <br/>
those are gone. My ped in NY wanted us to have all kinds of evals <br/>
done, but it never happened.<br/>
MY ped here in PA could care less, and thinks people make a huge deal <br/>
out of speech issues. He has been in practice for 30 years and can&#39;t <br/>
understand why people react like they do. My second child just had <br/>
his two year check up, doesn&#39;t say any words really, and it wasn&#39;t <br/>
perceived as a problem. This doesn&#39;t tell you anything about your <br/>
specific child I realize, but it might help put speech theories into <br/>
perspective.<br/>
In the last ten years, I have seen a huge increase in referrals for <br/>
kids to various therapists. While its great for kids with problems, I <br/>
feel like 1 out of 3 kids we know is getting some kind of <br/>
intervention for a &quot;problem&quot; my own kid or one of my brothers has <br/>
had, and as far as I can tell they are all progressing roughly the <br/>
same with or without intervention. So I have gotten really skeptical <br/>
about this stuff.<br/>

&gt; does use are quite hard to understand - more so than the others were<br/>
