<div id="ygrps-yiv-186539208">hiya, (excuse crosspost)<br/>
<br/>
ive just reviewed an advance digital copy of The Unschooling  <br/>
Unmanual, which will be published early feb.<br/>
<br/>
It is a collection of 11 essays from the likes of John Holt, Rue  <br/>
Kream, Jan Hunt & others, coedited by Jan Hunt (from the Natural  <br/>
Child Project) and her unschooled son Jason.<br/>
<br/>
im posting the review now because the book is available at a  <br/>
discounted rate of 25% off up until Feb 5.<br/>
<br/>
the book is broad but particularly will leave you with enormous trust  <br/>
and understanding of natural learning. Although inherent to some  <br/>
essays, the book does not really delve into non coercive parenting  <br/>
issues relating to radical unschooling in much detail.<br/>
<br/>
I do not mention this as a criticism, just a description. I actually  <br/>
found the emphasis quite useful given the context of other  <br/>
unschooling books out there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway if this interests you, find out more:<br/>
