<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475665791">I also have an unschooling friend whose daughter was having problems as a<br/>
toddler.  Once at the doctor&#39;s they were taking blood from her dd, and the<br/>
nurse asked if she wanted to test for allergies while doing the blood work.<br/>
Turns out dd was allergic to wheat, soy, egg, and a list of other things.<br/>
Once they eliminated these things from her diet she said is was like a whole<br/>
new child.  Definitely worth looking in to.<br/>
