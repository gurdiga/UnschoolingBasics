wanting and feeling that we need all this stuff that we don&#39;t need.<br/>
**********************<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I&#39;ve found most helpful in this regard has been to <br/>
reframe the concept of &quot;anti-consumerism&quot; in a more positive form. <br/>
Coneptually, this is related to the unschooling concept of &quot;living <br/>
by principles&quot; so here&#39;s a link to a sort of &quot;primer&quot; on that <br/>
concept:<br/>

<br/>
From an unschooling standpoint, the question isn&#39;t so much &quot;how do I <br/>
talk about consumerism (so my kids understand its wrong)&quot; its more a <br/>
matter of &quot;how do I promote a sense of abundance and fulfillment <br/>
within my family?&quot;<br/>
**********************<br/>
 When she forgets about tv for a few weeks she<br/>
really doesn&#39;t think about more stuff.... But the cycle starts all <br/>
over again if we have a<br/>
rainy week and the tv is on a lot.<br/>
***********************<br/>
<br/>
It might be useful to think about why she may be watching more tv <br/>
sometimes and how those other factors may *also* be contributing to <br/>
a sense of lack or dissatisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
A child stuck inside during a spate of bad weather (to use the above <br/>
example) may not be as happy as she is at other times. From one <br/>
perspective, her options are limited, so she&#39;s seeking to expand <br/>
them. What she sees on tv is providing her with possibilites.<br/>
<br/>
As a parent, then, it may be worth look into having other options <br/>
available for those sorts of situations. Build a collection of <br/>
projects and supplies and games to spark some excitement on a dull <br/>
day, or those times when everyone in the family seems to be in a <br/>
rut. Y&#39;all know about &quot;strewing&quot; don&#39;t you? <br/>

<br/>
Its also worth considering what mom&#39;s doing when the tv is on, <br/>
especially if its on longer than usual. This isn&#39;t meant to be <br/>
accusatory, but as someone (I suspect Paul) commented, tv *can* make <br/>
it easier to wander off and do our own thing...pay bills, clean the <br/>
fridge, surf the net ;) Things that aren&#39;t always terribly appealing <br/>
to the our kids. Personally, whenever it seems as though Mo has been <br/>
watching more tv than usual, I do a little self-check to see if I&#39;m <br/>
contributing by being...well, boring! If I&#39;m not &quot;filling Mo&#39;s cup&quot; <br/>
as it were, she&#39;s going to look somewhere else for fulfillment. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another thought - reframing the questions we ask ourselves <br/>
helps shift the focus of our attention. If the question is about <br/>
consumerism, I&#39;m thinking about the world at large, pollution, <br/>
politics, global warming, etc. If the question is about abundance <br/>
within my family, I&#39;m thinking about what *I* can do to help the <br/>
people I love get more out of life Right Now. That&#39;s not to say <br/>
thinking about changing the world is somehow wrongheaded, but it <br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily improve my relationship with my kid Today. <br/>
