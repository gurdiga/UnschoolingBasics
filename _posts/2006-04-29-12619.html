<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114270325">Hello!  My name is Jody and I just joined this loop last week and <br/>
Wow does it really give me cause to look at my children with <br/>
different eyes!  I have 4 children ranging in ages from 11 to <br/>
15mos.  We have been learning at home now for 4 years (my 2 older <br/>
children did time in PS before I realized what I was doing!!)  <br/>
However, before my baby was born, I attempted to do *school* at <br/>
home!!  Until, one day I couldn&#39;t figure out what exactly a <br/>
predicate nominative was or exactly why someone would need to <br/>
know??  Then my baby was born and, well the rest is history (I <br/>
couldn&#39;t get her stay on my school schedule ;-) <br/>
<br/>
So now we are unschoolers, always have been at heart, just afraid to <br/>
follow my heart.  And still have days wondering what exactly is <br/>
going on here.  I just feel so busy with regular ordinary things: <br/>
helping the two smaller children get dressed, nursing the baby and <br/>
feeding the rest, washing dishes, washing clothes, that sometimes I <br/>
don&#39;t feel like I have spent enough quality time with them. Some <br/>
days we don&#39;t even manage to read together and they resist reading <br/>
alone.  We live with my in-laws and my MIL refuses to let the <br/>
children do anything in the kitchen and does not really like for <br/>
them to have any paints or playdough or anything that will *ruin* <br/>
the carpet (I spend a lot of time picking up after them in order to <br/>
keep the peace).  But we take many field trips and go to the park <br/>
every week and they play on the computer and watch t.v., but most of <br/>
all they just like to pretend play.  Lately, though, I&#39;ve been <br/>
hearing &quot;I&#39;m bored, there is nothing to do!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So I have really enjoyed reading the past week and am getting a <br/>
sense that any reservations I am having really have to do with me <br/>
and my hang-ups or false ideas. Thanks for the suggested reading <br/>
list and thanks for taking your time to help me stay focused and <br/>
continue to gain clarity about what I REALLY want for my <br/>
children....a happiness and a joy for LIFE!!<br/>
<br/>

where my children were not invited into the kitchen!!  Is this a temporary<br/>
arrangement?  Have you appealed to her &quot;schooly&quot; side in that the children<br/>
need to be in the kitchen so they can learn measurements, fractions and, uh,<br/>
science, yeah, that&#39;s the ticket ;)<br/>
