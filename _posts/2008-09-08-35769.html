<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090463155">To the woman whose son wants to work on a crab fishing boat......I&#39;d suggest he interview a few people about the job. I knew a guy who did that for awhile in order to earn money to become a commercial airline pilot. The &quot;deadliest catch&quot;  show is probably the finest in the industry. I am not trying to discourage it, but its incredibly dangerous and there are some unscrupulous outfits up there, who hire people under the table with checkered pasts. So just be careful. I also knew lots of people who worked in the cannaries, which is also very demanding and unglamorous, but its an &quot;in&quot; to the industry and he could learn what boats are better to work on than others. <br/>
<br/>
Another option just to get up in Alaska and find his way around would be to work in the National Parks or Resorts while he gets a feel for things. They provide company housing and meals and its a good way to get acclimated to Alaska and make some money in the meanwhile.  I did that for three seasons May-Sept. (before kids) <br/>
