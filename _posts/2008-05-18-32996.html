<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083079220">Saturday the boys and I went to another park and after garrett&#39;s<br/>
dad picked him up -- Ian and I spent some more time playing. But when<br/>
a little boy showed up that was quite disfigured in the face Ian<br/>
didn&#39;t want to stay much longer. I was also a little sad how Ian<br/>
responded. I really feel that it is not good to put our expectations<br/>
on him and I didn&#39;t push anything. This is how it went. when Ian<br/>
finally saw the boy first he started staring. Which I wanted to too<br/>
but I know ... so I just whispered in Ians ears that sometimes people<br/>
don&#39;t always look the same but it was ok and he was just like him<br/>
(something like that?). but when the boy was near Ian kind of made the<br/>
comment to me that he didn&#39;t want to play with someone like that????<br/>
at one point I even had a opportunity to help the dad get the little<br/>
boy down from something (I was afraid he might fall -- but like most<br/>
little guys he was just fine) so I showed Ian that it was ok --- I<br/>
didn&#39;t plan that it just happened and later I realized that just maybe<br/>
Ian saw that I was worried, or scared of the little guy so maybe.???<br/>
Anyway when we left I tried to explain some more about sometimes<br/>
people are born or have accidents that do this .....What do we do in<br/>
these situations???? I can&#39;t make Ian play with him and I&#39;m sure the<br/>
little boy did look scary or weird to Ian.<br/>
I just felt sad. I can only imagine how the dad feels -- he has to<br/>
get that -- people staring, little kids not playing with him.. He<br/>
brought him at a time when there was no one -- just us -- Gosh<br/>
sometimes this world is tough.</div>

Look at it from his point of view. What would help you if you saw  <br/>
something frightening? Would explanations that it was normal help?  <br/>
Basically what you&#39;re saying is that scary things exist.<br/>
<br/>
How about reading some books about kids with differences? Have a  <br/>
conversation about how you think it must be to be like that, that it  <br/>
would make you sad if people laughed at you. If he gives some  <br/>
responses that sound hurtful, like &quot;I&#39;d run up and punch him.&quot; try  <br/>
not to get angry with him!  It&#39;s an honest reaction to feeling  <br/>
powerless and scared. But give him feedback on how you&#39;d feel if you  <br/>
were the little boy who&#39;d been punched.<br/>
<br/>
One of the tricky things is that more goes into kids than we think.  <br/>
So even if their reactions to what you&#39;re saying aren&#39;t lining up  <br/>
with what you&#39;d expect, the information is getting processed.<br/>
