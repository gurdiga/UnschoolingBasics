&gt; <br/>
&gt; ****I don&#39;t think fat is such a bad thing IF it (and mostly everything else <br/>
&gt; you eat) comes to you as it was intended = Whole/complete and organic = Not <br/>
&gt; processed in any way by man. That&#39;s a hard thing to accomplish in this day and <br/>
&gt; age, definitely takes more time on our parts. Too bad, man just can&#39;t seem <br/>
&gt; to help himself when it comes to our food sources, just can&#39;t leave well <br/>
&gt; enough alone. The things they do to our dairy and meat products are enough to kill <br/>
&gt; us all, or at least the ones we will leave behind.<br/>
