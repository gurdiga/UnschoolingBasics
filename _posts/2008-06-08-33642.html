<div id="ygrps-yiv-968661253">If this is too OT I apologize but I am trying everything I can think of to<br/>
get help.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone here have experience with defending against false accusations of<br/>
physical misconduct nature? Someone in my family (who is 100% behind us in<br/>
unschooling!) has been accused by someone else in my family. I 100% believe<br/>
the accusations to be false as far as this person is concerned but don&#39;t<br/>
really know where to turn to get help for the person accused who is somewhat<br/>
vulnerable. The family in question lives in Maine if anyone has any state<br/>
specific information that could be of help. I am in NJ and having a hard<br/>
time locating resources that might be helpful. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
(yes the person accused is in the process of finding legal counsel. any<br/>
ideas on determining qualified/not qualified on the part of the attorney<br/>
would be helpful as well)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows of any information on exposing false allegations that would<br/>
be helpful too!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
