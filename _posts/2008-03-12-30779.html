Brad,<br/>
<br/>
You called my daughter (Morgan the 3.5 yr old) a red-zone case.  She<br/>
is NOT outside the established limits of what society considers<br/>
acceptable.  She&#39;s delayed perhaps in her speech, but she isn&#39;t<br/>
violent, destructive, nor dangerous.  &quot;Red-zone&quot; in typical parlance =<br/>
dangerous and Morgan is NOT dangerous.  She&#39;s remarkably normal<br/>
especially considering all she&#39;s been through and all she&#39;s missed.<br/>
If you met her, you&#39;d think she was just a shy child.  Until you spent<br/>
time with her you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell she&#39;s delayed.  And her<br/>
&quot;purpose&quot; in life is to be happy and the only thing she needs to learn<br/>
right now is that we love her and will meet her needs.<br/>
<br/>
And you keep calling yourself a nihlist and since you are here I<br/>
assume you are a parent.  So I&#39;m confused.  I will assume you are an<br/>
athiest, so ascribe no higher purpose to life (which I understand<br/>
BTW), that you believe there is no true morality anywhere, and that<br/>
because objective secular beliefs are impossible (which I also<br/>
understand) that life has no meaning and all actions are equally<br/>
valid.  If that&#39;s true, what does that look like in your home?  And is<br/>
this why you called my daughter a Red zone?  Would your kids be<br/>
considered a red zone?  (I&#39;m trying to figure out if it was a<br/>
derogatory comment...indicating something I need to fix or not.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m befuddled by your posts, and I surmise that the conflict between<br/>
your writing and my reading is your belief that nothing at all<br/>
matters, if nothing matters, then it&#39;s hard to offer direction and<br/>
maybe that&#39;s why I am confused by your writings.  Would you mind<br/>
enlighting me on these points?  I&#39;d like to get what you are offering<br/>
in your posts but I&#39;m going to need some point of reference for you,<br/>
and since Nihlism essentially says &quot;anything goes&quot; your nihilsm may<br/>
vary from what my view of it is and I am trying to be more sensitive<br/>
to where others are coming from.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Karen<br/>

Karen I&#39;ve got the reddest cheeks one could ever have from <br/>
embarrassment right now. I just realized that somewhere in  the last <br/>
couple of days I have mixed this thread up with the one about the <br/>
teenage girl who destroys her parents items when she is angry, I <br/>
don&#39;t know how it happened, but I assure you that I am in no way <br/>
referring to your daughter as a red-zone case. In fact, even tho I am <br/>
nihilist I am extremely humbled by you and your case and hold you in <br/>
the highest regards for what you are doing. I so profusely apologise <br/>
for getting this thread mixed up with that other one. Please Please <br/>
Please forgive me. <br/>

<br/>
I do not consider myself an atheist since they assert an absolute <br/>
that there is no higher being, I shy away from absolutes and take the <br/>
skeptic stance of nihilism which is to recognise there is no evidence <br/>
for a higher power, but I leave the door open. Most nihilists <br/>
wouldn&#39;t agree with my stance since most of them take a political <br/>
stance against certain things. I believe that a true nihilist can <br/>
hold no political position on anything without recognising he is just <br/>
entertaining himself if he does. As far as what it looks like in my <br/>
home, My wife would probably take pascal&#39;s wager just to be safe and <br/>
I leave it up to my children to believe however they like, but I do <br/>
not censor them to my beliefs.<br/>
Again, please believe me, I hold you in very high regards and do not <br/>
consider your precious daughter a red-zone....and by the way, red-<br/>
zone is not a derogatory label, it is simply a label.<br/>

explanation I can offer as to why I would be here is because I find <br/>
all this unschooling fascinating. I find most of you fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
I sincerely apologize to everyone in this group for getting mixed up <br/>
like I did...</div>
