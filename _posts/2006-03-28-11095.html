<div id="ygrps-yiv-299853205">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m new, with a gifted almost 13yo dd who wants to start at the local <br/>
communtiy college this summer. We live in CA and this college has <br/>
a &quot;Special Admit&quot; program for young kids. She doesn&#39;t have to be 14 or <br/>
have a GED or take the ACT/SAT. I just need to prepare a transcript to <br/>
reflect her &quot;high school&quot; record. Anyone know any links to help me <br/>
out? I&#39;ve looked quite a bit. Right now I&#39;m thinking of modifying the <br/>
Mary Balwin college high school transcript. I hate to re-invent the <br/>
wheel, though. Surely someone out there has done this! I did find a <br/>
book that my library doesn&#39;t have that I might order. Any help would <br/>
be appreciated!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070108177">My mom used to work in the admissions department of a university.  She suggested to me to call the school and tell them how your daughter was educated, that she doesn&#39;t have a traditional transcript and to arrange an interview, perhaps bringing a portfolio.<br/>
