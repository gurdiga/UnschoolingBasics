<div id="ygrps-yiv-30131030">Hi Everyone~ <br/>
This is my first post (I believe) on this list. I was reading <br/>
through some old post and I started to think...I would love to know <br/>
from the people who have been doing this for a long time...if I&#39;m <br/>
doing it right. Unschooling that is. I know this is a <br/>
very &quot;schoolish&quot; question, but I am over educated and just now <br/>
learning about the really important things. How to love and give and <br/>
accept...how not to judge. I thought what if I wrote out what our <br/>
average day/week/life looks like and see what kind of responses I <br/>
get. SOOO here I go.<br/>
Oh, by the way I have 2 kids. A DD 9 and a DS 7, who have been out <br/>
of school for almost 2 years. We are all still deschooling our minds.<br/>
This is what we do...<br/>
sew,paint,knit,bead,cook,plant and harvest vegtables and fruit,play <br/>
videogames, I read vidoegame stuff to 7 year old who still thinks he <br/>
can&#39;t read, we read together,DD reads to DS, DD reads,reads and <br/>
reads. All kinds of stuff from fiction to non fiction, science stuff <br/>
and experiments, magazines. We look at things under the microscope <br/>
we have tried to cross pollenate flowers, we make all kinds of huge <br/>
messes with gooey science type stuff and alike. We play games <br/>
indoors and out, we run throught the sprinklers, do slip and slide <br/>
and have water balloon fights. We visit with neighbors, DD helps a <br/>
neighbor with her kids, we play guitar and piano. We listen to <br/>
music, make up silly stories, we lay in bed and laugh. We love one <br/>
another. DD runs track and is the SC state champ in shotput(as of <br/>
today!!) she also plays soccer and I have had a hard time with the <br/>
organized sports, but she loves it sooo I honor that. We take care <br/>
of our pets, a bird, a turtle and 2 guenie pigs (one just died) we <br/>
learn about life, death and god. We play with friends, go to the <br/>
movies and watch TV. We do dishes and laundry, we hardly ever make <br/>
our beds...hehehe! We bird watch, spider watch etc...We go out on <br/>
our boat and see all kinds of fun stuff like, <br/>
crabs,fish,jellyfish,dolphins,seagulls,pelicans and we play at the <br/>
beach. We dig holes at the beach, we make sandcastles, we boogie <br/>
board on the waves. We google everything!!! I could go on and on! <br/>
OK, well after typing ALL that without even having to think about <br/>
it...I think I&#39;m doing it &quot;right&quot;. <br/>
I am enjoying my family, we are learning together, loving together <br/>
and living together. WHAT A GREAT WAY OF LIFE! I&#39;m so glad I wrote <br/>
this it has given me all kinds of warm fuzzy feelings of gratitude!<br/>
Thanks so much for showing me this way of life and thanks for not <br/>
grading my grammer, because I was just typing...not thinking!<br/>
Hugs~ Tracy in SC</div>

<br/>
Clearly you lead a full and interesting life. However really only you can<br/>
answer whether you are Unschooling. I can suggest some ideas to think about,<br/>
since you were asking the question.<br/>
<br/>
This list of (fabulous) activities, taken alone, could easily apply to<br/>
someone schooling-at-home or using unit studies or being an eclectic<br/>
homeschooler, or even someone at school whose parents are really committed<br/>
to extra-curricular activities.<br/>
<br/>
The point of Unschooling is not the activities (which all sound absolutely<br/>
wonderful) but the how they are chosen and the why and the Trust behind<br/>
them. The point is the how the parents and children are interacting. These<br/>
are issues you could think about if you wanted another way to *describe*<br/>
your life to others in Unschooling terms, rather than only as a catalog of<br/>
how you spend your time (which is also very interesting, and useful to<br/>
people who might be wondering if our lives can be rich and full).<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling kids formulate their own goals, and engage in activities for<br/>
reasons of their own, rather than because some external person, such as Mom,<br/>
has some kind of educational *or* life lessons agenda. They generate their<br/>
own criteria for success.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling kids are free to stop doing anything that they have lost<br/>
interest in at any time, even if it has been fun in the past, without being<br/>
pressured by an external source to continue.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of the activities the family is undertaking, the parents Trust<br/>
that their children are getting something meaningful *to them* out of any<br/>
that they choose to pursue. Parents don&#39;t set arbitrary time limits, or<br/>
quiz, or check up that some milestone or goal has been reached.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling children have privacy of thought - they are not required to<br/>
report what they have learned, even if they could quantify it which seems<br/>
unlikely, and they are not required to share or publicize their writings or<br/>
art works - unless they choose to.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling families tend to handle conflict resolution without making one<br/>
person&#39;s needs subservient, or without reference to any judgment that one<br/>
person&#39;s desires are more worthy or educational than another&#39;s. Playing<br/>
video games is not considered more or less valuable than exploring through<br/>
the microscope.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling families tend to see all of their activities and pursuits as<br/>
interconnected and forming connections, as part of a greater concept of<br/>
understanding how the world works and out place in it.<br/>
<br/>
And this just touches on the Un*school*ing part, not the rest of the Whole<br/>
Life Unschooling - the other life issues like Bedtimes, Food, Chores,<br/>
Personal Hygiene.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am enjoying my family, we are learning together, loving together <br/>
and living together. WHAT A GREAT WAY OF LIFE!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is what sounds the most unschooly! I agree!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945533738">Hi, I guess I need to introduce myself first. I am a &#39;homeschooling&#39; mom of 3 <br/>
girls in Ohio, and am interested in unschooling. I was wondering how you <br/>
would use this &#39;method&#39; and file your notification and assessment for the school <br/>
district.<br/>
<br/>
When we filed before we were expected to provide the scope and sequence and a <br/>
list of materials to be used for the upcoming year, including their grade <br/>
level. The assessment was either a portfolio of their work from the year or <br/>
testing by the local school or an approved authority.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I&#39;m sort of confused at how to file this and stay within the law.<br/>
Thanks, Kanina <br/>

<br/>
In SC, we have to keep a portfolio. No one ever looks at it, but we <br/>
have to keep one! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t interfere with the boys or their learning at all. I collect <br/>
the brochures, ticket stubs, flyers, catalogues, library lists, <br/>
video/computer/board/card games played, movies watched, trips taken, <br/>
photos, artwork (or copies or photos of artwork), etc. and place them <br/>
in a large plastic bin (one for each child).  That&#39;s our portfolio.<br/>
<br/>
OH! I need to start two new ones this month!!<br/>
<br/>
I also write down what we do and with whom in a daytimer. If one of he <br/>
boys does something that would qualify as &quot;progress,&quot;<br/>
I&#39;ll write that down too.<br/>
<br/>
Every state is different. Which state are you in? Maybe someone here <br/>
can comment.<br/>

I am in Maryland and my children are the age to start high school.  I am under the impression that we will have to be keeping track of what looks like, at least, credit hours.  And that if the girls want to attend college, they will have to have those, and at least some textbooks listed in their transcripts that the college applications office recognizes (I have spoken to University of MD so far.)  Is it just more work on the parents&#39; part to make what the children do &quot;look&quot; like school?<br/>
<br/>
Our state requires two reviews a year--where portfolios are examined.  I belong to an Umbrella group, however, which only reviews me once a year.  <br/>
<br/>
Just looking for ideas on what unschoolers&#39; portfolios look like for presentation purposes and how unschoolers pull together transcripts for college.<br/>

help me understand. Am I on the right track with my thoughts? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little uncomfortable being asked to be an authoritative arbiter of<br/>
what is &quot;right&quot;. I&#39;m just one person here, and I happen to agree with all<br/>
you are saying ;) , but it is the gestalt - cumulative wisdom of the many on<br/>
this list and the sister lists - that is the most helpful - as well as the<br/>
advice to observe your children and allow *them* to tell you whether you are<br/>
on the right track.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Can you help me understand this more completely. For example the how <br/>
they are chosen part...we are living life, things are chosen (by my <br/>
kids) with interest or just because that is what is going on that <br/>
day. The sick geunie pig last week pretty much consumed 24hrs and we <br/>
learned alot from it. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The reply I made before was simply to point out that the activities are not<br/>
what makes anyone&#39;s life Unschooling. Posting to this list, &quot;We do this<br/>
stuff. Are we Unschooling?&quot; can only result in an answer along the lines of<br/>
&quot;It depends. Why are you doing this stuff?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Your description here sounds like Unschooling to me. Some hypothetical<br/>
person responding &quot;because it is a way for them to learn some subject&quot;<br/>
sounds a lot less like Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The Why...because it is the next logical thing to my kids. I feel <br/>
like I never have any idea whats next, I just go with the flow. I <br/>
flow down the stream with them only looking for dangerous rocks and <br/>
trying to help them when needed.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love this image. I would like to take it further with the idea that your<br/>
kids are also like the water itself - carving out the path of the stream -<br/>
not just following someone else&#39;s pre-made path.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Trust behind them... I am understanding this statement to mean that <br/>
I am trusting they are learning what they need to learn, not what I <br/>
think they need to learn. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is what I understand it to mean also - along with Trusting them to know<br/>
the *way* they wish to learn something as well as the *what*.<br/>

I thought the exchange on this point was great--how to get past doing <br/>
things for schooly reasons and get closer to living a joyful life. This <br/>
just came across a local homeschooling list, and I thought it <br/>
illustrated so succinctly this distinction Robyn is getting at:<br/>
<br/>
==For the past 8 yrs we have collected a number of Thomas the Tank <br/>
Engine and friendship style movies. We used them to teach the right and <br/>
wrong ways to approach the stepping stones friendship. Now that our last <br/>
is 8 he&#39;s willing to part with them. We have the following movies for <br/>
$1.50 each. ===<br/>
<br/>
I never in a million years would&#39;ve said that we watched Thomas in order <br/>
to teach anything or that we &quot;used&quot; the videos &quot;for&quot; anything other than <br/>
sheer enjoyment. Perhaps my kids did learn about the stepping stones to <br/>
friendship from watching the videos--they&#39;re certainly preachy <br/>
enough--but that was a total side effect of watching them because they <br/>
*liked* the stories. It just felt so sad to hear this woman selling her <br/>
kids video collection as part of their curriculum.<br/>

I had to smile at this and yes you are right it is sad they were part of a curriculum. My sons love Thomas and I would say the only obvious learning they got was numbers on the sides of the trains and that was never the reason for  them watching  Thomas. It never occurred to me.. For a long time my son used to call numbers by the train they represented.  It always made me smile when he said &quot;Its the number Percy&quot; e.t.c.  <br/>

I think it&#39;s rather sad that anything involving friendship was considered<br/>
something to be taught in a curriculum. How would it be graded? How sad if<br/>

When we filed before we were expected to provide the scope and sequence <br/>
and a<br/>
list of materials to be used for the upcoming year, including their <br/>
grade<br/>
level. The assessment was either a portfolio of their work from the <br/>
year or<br/>
testing by the local school or an approved authority.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for being off the lists for a while now. Too pretty <br/>
outside---and when I *am* on, I&#39;m working on the conference!<br/>
<br/>
There are two &quot;curricula&quot; for unschoolers. I use Carol Narigon&#39;s and <br/>
just alter it to fit my sons and our state requirements.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian also has a good generic one.<br/>
<br/>
I believe both are at Sandra&#39;s website----you could just google them. <br/>
OR someone with a better filing system (and a few more minutes) could <br/>
plop it here for you.<br/>
<br/>
As for the assessment, I&#39;d go with the portfolio rather than the <br/>
testing anytime!<br/>

I am in Maryland and my children are the age to start high school.  I <br/>
am under<br/>
the impression that we will have to be keeping track of what looks <br/>
like, at<br/>
least, credit hours.  And that if the girls want to attend college, <br/>
they will<br/>
have to have those, and at least some textbooks listed in their <br/>
transcripts that<br/>
the college applications office recognizes (I have spoken to University <br/>
of MD so<br/>
far.)  Is it just more work on the parents&#39; part to make what the <br/>
children do<br/>
&quot;look&quot; like school?<br/>
<br/>
Our state requires two reviews a year--where portfolios are examined.  <br/>
I belong<br/>
to an Umbrella group, however, which only reviews me once a year.<br/>
<br/>
Just looking for ideas on what unschoolers&#39; portfolios look like for<br/>
presentation purposes and how unschoolers pull together transcripts for <br/>
college.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not avoiding you---just slammed.<br/>
<br/>
First---each college is different. I&#39;d look around a bit for one that <br/>
is more unschooling friendly---there are a lot of them. Unfortunately, <br/>
state schools tend to be the least accomodating---they&#39;re just so far <br/>
behind the more progressive private schools! Most of the smaller <br/>
schools are going after unschoolers and don&#39;t require what they do of <br/>
traditionally schooled kids---the transcripts and grades and such. Real <br/>
life experiences and portfolios are MORE than acceptable---plus, the <br/>
unschooled kids stand out as &quot;diverse&quot; &lt;G&gt;!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s more work for the parents. The schools take on that role when <br/>
you hand your children over to them, so now that you are the &quot;head of <br/>
the school,&quot; you&#39;ll have to take on that duty too! &lt;g&gt; I&#39;d say that <br/>
it&#39;s not necessary to make it look like school as it is to make it look <br/>
interesting and different---DIVERSE! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My 17 year old is a drummer and is very intersted in music.<br/>
<br/>
I *could* label that as just &quot;Music&quot;---but it&#39;s so much more than that: <br/>
he&#39;s really into the music of the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s, so he gets credit for:<br/>
<br/>
History/Geography/Social Studies: travel  to different parts of the <br/>
country to attend music festivals and meet folks from all over; civil <br/>
rights; Viet Nam war;  presidencies of Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, & <br/>
Carter;  British invasion<br/>
<br/>
Art: music, fashion, album covers, Warhol, posters (art is not even <br/>
required in my state of SC)<br/>
<br/>
Math: half notes, 3/4 notes, etc. all that music is just math in sound<br/>
<br/>
Science: drug culture (chemistry & biology--grandfather is a Dr and <br/>
worked in Haight-Asbury in the late 60&#39;s---lots of stories to tell <br/>
about al that!&lt;g&gt;), drumming (physics), tie-dye (chemistry!)<br/>
<br/>
Literature & Composition: lyrics (reading other & writing his own)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He has a busy life *other* than music as well, so that&#39;s not where all <br/>
his learning takes place, but that&#39;s what I get *just* out of <br/>
music!---and that&#39;s not any where complete---just a sampling for right <br/>
now for you!<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t break our lives into subjects---that antithetical to <br/>
unschooling! But when you have to report to the state in any way, it <br/>
helps to be able to break it down that way!<br/>
<br/>
As for transcripts: I would just break what he&#39;s done into semester <br/>
blocks (which is what the local high schools do here) and figure out <br/>
how much time he&#39;s spent doing something. He would probably have *many* <br/>
more than the required number of credits than any local high school <br/>
student!<br/>
<br/>
I think you need to take a deep breath and think hard about what your <br/>
children have covered over a few months. It&#39;s probably quite impressive!<br/>

Amazing how easy it was to translate the state standards into an <br/>
unschooling-friendly description.<br/>
