<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775253036">A couple of months ago, I subscribed to this &quot;hand in hand nurturing <br/>
the child connection&quot; newsletter thinking it sounded nice, but have <br/>
been angry and saddened at some of the articles that are supposedly <br/>
touted as parenting tips.  I posted one below that made me cringe.  <br/>
(Tried to find just a link, but couldn&#39;t.  So sorry for the long <br/>
post.)  I can&#39;t believe anyone really thinks they are doing good for <br/>
their child when they intentionally cause their child to suffer <br/>
emotionally, cry and lose trust.  (Thank goodness for lists like <br/>
this one that promote empowerment, trust, acceptance, and <br/>
respectfulness for all family members!)    <br/>
<br/>
And yesterday I saw for the first time ever the first part of Nanny <br/>
911...I was totally shocked, shocked!! by how the Nanny wants <br/>
parents to treat their kids!  My almost three year old said, &quot;The <br/>
Nanny is stupid!&quot;  We were all so upset at how the kids were being <br/>
forced in their rooms to go to sleep and how the Nanny sat in the <br/>
doorway and blocked the poor child of about 2 or 3 yrs from <br/>
following the father while she was having a meltdown!  The worst <br/>
part (aside from what it did to the child and family) is that people <br/>
watching might actually think this is how they &quot;should&quot; be treating <br/>
their kids.  I wish compassionate, respectful and nurturing people <br/>
would be able to promote a healthier lifestyle for these families <br/>
instead!  Hey, maybe someday unschoolers will have a tv show!  Laurie<br/>

PARENTING TIP <br/>
Putting Limits on Fear<br/>
 <br/>
I had about had it with not being able to go to the bathroom alone. <br/>
My normally independent and self-directed daughter was going through <br/>
a fearful stage where she would literally scream if she discovered <br/>
she was alone in a room, even if she could hear you right in the <br/>
next one. If she had to go to the bathroom, she wanted you to come <br/>
with her.  If she needed a toy from upstairs, she would insist she <br/>
could not possibly get it without adult company. I was sorry she was <br/>
scared, but I wanted to find a way to encourage her back into living <br/>
her life without her Mommy-as-security-blanket.<br/>
<br/>
So one Sunday my husband and I spent the whole day with my daughter. <br/>
We took her out for the day with some of her friends and then the <br/>
three of us had a quiet dinner together at home.  When we were <br/>
cleaning up the kitchen after our dinner, I asked my daughter to run <br/>
upstairs and get the breakfast tray she had left at the foot of my <br/>
bed that morning.  She refused, saying she was too frightened.  <br/>
<br/>
I took a deep breath.  It had been a really good day.  I thought <br/>
maybe it was time for us both to face this fear head on.  Setting <br/>
limits isn&#39;t my favorite part of parenting.  I&#39;m not always certain <br/>
about when to nurture and when to foster independence, what is an <br/>
appropriate challenge and what is asking too much of my child.<br/>
<br/>
I bent down and looked at my daughter. Then, softly but with <br/>
certainty, I told her that I knew she could do it and that I would <br/>
stand downstairs, where I could see her go down the hall because <br/>
there&#39;s a balcony.  I reminded her that she was safe.  She began to <br/>
cry and rant that she couldn&#39;t get the breakfast tray and she would <br/>
not get the tray.  <br/>
<br/>
I was in a good place after a nice day together with my daughter and <br/>
her stepdad, so I decided to hold the limit and let the feelings <br/>
come.  I touched her shoulder and softly told her I could see that <br/>
she was afraid but that I knew she could do it and I would watch <br/>
from downstairs.  She insisted she would die of fright.  I told her <br/>
that I could see she was so scared it felt like she might die, but <br/>
that she could do it. We went back and forth like that for 45 <br/>
minutes which built into shaking and crying and at one point she <br/>
even screamed for &quot;Help!&quot; over and over.  I don&#39;t know where it came <br/>
from but there was certainly a big pile of terror packed into that <br/>
little girl. <br/>
<br/>
But she eventually did it! When she finally made it down the hall <br/>
and got the breakfast tray, she threw the tray as hard as she could <br/>
down the stairs, still crying heartily.  I gave it back to her.  She <br/>
threw it two or three more times before carrying it down into the <br/>
kitchen.  Downstairs she let me hold her while she cried the rest of <br/>
the available fears out.  &quot;You did it,&quot; I reminded her.<br/>
<br/>
Then she sat up, got herself a glass of milk and said, &quot;I&#39;m going to <br/>
watch a show before bed.&quot;  Her stepdad and I stared at one another a <br/>
bit shaken from all the emotion.  But she just walked off, into <br/>
another room, all by herself, without a backwards glance!  <br/>
<br/>
I felt so glad she could trust me with that big chunk of terror.  If <br/>
I had rushed in to rescue her, comforted her, told her I would go <br/>
with her to get the tray, she wouldn&#39;t have been able to let the <br/>
feelings out and all that nasty stuff would still be stuck inside <br/>
her festering.  This way is loud, shaky and messy, and I know I&#39;m <br/>
not helping her perfectly, but at least I know that we can both <br/>
survive whatever it is she may need to feel and still be able to <br/>
move forward with both our lives.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>im on that newsletter also, the web site is  http:// <br/>
www.handinhandparenting.org<br/>
<br/>
i dont read all the newsletters but the one you cut & pasted sounds  <br/>
consistent with their approach which is similar to aletha solther  <br/>
(aware parenting) about the need to allow children to &quot;release&quot;/  <br/>
express their emotions.<br/>
<br/>
Both aletha solther and paddy wifler (paddy is the main person behind  <br/>
the hand in hand site) seem to think that parents must decide when  <br/>
that release should happen and use limits / boundaries to help it  <br/>
come. They try to make sure its happening from a place of connection  <br/>
(so in the article you sent the family spent the day together before  <br/>
the limit was imposed), but still see it as an externally imposed event.<br/>
<br/>
aletha solther in my opinion goes further along this path � she  <br/>
encourages the practice of holding young children and allowing them  <br/>
to cry in your arms (from memory up to the age of 6 but im not sure).  <br/>
To her credit Paddy Wifler tends to focus more on playful releases  <br/>
but still the idea of limits persists with both.<br/>
<br/>
While not everyone agrees with &quot;holding&quot;... the idea of limits to  <br/>
encourage releasing seems to be extremely common even in  <br/>
&quot;alternative&quot;  circles.<br/>
<br/>
i really disagree with the limit/ release thing and had a similar  <br/>
reaction to you about that article.... but that saidive found both  <br/>
Paddy Wifler & Aletha Solther&#39;s stuff to be very useful. Their value  <br/>
is particularly in identifying the value of expressing emotions and  <br/>
ironically both have quite a lot of unschooling themes in their  <br/>
writing (for example solther was one of the first writers i read who  <br/>
argued that babies can regulate their own food and should be given  <br/>
choice to graze etc)<br/>
<br/>
If you read the stuff knowing you are not going to agree with chunks  <br/>
of it but looking for the useful gems then the hand in hand site is  <br/>
still quite interesting. I particlarly recommend the articles page  <br/>
which is:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.handinhandparenting.org/articles.html">http://www.handinhandparenting.org/articles.html</a><br/>
<br/>
actually i reprinted one of her articles on my site ages ago at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://theparentingpit.com/alternative-parenting/the-possible-and-">http://theparentingpit.com/alternative-parenting/the-possible-and-</a> <br/>
impossible-in-parenting/<br/>
<br/>
its about letting go of control and approaching parenting as being a  <br/>
learner � which struck me as very unschooly themes.<br/>
<br/>
i guess im saying... yes i agree, that particular article and the  <br/>
belief system behind it also gives me shudders. However maybe dont  <br/>
give up on that newsletter and particularly the list of articles just  <br/>
yet.<br/>
<br/>
all the best<br/>
