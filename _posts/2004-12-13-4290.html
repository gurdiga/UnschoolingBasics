<div id="ygrps-yiv-138676282">My son aged 3 years 2 months has been watching movies on video <br/>
endlessly. Today he watched about 5 movies, from approximately 11 <br/>
in the morning to 7 in the evening, stopping only for a short period <br/>
to get in the van to go drop off his sisters somewhere. I have <br/>
allowed him to watch all he wants, but to be honest I hate the fact <br/>
that he watches so much. So I am wondering, is this normal? Should <br/>
I be setting limits? Is this a phase he is going through? Should I <br/>
just let him watch all he wants until he eventually gets it out of <br/>
his system? Will he ever get it out of his system?<br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Personally, in our family we have a screen time limit. Myopia among <br/>
children is skyrocketing due to video/computer screen use (in some <br/>
places it has doubled or triped in the last 10 years.) When <br/>
children&#39;s eyes focus on a near object, such as a book, compueter <br/>
screen, or video for prolonged periods of time, in some children <br/>
their eyes will grown longer to accomodate the focusing, causing <br/>
permanent myopia.<br/>
<br/>
We also encourage the kids to take &quot;vision breaks&quot; when they&#39;re on <br/>
the computer or video games, and also encourage them to do activities <br/>
such as outdoor play that also lets their eyes focus on distant <br/>
objects as well as near ones.<br/>
<br/>
As to whether or not he will &quot;get it out of his system&quot;, I think that <br/>
depends on the child and their personality. I have one kid who will <br/>
walk away from the screen and go and do other things, and one kid who <br/>
will be forever mesmerized by any kind of screen activity. And I know <br/>
kids who, literally, have spent years where they&#39;re on a video screen <br/>
or computer game 8 - 10 hours a day and haven&#39;t grown out of it. So I <br/>
think it is highly individual. I guess the question is, do you think <br/>
it&#39;s a problem for your child? With my child who has a hard time <br/>
disengaging from screens, he also has vision problems. Therefore, we <br/>
limit the screen time to a modest amount per day and we&#39;ve discussed <br/>
the reasoning with him - that we&#39;re balancing permament problems with <br/>
his eyes and his wishes to be on the computer/video games. The other <br/>
kid doesn&#39;t have either issue and doesn&#39;t really need any limits.<br/>
<br/>
I know that screen limits don&#39;t fit within some people&#39;s definitions <br/>
of unschooling &lt;shrug&gt; but it&#39;s what works here for our family.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think the causation goes that direction. For instance, studies among Inuits showed that myopia mostly occurred once reading had been introduced. In the pre-literate populations, it only rarely occured. Among Inuits who had been taught how to read, it occurred with a hugely greater frequency. (&quot;Inuit myopia: an environmentally induced &quot;epidemic&quot;? R. W. Morgan, J. S. Speakman and S. E. Grimshaw ) So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that people who are myopic prefer to read, but that too much close-work (reading, computer, video, or even something like knitting, presumably) can induce myopia by causing the eye to change its shape.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So here we are.  I had a child, on purpose, even though I know my vision<br/>

&gt; knew my grandmother died from Alzheimer&#39;s disease.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, my kids inherited my bad teeth as well, and that&#39;s why we have them brush them twice daily. Another preventative health measure that I feel is important.  And my mom&#39;s mother died of Alzheimer&#39;s and that&#39;s why my mom is taking fish oil supplements and a daily aspirin and all of this other stuff that&#39;s supposed to forestall it. My DH&#39;s dad died of a heart attack at 42, and so he&#39;s religious about watching his cholesterol, eating habits, and exercise. There&#39;s not much we can do about the hand that was dealt us, except to play it wisely. With our son, who already has vision problems, it makes sense to work to protect his vision.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know people die in car accidents but I still strapped my baby in a car<br/>
&gt; when I wanted to go somewhere.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, but you did strap him in, presumably because children who aren&#39;t strapped in are much more likely to be injured or killed. I know that as a kid, I constantly rode around in a car with no seatbelts, but now that I have more information and better child seats/harnesses/seat belts at my disposal, I buckle my kids in. Another health measure that I feel is important. Now there have been plenty of times (esp. when they were younger) when they really didn&#39;t like being strapped in, but it&#39;s just not optional for health/safety reasons to me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I could have said no, or limited running, swinging, playing on the slide,<br/>
&gt; riding a bike, climbing trees, swimming, hiking, trampoline.  Some kids<br/>
&gt; get bitten by dogs but we have two. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids do all that stuff as well, with proper precautions. They don&#39;t run on broken glass in bare feet, play with strange, snarling dogs, or ride bikes without helmets. They also love to play computer games, video games, or watch movies. They do this with the health precaution of not having too much screen time and not too much at one sitting, the same way that they ride bikes with helmets on, because I care about the health and welfare of their growing  bodies.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Knowing genetics plays the largest roll in myopia I&#39;d limit the course of<br/>
&gt; action I&#39;d let my own fear take and not put a limit on my son&#39;s<br/>
&gt; cartooning or painting or reading or game play. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From my own research, I don&#39;t personally believe that genetics plays the largest role in myopia any longer. For instance, in some places like Singapore, myopia now afflicts 80% of the 18 year old males. In just 3 generations, it&#39;s gone from being relatively rare to almost all of the population. I don&#39;t see how genetics would explain that. Studies I&#39;ve seen have shown that we&#39;re on the same curve as Singapore, just a few years behind. Within a generation, almost all of our children will be myopic if the trend towards close-viewing continues. And since myopia is irreversible (at least with current medical care) and can lead to blindness, I, personally, would like to have my children avoid being affected. <br/>
<br/>
This year we spent $3000 on our son&#39;s eyes (yikes!) and I respect and trust his eye doctor. Her recommendation was to limit screen time and to provide ample breaks, and also to provide plenty of outdoor long-vision activities. I think it&#39;s a good recommendation for him and for our situation.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I don&#39;t see any huge benefit in unlimited screen time, at least not a huge enough benefit to offset the health issues that I feel are there. I know unschooled kids who have unlimited screen time and some of them are pretty well-balanced, and some of them live on their gaming system/screen and never come out of the house. None of them seem any happier/better adjusted/etc. than my kids. My kids know the reasons that we have for limiting screen time, and they understand them even if they don&#39;t always agree. They&#39;ve got lots of other stuff to do around here, and they do get plenty of time to watch movies or play games. My son played about an hour&#39;s worth this morning, then we went to gymnastics and the park, and now as soon as I get off the computer they&#39;re going to watch a Pokemon movie, they&#39;re hardly deprived :-)<br/>
<br/>
I also limit my own screen time, as I can feel it affecting my eyes if I&#39;m on too long. The kids know that this is just a health principle that we all follow, just like we buckle our seatbelts.<br/>

This seems rather unfair to me. You&#39;ve decided that one child has &quot;healthy&quot; viewing habits and because the other child has a higher need for video input, you&#39;re limiting them?<br/>
Different people have different needs. It isn&#39;t trusting your child to decide that they are doing more than they should of an activity. If a child wants to read more than another child, should that be limited?<br/>
If one child needs an intense amount of music and another does not, should we limit that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644011503">&lt;&lt;&lt;Isn&#39;t the crux of unschooling all about trust?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling is about trust.  But it is also about freedom and responsibility.  My 14 yo and my 5yo don&#39;t have the same amount of freedoms due to their differences in reasoning abilities.  If my 14yo wanted to disappear for the day with people I didn&#39;t really know that well, I would make sure she had her cell phone and wouldn&#39;t worry.  If my 5yo wanted to do that, I would either be accompanying them or it wouldn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
I am responsible for keeping them safe.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Different people have different needs.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes we forget this.  What is an &quot;obsession&quot; with some people is just something they like to do a lot.  They have other interests, they have friends, they see sunlight occassionally.  For others, an &quot;obsession&quot; blocks out anything and everything else.  The difference between &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; and &quot;Fatal Attraction.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I think all parents limit their children somewhat based on their fears (of the effects of pornography, the effects of white sugar, the effects of running into the street without looking, the possibility of kidnappers, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I think rather than saying all limiting is bad. Perhaps we should look instead at the basis of our fears.  Is it a few medical studies?  Is it that we know it runs in our family?  Is it that we have had direct experience with it ourselves?  Is it having a measurable bad effect on our child and how are we defining &quot;bad effect&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Then if we still have concerns...Do we have to limit or can we simply be sure to offer other choices?  Will our child listen to our fears and heed them?  Do we really have to say &quot;No, you can&#39;t&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
My youngest daughter is 5 and chose to go to school this year.  When she was a baby she had a life threatening reaction to soy (which we all know is in pretty much everything).  She has had several reactions to it when it was ingested accidentally that required a rush to the emergency room.  It all happened when she was very small and she doesn&#39;t remember anything but a rash she would also sometimes get.  We have severely limited her soy intake since infancy by only purchasing foods that didn&#39;t have soy.  She didn&#39;t even know about it I don&#39;t think because it was just the way things were.<br/>
<br/>
This year she chose to go to Kindergarten.  Being an unschooling mom, I supported that decision.  99% of the food in the cafeteria contains soy.  Michelle wants to eat in the cafeteria because she doesn&#39;t remember the reactions.  I said ok because she hadn&#39;t had a reaction in several years and the rashes started.  So she is back to taking her lunch.  She isn&#39;t happy because she doesn&#39;t have the info that I do.  She simply doesn&#39;t remember.  I am not willing to risk a serious reaction while she is at school, away from me for 8 hours.  I have done my best to explain the situation to Michelle, but she is 5yo and would still prefer to eat cafeteria food like her friends.<br/>
<br/>
I think all parents draw that line different places.  I think we need to look at where we draw the line to see if our concerns are based in reality or are we being manipulated by the media, other parents, whatever.  I know for myself, I am always looking for ways to move the line towards more freedom for the kids but for now it is absolutely drawn at the point where harm is being or has been actually caused to themselves, to others or to property.<br/>

<br/>
If it was done to the extent that it was causing problems for their <br/>
eyes, sure. It&#39;s my job as a parent to simultaneously give my <br/>
children as much freedom as I possibly can, yet also watch out for <br/>
their health, safety, and welfare. If one child was running out into <br/>
the street in front of cars, I wouldn&#39;t think it &quot;unfair&quot; to stop <br/>
them, when I don&#39;t need to stop the other one who is standing on the <br/>
sidewalk. Neither would I believe that I was unfairly limiting their <br/>
desire for running. If either of the kids is doing something to <br/>
endanger their own health or safety, I&#39;ll help that kid to make a <br/>
safer choice. Of course I want them to meet their needs, desires, and <br/>
wants, but in safe and healthy ways.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If one child needs an intense amount of music and another does not, <br/>

<br/>
Funny that you should mention that, because there are certainly times <br/>
when we have to ask DD to do just that. Her intense need for music, <br/>
music, music 24/7 often impinges on the other household member&#39;s <br/>
desire for quiet. There are times when the piano simply must be <br/>
closed up or we will all go insane :-) I would love, eventually, to <br/>
get a digital piano with headphones and it wouldn&#39;t be as much of an <br/>
issue. Being a part of a family is a balancing act that includes <br/>
everyone&#39;s needs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I find it very interesting that you make that assumption. For one <br/>
thing, because I know real life unschoolers who are not limited at <br/>
all, and do play video games 12 hours a day and have for years. I <br/>
think the ability to self-limit is something that is more in-born <br/>
than some people assume. I know unschoolers with unlimited access who <br/>
self-limit quite well and I know those who absolutely do not. <br/>
Different personalities.<br/>

I also worked in the computer gaming industry, and most of the people <br/>
I know who were totally glued to their video screens as adults had <br/>
pretty unlimited access as kids. These are kids that took apart their <br/>
home Atari units and re-wired them for fun. :-) But some of them grow <br/>
up to be adults who have serious problems de-connecting from the <br/>
screen, and often serious problems connecting with other people. I<br/>
don&#39;t see that as a particularly healthy existance.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and is now a game producer making BIG bucks. He laughingly <br/>
 </span></blockquote>said &quot;sometimes an obsession really pays off&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, often obsessions do pay off big. But that doesn&#39;t mean that the <br/>
obsessed people are happy or healthy (bigger life goals in my mind <br/>
than having Big Bucks). I knew more than a couple of millionaires in <br/>
the computer industry that couldn&#39;t drive a car, had no friends, <br/>
never saw the sun, ate pizza and Jolt cola 24/7 and lived on their <br/>
computer. None of them struck me as particularly happy, fulfilled <br/>
people and burnout and emotional issues were par for the course in <br/>
the industry (I had one development team lead that had a nervous <br/>
breakdown at work and had to be carted off, another one threw himself <br/>
off a cliff, and several more just came unglued). For my kids, I <br/>
would wish a little more balance than I experienced with many of the <br/>
people I worked with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well yeah.<br/>
&gt; Isn&#39;t the crux of unschooling all about trust?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Within reason, yeah. There have been some things I couldn&#39;t trust my <br/>
kids with, just for health and safety reasons. One of my kids had <br/>
life-threatening food allergies. When he was younger, I had to limit <br/>
what he ate and watch everything like a hawk. Now that he&#39;s older, he <br/>
can do that for himself and understands it more. Interestingly, and <br/>
counter to the prevailing unschooling mantra, even though he was so <br/>
seriously limited on food as a young child, he has no issues with <br/>
eating, food, control, etc. I don&#39;t think having a limit, for a <br/>
health reason, guarantees some horrifying future problems down the <br/>
line. I also insist on things like seatbelts and bike helmets, even <br/>
if the kids don&#39;t like them, even if they might not fully understand <br/>
the reasons for them yet. It&#39;s my job as a parent to be concerned <br/>
about their health and safety.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I try to give the kids as much freedom to decide as I <br/>
possibly can. With the exception of health and safety, they follow <br/>
their own heart&#39;s desires. And again, just because they have a limit <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re severely deprived or anything. My kids play <br/>
video games, computer games, watch videos, watch TV. They just don&#39;t <br/>
do it continuously 12 hours a day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125407646"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think unschooling is about trust.  But it is also about freedom <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and responsibility.  My 14 yo and my 5yo don&#39;t have the same amount <br/>
of freedoms due to their differences in reasoning abilities.  If my <br/>
14yo wanted to disappear for the day with people I didn&#39;t really <br/>
know that well, I would make sure she had her cell phone and <br/>
wouldn&#39;t worry.  If my 5yo wanted to do that, I would either be <br/>
accompanying them or it wouldn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
Would your 5yo *want* to disappear for the day with people she <br/>
didn&#39;t know very well?  My 5yo wouldn&#39;t, nor would my previous 2 <br/>
5yos.  But, for the sake of the argument, if a 5yo somehow spent <br/>
enough time with a group of people (that Mom didn&#39;t know very well) <br/>
to desire to disappear with them for a day I think that&#39;s a very <br/>
different situation from a child watching a lot of self-chosen <br/>
video.  It&#39;s not even in the same ballpark to me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think sometimes we forget this.  What is an &quot;obsession&quot; with <br/>
 </span></blockquote>some people is just something they like to do a lot.  They have <br/>
other interests, they have friends, they see sunlight <br/>
occassionally.  For others, an &quot;obsession&quot; blocks out anything and <br/>
everything else.  The difference between &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; <br/>
and &quot;Fatal Attraction.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you personally know anyone who has such a &quot;fatal attraction&quot; to <br/>
an activity or interest?  Someone who doesn&#39;t have any friends at <br/>
all, someone who never sees sunlight, someone who doesn&#39;t willingly <br/>
eat or sleep?  I don&#39;t.<br/>
IME that description is only used in a sarcastic/demeaning way and <br/>
doesn&#39;t at all hold up to reality.<br/>
I&#39;m speaking generally, not personally- mabye you do know someone <br/>
like this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I think all parents limit their children somewhat based on <br/>
 </span></blockquote>their fears (of the effects of pornography, the effects of white <br/>
sugar, the effects of running into the street without looking, the <br/>
possibility of kidnappers, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
True, but many fears are irrational, fearful and based on <br/>
misinformation.  I think it&#39;s more important to really look at <br/>
the &quot;why&quot; of our fears with an open mind than to control our <br/>
children in order to passify such fears.<br/>
Running into the street without looking is an obvious enough one, <br/>
but are we talking about toddlers?  An older child?  Do we not let <br/>
an older child near the road because of an irrational fear of <br/>
traffic?  This is something I need to work on- trusting my 11yo to <br/>
ride his bike further and further from home for example.  I think <br/>
there&#39;s a fine line between rational (cars can be deadly and we need <br/>
to help our children stay safe) and irrational (&quot;I know! I just <br/>
won&#39;t let him out of the house until he&#39;s 18!&quot;)<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This year she chose to go to Kindergarten.  Being an unschooling <br/>
 </span></blockquote>mom, I supported that decision.  99% of the food in the cafeteria <br/>
contains soy.  Michelle wants to eat in the cafeteria because she <br/>
doesn&#39;t remember the reactions.  I said ok because she hadn&#39;t had a <br/>
reaction in several years and the rashes started.  So she is back to <br/>
taking her lunch.  She isn&#39;t happy because she doesn&#39;t have the info <br/>
that I do.<br/>
<br/>
Is a rash as far as the reaction would go at this point?  I thought <br/>
a fatal reaction to a food was pretty much immediate.  My cousin&#39;s <br/>
4yo has a life threatening peanut allergy and she literally cannot <br/>
be near them- it&#39;s not an option to give it a try and see if she <br/>
gets a rash.<br/>
On the other hand, I have a friend whose 5yo breaks out in eczema <br/>
whenever he eats dairy, mostly on his wrists and ankles.  He <br/>
scratches like crazy when he has it.  But since she knows that&#39;s as <br/>
far as the reaction will go she lets him choose whether eating pizza <br/>
at a birthday party or ice cream with his older siblings is worth <br/>
the temporary rash.<br/>
If I were you and it was that important to my daughter to be able to <br/>
eat with her friends, the first thing I would probably do is talk to <br/>
whoever is in charge of the cafetaria food and come up with some <br/>
other options for her.  If you can get soy free foods for your home, <br/>
surely they can have some available in the cafeteria, no?<br/>
Is it the kind of cafeteria that changes the menu daily?  Mabye you <br/>
could go over the ingredients with the staff and your daughter and <br/>
come up with specific cafeteria days and brown bag it the others.<br/>

measurable bad effect on our child and how are we defining &quot;bad <br/>
effect&quot;?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how I feel about limits. We have unschooling friends whose <br/>
family has a terrible history of skin cancer. So their kids always <br/>
wear hats and long sleeves and don&#39;t go in the sun near as much as my <br/>
kids. Some might say that this is overly protective or limiting, but <br/>
they&#39;re making a decision based on their own family&#39;s history and <br/>
needs. My kids turn brown as little nuts and no-one in my family has <br/>
ever had skin cancer so while I wouldn&#39;t put them out to broil with <br/>
no protection, we don&#39;t feel that we have to be nearly that cautious <br/>
and limiting with the sun. OTOH, that family doesn&#39;t feel any need to <br/>
limit screen time while our son already has had serious problems with <br/>
his eyes. So we limit the screen time, they limit the sun time, both <br/>
families are making decisions based on what they feel is healthy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think all parents draw that line different places.  I think we <br/>

based in reality or are we being manipulated by the media, other <br/>
parents, whatever.  I know for myself, I am always looking for ways <br/>
to move the line towards more freedom for the kids but for now it is <br/>
absolutely drawn at the point where harm is being or has been <br/>
actually caused to themselves, to others or to property.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how we try to approach it as well. We&#39;re always looking for <br/>
ways to make sure our kids can take their own responsibility and have <br/>
as much freedom as possible. My son has dealt with food allergies as <br/>
well and had so many limits with food when he was younger. Now he&#39;s <br/>
old enough to understand and to manage his own allergies/food, but <br/>
when he was younger we had to limit what he could eat or we&#39;d be <br/>
taking another trip to the ER. Fortunately, we haven&#39;t seen the dire <br/>
consequences of limits that are sometimes foretold. He has no issues <br/>
with eating whatsoever! He&#39;s a much less picky eater than our <br/>
daughter who did not have the same allergy issues, go figure.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also talking with him currently about buying the X-box gaming <br/>
system that he wants, and trying to figure out ways that he can enjoy <br/>
the gaming that he wants to do, while our concerns about his eyes and <br/>
ability to disengage are also addressed. It&#39;s always a balancing act <br/>
and some kids have an easier time with self-regulating than others.<br/>

the computer industry for over a decade, but I met some seriously <br/>
screen-addicted folks. Folks who lived in their office, literally. <br/>
Moved a bed in, ordered pizza every night, and lived there. People <br/>
who never saw the sun, who didn&#39;t really communicate with other <br/>
people well or frequently. I know people who would stay up until 4:00 <br/>
am programming, then miss a 10:00 am meeting that they were really <br/>
supposed to be at. When they weren&#39;t programming, they were gaming <br/>
(and this is before the days of X-box and Nintendo 64, we actually <br/>
had real arcade video games moved into the ends of the hallways so <br/>
the developers could play games in their spare time.) Heck, some of <br/>
these people went farther than that. I worked with people who never <br/>
learned to drive a car, open a checking account, etc. etc. who were <br/>
basically hermits in their offices. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s my acquaintance with these adults who could not self-<br/>
regulate their computer/video time and seeing how it affected all <br/>
areas of their life - health, relationships, sanity :-) that doesn&#39;t <br/>
give me great faith in the no-limits=self-regulation equation. Plenty <br/>
of these people I knew grew up basically glued to their computer <br/>
screens. Of course, in those days, it was an AppleIIe or Commodore <br/>
64, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also known people who became addicted to other things of course. <br/>
I spent 10 years skydiving, and it&#39;s not uncommon for people to <br/>
become so addicted to that sport that they basically give up the rest <br/>
of their life for it - sometimes including jobs, spouses, and <br/>
families. There&#39;s even an acronym: &quot;AIDS&quot; - &quot;Air Induced Divorce <br/>
Syndrome&quot;. Basically, too much of anything can be unhealthy, and <br/>
learning to self-regulate is a great skill to have. Some people <br/>
definitely seem to have a harder time with it than others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly. Which is why our kids have tons of great opportunities <br/>
available. Basically, they live in unschooler paradise, on a cul-de-<br/>
sac with 6 unschooling kids, a large forested lot next door with a <br/>
fort and a creek, a room full of Legos, and a great homeschooling <br/>
group with lots of friends and activities. There&#39;s certainly plenty <br/>
of good opportunities around for all kinds of fun. Most of the time, <br/>
this works pretty well and the kids get a good balance. But one of my <br/>
kids has a hard time disengaging from any kind of screen, and given <br/>
the option he will always choose to stay connected, no matter how <br/>
much he might want to do something else. That&#39;s where the limits come <br/>
in, when he&#39;s been on long enough that it *is* affecting his eyes and <br/>
would affect his health. If both of my kids were like my other kid, <br/>
who has no problem disengaging, it just wouldn&#39;t be an issue.<br/>

myopia is not debatable. A situation where 80% of the population will <br/>
have a serious visual problem that is permanent and can lead to <br/>
blindness is not a trivial thing to me. You might not believe that, I <br/>
do. So we operate from different beliefs and consequently make <br/>
different decisions. Presumably, your children don&#39;t already have eye <br/>
problems, mine does. So again, I make a different decision based both <br/>
on the information I have and the situation we&#39;re in. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, I agree. And I don&#39;t justify &quot;any and every other limit&quot;. But <br/>
I do make a limit and a decision about one specific thing - eyes and <br/>
computers - for one of my kids who already has serious eye problems. <br/>
That&#39;s a health and safety issue. Perhaps I should compare it to, <br/>
say, poking a stick at another child&#39;s eyes. That&#39;s another thing I <br/>
would limit as it could lead to blindness, pain, etc.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In most circumstances, I&#39;d agree. And we did give that a try - I was <br/>
a believer in the no-limits unschooling philosophy, but it just <br/>
didn&#39;t work for my kid on this one issue. And $3000 of eye problems <br/>
and some serious vision issues later, I&#39;m not willing to let him make <br/>
the decisions on this issue right now. Maybe sometime in the future <br/>
he will, just like with his food allergies, I had to make all the <br/>
decisions about what he ate when he was too young to understand the <br/>
serious consequences of eating the wrong thing. Now he understands, <br/>
so he controls what he eats. While he couldn&#39;t safely make those <br/>

have basic communications skills and an ability to interact with <br/>
other humans in meaningful ways. That is what was missing in many of <br/>
the people I knew. Personally, I&#39;m an introvert and am pretty drawn <br/>
to computers myself, or I wouldn&#39;t have ended up in the field. I <br/>
could happily spend hours a day plunked down here in my office at <br/>
home, but I try to limit my own screen time as well. I know it&#39;s not <br/>
healthy for my body, my eyes, my soul or my family if I spend all of <br/>
my time interacting online and not as much interacting with real <br/>
people.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did these people grow up in an unschooling home?<br/>
&gt; My oldest (11) has adored video games since he was 6 and we got our <br/>
&gt; first playstation.  He has always played all he wants, which has <br/>
&gt; ranged from not turning it on some days to playing, say, up to 6 or <br/>
&gt; 7 hours in a day (a generous estimate and usually when he has a new <br/>
&gt; game).  He doesn&#39;t like pizza, has plenty of friends, loves the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>sun, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and can&#39;t wait to drive a car.  He spends lots of time on the <br/>
&gt; computer but certainly doesn&#39;t live there.<br/>
&gt; I honestly can&#39;t think of anything he&#39;d want to do for 12 <br/>
&gt; continuous, unbroken hours.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s great. I know lots of well-balanced unschooling kids like <br/>
that. My daughter is like that as well. She loves computer games, but <br/>
has lots of other interests and can easily walk away. However, there <br/>
are some kids who have a much harder time self-regulating and cannot <br/>
so easily disengage from a computer. Sounds like your kid isn&#39;t one <br/>
of them, which is great, you really haven&#39;t had to deal with this <br/>
situation. As a mom who has, who tried no-limits and found it just <br/>
didn&#39;t work, I&#39;m giving the original poster on this thread the <br/>
benefit of my experience as well as the benefit of others who have <br/>
different opinions. For some reason, when people post not to ever <br/>
limit, their personal choice doesn&#39;t come under fire. When people <br/>
post anything about limits, it does. For us, limiting the screen time <br/>
works well. My kids are happy, engaged, and enjoy many activities, <br/>
including (but not limited to) computers, video games, DVD&#39;s, etc. <br/>
For others, not limiting might work just as well. It certainly works <br/>
fine with my daughter, it doesn&#39;t with my son. It&#39;s nice to hear more <br/>
than one party line when someone has a question along these lines, <br/>
and that&#39;s why I occasionally do post with my experience. But every <br/>
time I do, I know it will be extensively questioned, which is a bit <br/>
exhausting, so I don&#39;t do it very frequently. It&#39;s a bit too bad, <br/>
really, because then people only get to hear a certain subset of <br/>
experience, and others who might also have opinions to offer stay <br/>
silent.<br/>
<br/>
This is our experience, it works well for us. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found <br/>
something that works well for you.<br/>

It seems like you&#39;re drawing a connection between unschooling <br/>
parents not imposing screen limits on their children with the <br/>
possiblity that as a result they will grow up to be adults who <br/>
cannot communicate with other people, never learn to drive a car, <br/>
open a checking account, become hermits in their offices, etc.<br/>
Is that the connetion you are meaning to make?  Because using adults <br/>
who weren&#39;t even unschooled as children as examples isn&#39;t the best <br/>
way to attempt to prove your argument, I don&#39;t think.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Possibly.  But it seems more likely to me that what looks like <br/>
a &quot;harder time&quot; self-regulating is actually just a child who enjoys <br/>
that activity more.  Out of 3 sons I have 2 that *really* enjoy <br/>
video games and spend a lot of their time doing things that involve <br/>
screens.  My middle son hardly ever touches video games- never has <br/>
liked them much, and will generally only play reluctantly when <br/>
that&#39;s what a friend wants to do.  I see it clearly for what it is- <br/>
this child doesn&#39;t enjoy video games as much as his brothers.  He&#39;s <br/>
more into other things.  Or I could see him as &quot;better&quot; at self-<br/>
regulating and his brothers as having a &quot;harder&quot; time with it, then <br/>
panic and limit his brothers.  I think I&#39;d be doing them all a <br/>
disservice if I did that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think sometimes people say &quot;no limits&quot; but what they mean is &quot;no <br/>
arbitrary rules limiting a kids&#39; behavior.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For example - if I notice one of my daughters is spending 16 hours a <br/>
day watching Nickelodeon then I will definitely stop and give it some <br/>
thought. I&#39;m not going to just say, &quot;no limits - she can do what she <br/>
wants,&quot; to myself. I&#39;m going to think, &quot;What is going on with her that <br/>
she&#39;s doing this?&quot; I&#39;m not going to jump from &quot;She&#39;s watching 16 hours <br/>
per day of television&quot; to &quot;You&#39;re limited to two hours per day.&quot; There <br/>
are a LOT of other alternatives that don&#39;t involve ME imposing <br/>
arbitrary limits - and it IS arbitrary. Why two hours? Why not 1 hour? <br/>
Why not 2 hours today and 3 tomorrow and 1 the next day? Any time <br/>
limits set like that are just something the parent came up with - <br/>
arbitrarily.<br/>
<br/>
If I notice that one of my kids gets really grouchy and cranky after <br/>
watching hours of tv, I&#39;ll be responsive to that, but NOT by setting <br/>
arbitrary limits. If I notice that one of my kids gets &quot;hooked&quot; on <br/>
watching tv and doesn&#39;t seem to quite have the ability to turn it off <br/>
even though I think that if she did, she&#39;d have more fun doing <br/>
something else, then I&#39;ll be responsive to THAT, too. But not with <br/>
arbitrary rules and limits.<br/>
<br/>
There are other options. I&#39;m more capable than that - I can do better.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing I do is inside my OWN head - I ask myself what I think <br/>
is going on, what I&#39;m worried about, how reasonable is my fear and all <br/>
that (as Julie described). AND I ask myself whether I&#39;m giving my child <br/>
enough credit - have I given her time or am I ready to &quot;do something&quot; <br/>
based on a few days or even just a few weeks of behavior - I try to <br/>
talk myself into being more patient (because i&#39;m a &#39;do something&#39; kind <br/>
of person). I try to think about why she&#39;s doing what she&#39;s doing - try <br/>
to think about it from her perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes what I come up with is that I was just about to interrupt <br/>
something that is important for her --  the teenager watching <br/>
Nickelodeon 16 hours per day might be deeply deeply thinking about her <br/>
future, might be scared and confused and needing a TON of internal time <br/>
- sitting in front of non-demanding tv is a way to be &#39;doing something&#39; <br/>
while our brains can process other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe I come up with the possibility that she&#39;s depressed and <br/>
avoiding life and I need to figure out how to approach that.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many possibilities - if I just say to myself, &quot;She&#39;s <br/>
watching TOO much tv, it isn&#39;t good for her, I&#39;m going to limit her to <br/>
2 hours per day,&quot; then I&#39;ve really missed the boat.<br/>
<br/>
There have been times when I felt like one of my kids was being too <br/>
sedentary and spending too much time on the computer or watching tv <br/>
than was good for them, physically. I certainly know THIS problem - I <br/>
have the same tendency, myself.  But, the solution has never been to <br/>
impose arbitrary limits, but to entice them into some more physical <br/>
endeavors that they LIKE.<br/>
<br/>
Teachers close the blinds in classrooms so the kids will pay attention <br/>
to them. It would be better if the opened the windows and doors and <br/>
said, &quot;You&#39;re not only free to look out, but free to go out.&quot; And then <br/>
the teachers would have to make what was happening in the classroom <br/>
enticing enough to keep their attention.<br/>
<br/>
When kids watch &quot;too much tv&quot; for the parents&#39; comfort level - for <br/>
whatever reasons (not arguing about whether those are legitimate or <br/>
not) - and if the parents have given thought to what all that time <br/>
spent is meaning for the kid, etc., then I think parents at least ought <br/>
to entice the kids away, not restrict them.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to once in a while tell me to put down my book and go <br/>
outside. She thought I read too much and it was going to be bad for my <br/>
eyes. I used to sneak a book out, under my shirt, and go find a hidden <br/>
spot to sit and read out there.<br/>
<br/>
Arbitrary rules and limits have the added characteristic that they <br/>
entice kids to think about how they can get around them and can even <br/>
entice kids to cheat and lie. I know a couple of really really great <br/>
unschooled kids whose parents set limits on their computer use time. <br/>
The kids used to get up in the middle of the night to use the computer <br/>
while their parents were asleep. It is an unintended but very very <br/>
predictable side effect of rules and limits that they set parents and <br/>
children up as adversaries and can lead to kids feeling guilty and <br/>
sneaky when they inevitably bend or even outright break the rules. <br/>
Avoiding that kind of possibility is one really good reason for not <br/>
having rules or limits at all.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I think unschooling is about trust.  But it is also about freedom <br/>
  and responsibility.  My 14 yo and my 5yo don&#39;t have the same amount <br/>
  of freedoms due to their differences in reasoning abilities.  If my <br/>
  14yo wanted to disappear for the day with people I didn&#39;t really <br/>
  know that well, I would make sure she had her cell phone and <br/>
  wouldn&#39;t worry.  If my 5yo wanted to do that, I would either be <br/>
  accompanying them or it wouldn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
  Would your 5yo *want* to disappear for the day with people she <br/>
  didn&#39;t know very well?  My 5yo wouldn&#39;t, nor would my previous 2 <br/>
  5yos.  But, for the sake of the argument, if a 5yo somehow spent <br/>
  enough time with a group of people (that Mom didn&#39;t know very well) <br/>
  to desire to disappear with them for a day I think that&#39;s a very <br/>
  different situation from a child watching a lot of self-chosen <br/>
  video.  It&#39;s not even in the same ballpark to me.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I think sometimes we forget this.  What is an &quot;obsession&quot; with <br/>
  some people is just something they like to do a lot.  They have <br/>
  other interests, they have friends, they see sunlight <br/>
  occassionally.  For others, an &quot;obsession&quot; blocks out anything and <br/>
  everything else.  The difference between &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; <br/>
  and &quot;Fatal Attraction.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Would your 5yo *want* to disappear for the day with people she <br/>
  didn&#39;t know very well?  Someone who doesn&#39;t have any friends at <br/>
  all, someone who never sees sunlight, someone who doesn&#39;t willingly <br/>
  eat or sleep?  I don&#39;t.<br/>
  IME that description is only used in a sarcastic/demeaning way and <br/>
  doesn&#39;t at all hold up to reality.<br/>
  I&#39;m speaking generally, not personally- mabye you do know someone <br/>
  like this.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; So I think all parents limit their children somewhat based on <br/>
  their fears (of the effects of pornography, the effects of white <br/>
  sugar, the effects of running into the street without looking, the <br/>
  possibility of kidnappers, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
  True, but many fears are irrational, fearful and based on <br/>
  misinformation.  I think it&#39;s more important to really look at <br/>
  the &quot;why&quot; of our fears with an open mind than to control our <br/>
  children in order to passify such fears.<br/>
  Running into the street without looking is an obvious enough one, <br/>
  but are we talking about toddlers?  An older child?  Do we not let <br/>
  an older child near the road because of an irrational fear of <br/>
  traffic?  This is something I need to work on- trusting my 11yo to <br/>
  ride his bike further and further from home for example.  I think <br/>
  there&#39;s a fine line between rational (cars can be deadly and we need <br/>
  to help our children stay safe) and irrational (&quot;I know! I just <br/>
  won&#39;t let him out of the house until he&#39;s 18!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; This year she chose to go to Kindergarten.  Being an unschooling <br/>
  mom, I supported that decision.  99% of the food in the cafeteria <br/>
  contains soy.  Michelle wants to eat in the cafeteria because she <br/>
  doesn&#39;t remember the reactions.  I said ok because she hadn&#39;t had a <br/>
  reaction in several years and the rashes started.  So she is back to <br/>
  taking her lunch.  She isn&#39;t happy because she doesn&#39;t have the info <br/>
  that I do.<br/>
<br/>
  Is a rash as far as the reaction would go at this point?  I thought <br/>
  a fatal reaction to a food was pretty much immediate.  My cousin&#39;s <br/>
  4yo has a life threatening peanut allergy and she literally cannot <br/>
  be near them- it&#39;s not an option to give it a try and see if she <br/>
  gets a rash.<br/>
  On the other hand, I have a friend whose 5yo breaks out in eczema <br/>
  whenever he eats dairy, mostly on his wrists and ankles.  He <br/>
  scratches like crazy when he has it.  But since she knows that&#39;s as <br/>
  far as the reaction will go she lets him choose whether eating pizza <br/>
  at a birthday party or ice cream with his older siblings is worth <br/>
  the temporary rash.<br/>
  If I were you and it was that important to my daughter to be able to <br/>
  eat with her friends, the first thing I would probably do is talk to <br/>
  whoever is in charge of the cafetaria food and come up with some <br/>
  other options for her.  If you can get soy free foods for your home, <br/>
  surely they can have some available in the cafeteria, no?<br/>
  Is it the kind of cafeteria that changes the menu daily?  Mabye you <br/>
  could go over the ingredients with the staff and your daughter and <br/>
  come up with specific cafeteria days and brown bag it the others.<br/>

focusing at short distances causes myopia, then reading would be a <br/>
big culprit while video games would be less so.  None of my children <br/>
sit close to the screen when they play a game.  My 5yo is playing <br/>

the past?  If so, for how long?  And during that time did he <br/>
honestly engage with a screen non-stop from the time he woke up <br/>

it out and also check out the source.  I know very few people with <br/>
serious eye problems.  My own children have excellent vision, <br/>
confirmed by their latest skateboard camp physical.  The people that <br/>
I know that have serious vision problems are middle aged or older <br/>

 </span></blockquote>A myopic person looking at a computer screen too long, to you, is <br/>
tantamount to having a stick poked in one&#39;s eye?  I&#39;m not <br/>
following.  I&#39;ve heard of myopia and I&#39;ve heard of needing to wear <br/>
glasses to see correctly, but I&#39;ve honestly never heard of too much <br/>
computer time leading to blindness.  Could you refer me to your <br/>

negative light.  I almost did see it that way when we first got <br/>
video games around here and my son played hours on end and late into <br/>
the night.  I wrestled in my mind with exactly what you&#39;re talking <br/>
about, tried to observe my son clearly and without judgement, and <br/>
decided to wait and trust.  I&#39;m glad I did.<br/>

&gt; silent.<br/>
<br/>

examination of ideas and opinions- which is a good thing.  I&#39;d say <br/>
it&#39;s not a good idea to post an idea or an opinion that you&#39;re not <br/>
willing to have questioned, but you already know that!  :-)<br/>

You do see that is different than arbitrarily saying that she must play <br/>
no more than 2 hours per day, right? That&#39;s not &#39;setting limits&#39; as <br/>
most people mean the words - that is expecting everybody in the family <br/>
to be considerate.<br/>
<br/>
If nobody was home, she could play for 16 straight hours - it would be <br/>
fine. That wouldn&#39;t be true if we had a rule about how much piano she <br/>
was allowed per day.<br/>

unschooled?  I grew up addicted to reading.  I would literally have <br/>
my nose in a book if there wasn&#39;t some other (lesser) task to do.  <br/>
However, rather than being supported by my family and encouraged to <br/>
pursue my reading I was the joke in the family (especially among my <br/>
aunts, uncles and cousins.)  I was taunted and called names.  <br/>
Bookworm, know-it-all, Marian Librarian, etc.  I actually was shamed <br/>
for reading!  I wonder about other adults who are in obsessive <br/>
behaviors and how they were (dis)respected as children for the <br/>
obsessions.  I think it is ok to have an obsession as long as it <br/>
doesn&#39;t become obsessive KWIM?  <br/>
<br/>
My xh would be that obsessive computer guy if it weren&#39;t for the <br/>
fact that his mother and father (while having other issues) did <br/>
support him in his obsessions.  They allowed him to make bombs out <br/>
of black powder and film canisters and blow things up.  They let him <br/>
dink with computers and other electronics (this was prior to the age <br/>
of home computers)  He has counterparts who grew up being called <br/>
geek (in a bad way) and nerd.  (We use the term geek as something to <br/>
live up to in our house LOL!) They are the ones that are obsessive.  <br/>
<br/>
I see the same behaviours in other things as well.  Artists who do <br/>
nothing but art and don&#39;t sell anything and are always living hand <br/>
to mouth.  They were the kids who were told that they needed to <br/>
amount to more than &quot;just an artist.&quot;  Would-be novelists.  <br/>
Engineers.  Gardeners.  Doctors, even!  I wonder what their lives <br/>
would be like had they been unschooled and given the chance and <br/>
enouragement to pursue their desires!<br/>

12 or more hours a day.  The TV in this room is on,<br/>
from when Democracy Now got over an hour ago.  It&#39;s<br/>
on, and I&#39;m listening, but I&#39;m also responding to<br/>
email and instant messaging a friend.  I&#39;ve also<br/>
showered, highlighted my hair, given myself a trim,<br/>
blowdried my hair, made two cups of coffee, and walked<br/>
to dogs while the TV has been on.  My 6 yo&#39;s tv is on<br/>
as well.  It came on as soon as she woke up.  She is<br/>
sitting in this room, on the floor, making some kind<br/>
of sign that she&#39;s taping up and won&#39;t show me. She&#39;s<br/>
waiting for the computer to play another rousing game<br/>
of zoo tycoon, which she played for a few hours last<br/>
night. My 12 yo&#39;s TV will no doubt come on as soon as<br/>
she wakes up as well. But during the day they will<br/>
play games, draw, write, read, cook, eat, wrestle,<br/>
come to chat with me, tivo something and call me in to<br/>
see it, go to play with friends, etc, etc, etc.  Just<br/>
because the tv is on all day doesn&#39;t mean they are<br/>
watching ALL DAY.  I admit, to some who don&#39;t pay<br/>
attention, it might look like that though.<br/>

to limits, we went through a long thought process and tried various <br/>
things with very limited success. I would pretty much assume that <br/>
most unschoolers would try to creatively problem solve and find other <br/>
solutions - I know we did.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I would think so too. But I would also think that after a couple <br/>
of years of this, where many different possibilities were tried, many <br/>
different approaches thought about, and the parent came to using a <br/>
limit as a viable solution and it worked well for everyone concerned, <br/>
that it shouldn&#39;t be seen as a problem. I don&#39;t think an automatic <br/>
knee-jerk limit response is the way to go in any situation. But I <br/>
think it&#39;s one tool in a parents toolbag of possible approaches, and <br/>
I don&#39;t personally think of it as the horrifying prospect that some <br/>
people do here. <br/>

better? Just curious...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; children up as adversaries and can lead to kids feeling guilty and <br/>
&gt; sneaky when they inevitably bend or even outright break the rules.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a possibility, but it&#39;s not a given. I don&#39;t personally <br/>
believe that one thing leads to another. As a kid, my parents limited <br/>
my own television watching (well, they eventually got rid of the <br/>
television, LOL). I didn&#39;t sneak around, wasn&#39;t interested in <br/>
watching it at friend&#39;s houses, and didn&#39;t become a television junky <br/>
the second I moved out of the house. I didn&#39;t own a TV for years as <br/>
an adult, though I do now and do enjoy watching some shows. I don&#39;t <br/>
think TV is inherently evil, but I also don&#39;t resent my parents&#39; <br/>
views or their limits on it either. &lt;shrug&gt;  I could just as easily <br/>
say &quot;It is an unintended but very very predictable side effect of few <br/>
rules and limits that children become unruly, wild, and unmanageable <br/>
and that the relationship between parents and kids becomes strained.&quot; <br/>
Now that&#39;s not any more true than what you said, but I have seen it <br/>
happen in a couple of families. The fact is, that family dynamics are <br/>
way more complicated than these simplistic predictions. I love and <br/>
respect my kids, they love and respect me. I try not to make too many <br/>
arbitrary rules or limits, they do understand and respect the ones I <br/>
do make. So far, it&#39;s working well. If it starts to not work well, <br/>
we&#39;ll think about, adjust, and change. And the predictions of doom <br/>
and gloom due to one limit in their life, I guess I&#39;m just not too <br/>
worried about it.<br/>

watching&quot;.  I also doubt that anyone could do anything<br/>
for 12 hours straight--videos, TV, books, skydiving. <br/>
There has to be time for bathroom breaks and eating,<br/>
and after that my children are seldom up for much more<br/>
than 12 hours!  Again, I think the video game might be<br/>
on for 12 hours, but it has a &quot;pause&quot; button and I<br/>
suggest that it might only &quot;look&quot; like people are<br/>
playing it for 12 hours straight, day after day...<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, reading is as big of a culprit. In fact, myopia is exceedingly <br/>
rare in pre-literate populations of people. As for screen distance, I <br/>
wish I could keep my kids away from sitting right next to the screen. <br/>
For some reason, they love to do that. I&#39;ll come in and they&#39;ll <br/>
actually have their noses almost on the screen. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did I read in another post that you tried no limits on screens in <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And during that time did he <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, any attempt at any other activity was met with tantrums. Even <br/>
attempts to disengage him to go to an activity that he had asked me <br/>
to set up for him (a playdate, a homeschool group activity)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why, do you think, a person <br/>

&gt; again.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A predictable response (that last sentence). No, there was no threat <br/>
of taking it away as at that point and time, I was totally bought in <br/>
to the unschooling-means-no-limits point of view. I saw them as the <br/>
evil incarnate that they&#39;ve been portrayed as on various unschooling <br/>
lists.  As to why? I don&#39;t know. Why can I have a beer after dinner <br/>
and not want another one, while my good friend can never touch a beer <br/>
without wanting 20? Why can some people self-regulate with food or <br/>
alcohol or tobacco or books or chatrooms or pornography and some <br/>
people can&#39;t?? If you could answer that question, you could make a <br/>
billion bucks, I&#39;d bet.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I know never to take a good fast-paced book to bed with me <br/>
unless I want to be tired and grumpy the next day because my brain <br/>
can&#39;t stop reading until I&#39;ve finished it. Some people&#39;s brains in <br/>
some ways just have a hard time disconnecting. &lt;shrug&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 80 percent?  Where did you get this information?  I&#39;d like to check <br/>
&gt; it out and also check out the source.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, originally it was in an article I read in a magazine. The <br/>
article referenced Singapore, which has had an explosive growth in <br/>
myopia, and also mentioned that the U.S. is on the same curve as <br/>
Singapore, but a few years behind. <br/>
<br/>
Just googling myopia and Singapore brought up:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.snec.com.sg/ecp/childhood_myopia.asp">http://www.snec.com.sg/ecp/childhood_myopia.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
A quote from that site: &quot;Myopia is a rapidly worsening public health <br/>
problem in Singapore. Surveys have indicated that myopia afflicts 25% <br/>
of 7 year olds, 33% of 9 year olds, 50% of 12 year olds and more than <br/>
80% of 18 year old males in Singapore. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A myopic person looking at a computer screen too long, to you, is <br/>
&gt; tantamount to having a stick poked in one&#39;s eye?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, but both are behaviors that could, possibly, lead to blindness. <br/>
One in the very immediate short term - with a poke. One in the very <br/>
slow long-term. If 80% of males are at risk for myopia by the time <br/>
they reach 18, and myopia is incurable and can lead to blindness, <br/>
then yes the risk is there. <br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; problems that needed addressing?<br/>

existing problem. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I *would* have had to &quot;deal&quot; with it if I had chosen to see it in a <br/>
&gt; negative light.  I almost did see it that way when we first got <br/>

 </span></blockquote>into <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the night.  I wrestled in my mind with exactly what you&#39;re talking <br/>
&gt; about, tried to observe my son clearly and without judgement, and <br/>
&gt; decided to wait and trust.  I&#39;m glad I did.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I too waited and trusted, and the outcome was different for me <br/>
and my kid. I wonder why you have such a hard time believing that <br/>
people are different? After all, a good friend of mine is a walking <br/>
twig, yet can eat anything she wants to. If we go out to dinner, she <br/>
orders two entrees to my one. Yet she doesn&#39;t gain a pound. I think <br/>
it would be a bit ludicrous of her to tell me that because she <br/>
doesn&#39;t gain any weight that I could eat exactly as she does and be <br/>
equally skinny. She has a different body, different metabolism, etc. <br/>
than I do. What works for her doesn&#39;t work for me and vice versa. So <br/>
while she eats her two entrees, I eat 75% of mine and run 8 miles the <br/>
next day and still outweigh her by 30 pounds. Oh well, that is just <br/>
the way life is. I&#39;m glad that your kids don&#39;t have a problem <br/>
disengaging from the screen, just like I&#39;m glad my friend can eat her <br/>
double cheesecake and not gain an ounce.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a &quot;party line,&quot; I think there is careful <br/>

&gt; it&#39;s not a good idea to post an idea or an opinion that you&#39;re not <br/>
&gt; willing to have questioned, but you already know that!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah, I&#39;ve been on these boards enough years to know what will and <br/>
won&#39;t get questioned. But I also know that only a narrow subset of <br/>
opinions get heard because of that. It&#39;s a double-edged sword. Some <br/>
good comes of it, and also some bad. I know people that lurk here and <br/>
elsewhere and won&#39;t post their views because they don&#39;t want to open <br/>
themselves up to the constant barrage. Myself, I&#39;ve got a fairly <br/>
thick skin, I know what&#39;s working well for us, and the rest doesn&#39;t <br/>
bother me too much.<br/>

you end up having? Personally, I think it&#39;s rude to ask someone else <br/>
to drive 20 minutes to meet you at a playground only to not show up <br/>
because your kid at the last minute decided he wanted to keep on <br/>
playing his video game when he is the one who wanted his friend to <br/>
meet him at the playground in the first place. And the point is that <br/>
even things he *wanted* to do and *asked* to do were no longer <br/>
appealing once he was in front of a screen.<br/>
