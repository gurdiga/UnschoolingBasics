<div id="ygrps-yiv-757718447">I like Reviving Ophelia. Okay, wait, I didn&#39;t really *like* it, because it<br/>
was a bit of a painful read. ;) I did like the things it make me think about<br/>
my *own* adolescence, however. It gave me clarity about what messages I, as<br/>
a woman, send to younger women in the world; especially my daughter.<br/>
Not a book for perspective on your unschooled daughter, a book for<br/>
perspective on the woman who is mothering your unschooled daughter &lt;3<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267442386">I wanted to say that while I liked reviving ophelia, when I read it, waaaay before I was unschooling, it does not come from an unschooling perspective at all, and in fact has a “matrix” it uses  - a matrix of control vs. acceptance, that is supposed to indicate the best likelihood of a “good” outcome with a teen.  the combo she says is “best” is high control/high acceptance, yielding teens who are “independent, socially responsible, and confident” – whereas she warns that low control/high acceptance,  (which she calls *indulgent parenting*) yields high impulsivity, low independence and low responsibility.   she calls the “best” families “strict but loving” and says the message that is sent that works is “we love you but you have to do what we say.”<br/>
<br/>
so – yeah – a bit antithetical to unschooling.  diana – were you able to just ignore this stuff to get to the meat, or perhaps there’s a new edition that is different?<br/>
<br/>
the book I read after reviving ophelia, and actually liked more – but it’s been about 13 years since I’ve read it, so I may be forgetting something, is called “growing a girl” – however, as I read the review of that on amazon, it sounds like it’s a pretty far stretch from that to unschooling as well.     <br/>
<br/>
I have truly gained the most from just devouring unschooling writing about teens, in addition to the book  parent-teen breakthrough.  every time I read something that is not from that perspective, I either feel pulled backward to a more controlling and fearful mindset, or I find it un-useful and not worth reading.    so depending on where you are at with it all, and what you are needing, you might consider how many “voices” you want floating around in your head about the “right” way to do things.<br/>
<br/>
warmly, lyla<br/>
