<div id="ygrps-yiv-69805106">Hey, guys!  I have a situation to ponder that I would really <br/>
appreciate your input on.  I&#39;m sure I raised a similar question last <br/>
year as this situation is not new.<br/>
<br/>
A little history...<br/>
<br/>
Pat and I have been together for almost 10 years.  We were recently <br/>
married, so now I&#39;m officially step-mom to five children in addition <br/>
to being mother to two, nana to one...soon to be nana to two more.  <br/>
Anyway, needless to say ALL of the children have been raised as if <br/>
they were my own.  <br/>
<br/>
The four oldest went through public school and are young adults <br/>
now.  Two of them live on their own, and one is preparing to venture <br/>
out soon.  Plus, we have our oldest back home expecting her first <br/>
child and anticipating bed rest in the next month or two.  Of the <br/>
remaining three children there are two in public school, Pat&#39;s two <br/>
youngest, and one unschooler, my youngest.<br/>
<br/>
I would love nothing more than to bring the two youngest home.  The <br/>
biggest issue is with our youngest girl, Amie.  She is the reason <br/>
for my post.  Last year was a tough year for our family.  Things <br/>
seem to touch her in a different way.  She will be 16 in March, is <br/>
very sensitive, artistic and a &quot;typical&quot; middle child.  Up until <br/>
last year she was always a so-called average student in school.  <br/>
Well, last year brought many failed classes.  I did everything I <br/>
knew how to encourage &quot;showing up&quot; for her classes.  She was there <br/>
physically, but didn&#39;t do the work.  It seemed nothing interested <br/>
her, and she just didn&#39;t participate in the academics.<br/>
<br/>
Well, here it is a new year, 10th grade for her, and we are <br/>
on &quot;instant replay&quot;.  She is failing most of her classes, and will <br/>
likely not graduate with her class.  Pat, being school minded, is <br/>
worried.  Honestly, I am worried as well.  Part of me wonders why <br/>
she is okay with failing and does nothing to try to succeed.  <br/>
<br/>
There are aspects of unschooling that I am still growing into.  I <br/>
wish I was stronger and more grounded in my beliefs and <br/>
understanding of this area of my life.  So, in spite of this fact, <br/>
I&#39;ve decided to back off on the education aspect, and Pat is in <br/>
agreement with me to this point.  Honestly, he doesn&#39;t really know <br/>
anything much about unschooling.  I find it strange that he never <br/>
really asks me about Adrians progress and those typical school based <br/>
questions we tend to hear.  He gives me my space and trusts my <br/>
judgement.  I&#39;m not sure that he would be the same when it came to <br/>
Amie, especially due to her age.  <br/>
<br/>
We have discussed home schooling in the past but decided against it <br/>
due to the &quot;ex&quot; factor.  Especially with us not being married at the <br/>
time, we just didn&#39;t want to wade into those waters.  Plus, I don&#39;t <br/>
know how easy it would be for me to influence an unschooling <br/>
lifestyle on a man that is so school minded.<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooler at heart and a mom trying her best to provide an <br/>
unschooling way of life I find this situation confusing.  Some of <br/>
the points I ponder are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Should she quit school?<br/>
<br/>
2.  How do I provide an opportunity for her that her father, and she <br/>
for that matter, doesn&#39;t understand?<br/>
<br/>
3.  How do I create an atmosphere in relation to an unschooling <br/>
lifestyle for a child in public school?<br/>
<br/>
4.  In what way and what points should I try to expose my husband <br/>
and daughter to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
5.  What are the characteristics of a child that would effectively <br/>
drop out of public school to pursue their own interests?  <br/>
<br/>
6.  Could Amie handle this transition?<br/>
<br/>
7.  Could we handle this transition?<br/>
<br/>
8.  What expecations would we have as parents from a child in such a <br/>
situation?<br/>
<br/>
9.  How could we effectively discuss this as a family?<br/>
<br/>
10.  What alternatives are there in this situation aside from <br/>
changing schools and/or coming home?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t misunderstand me.  These are not point blank questions for <br/>
anyone to answer.  They are merely a &quot;bird&#39;s eye view&quot; of the <br/>
confusion going on inside my head.  Has anyone here ever been <br/>
there/done that?  Even if you haven&#39;t, what do you think?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

Have you ever read The Teenage Liberation Handbook by Grace Llewelyn? I suggest getting a copy. it will give you, your daughter and your husband a good starting off place for unschooling discussions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;1.  Should she quit school?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I prefer to think of it as starting something rather than quitting something. If she&#39;s unhappy at school and uninterested in playing the social or academic game, then I&#39;d encourage her to start looking at what would interest her outside of school. She&#39;s obviously not getting much from being in the system. Let her out!<br/>
<br/>
As far as how it will all work and transition, take it one day at a time. <br/>

I did read it in the beginning of my unschooling journey.  I was <br/>
thinking about it again.  I did make it available to our daughter <br/>
last year when this came up, but she didn&#39;t bite.  Even then I <br/>
offered to act as her advocate and back her up when she was ready to <br/>
make a decision about what she wanted.  <br/>

I plan to request both that book and the other book, &quot;Real Lives&quot;, <br/>

to purchase them Online?<br/>

exhausted!  On top of that I struggle with pangs of guilt for not <br/>
being able to dedicate the amount of time required to make progress <br/>
with pressing situations, as they seem to be arising daily around <br/>
here.  How do you resolve pressing issues when they are coming at <br/>

Read it TO them. I read TLH to Cameron when we were vacationing in the mountains one week. He had <br/>
lots of questions---esp since he was still just starting out.<br/>
 <br/>
Finding other unschoolers would be a BIG help.<br/>

Amazon and half.com, but if you have the $$ and can support the author, you can get it directly from her. If <br/>
you call, you&#39;ll probably talk with Maia, who is happy to take your order. But you can order online too.<br/>

Sorry. I have two that are eight years apart. I can divide myself between them pretty well. <br/>
 <br/>
But I DO have a zillion other things that take my time. I tend to get up a little earlier. I can <br/>
sometimes grab a nap in the afternoons if I need it. But I can put aside the pesky *extras* I take on---<br/>
not my kids.   Ren?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000474498">Well, I began to take the advice given on the topic of pulling my <br/>
step-daughter out of public school, 10th grade.  Today Pat was home, <br/>
totally out of the ordinary, so we picked Amie up together.  We had <br/>
a few minutes in the car.  I took advantage of the time and brought <br/>
up my ideas in regard to reading the Teenage Liberation Handbook <br/>
together.  I explained a few of my concerns and how I thought Amie <br/>
would benefit from being home.  He bit!  <br/>
<br/>
We discussed our thoughts with Amie on the way home and decided that <br/>
we would research together, me and her, since we would be the ones <br/>
most involved.  We also discussed including &quot;Dad&quot; in the loop and <br/>
educating ourselves, all of us, together.  We shared our concerns <br/>
and ideas, and...she bit!<br/>
<br/>
So, we&#39;ll see what happens from here...<br/>

<br/>
Be prepared for her to want to sleep....alot.  What does she want to do?  Is she interested in anything in particular?  Getting a job?  Doing an apprenticeship?  Being in community theatre? Taking classes at the community college?<br/>
<br/>
I would invite her along to movies, concerts, herb talks, hikes, etc..  Think of it as life long summer vacation and her interests will come to the surface.<br/>
<br/>
Just remember to take things slow.  There is no rush.  She doesn&#39;t have to have her &quot;education&quot; crammed in before she turns 18.<br/>

Take it slowly. Pretend it&#39;s summer vacation. Around here, we say, &quot;Every day is Saturday, and every month is July.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Rent movies (Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off, for starters! &lt;G&gt;). Do movie verticals---like all the Johnny Depp movies in order. All the Susan Sarandon movies. Or all Hitchcock. Or all movies with horses in them---just pick and actor/director/time period/subject and just watch---in your PJs, with pizza delivered and plenty of popcorn. Maybe for days on end.<br/>
 <br/>
Pack up and GOOOO. Spend a week at Williamsburg or Gettysburg or the Grand Canyon. Get a cheap hotel at the beach or in the mountains. Visit sweet, non-judgmental grandparents or cousins or godmothers for a few days. Or hell, get in touch with some of us unschoolers and roadtrip a few states away! &lt;G&gt; We ALWAYS love to meet/host travelling unschoolers!<br/>
 <br/>
Pick up a new hobby: beekeeping, puppy-raising a guide dog puppy, butterfly gardening, learning magic, playing an instrument, cycling (road &/or mountain), Japanese cooking, making ATCs, playing duplicate bridge. Be interested! Be interesting! (All those have been things picked up by someone in our family in the last few years.)<br/>
 <br/>
One of the big problems we had was the schooled friends. They&#39;d tell Cameron he was going to be stupid, never get a job, etc. But Cam was 12. By 16, most of her friends already know how lame high school IS, so they probably won&#39;t bother her as much.<br/>
 <br/>
Attend a conference---either the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference (2006 in Albuquerque, NM) or a local/regional conference that&#39;s nearby. These are GREAT for you, your husband, and your daughter! Life-changing!<br/>
 <br/>
Not Back to School Camp---two on the west coast (OR) and one on the east (VT). Going to NBTSC would put her in touch with unschoolers from around the country. They are invaluable for the contacts and for knowing she&#39;s not alone---that *many* people live this lifestyle and are incredibly unique and exciting and full of life. The friends Cameron made there this year are priceless! He went to the east coast camp, but wants to go to all THREE next year! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Mostly, just realizing that such a life is POSSIBLE can be eye-opening! <br/>

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
Kelly, LOVED your whole post...such good info and support from all of <br/>
you on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse the intrusion, as I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve even done an intro here <br/>
yet, but I just wanted to ask if the NBTSC has moved to Vermont?  I <br/>
thought the one on the east coast was in West Virginia, and my eldest <br/>
daughter (FINALLY old enough!) would love to go this year.  That would <br/>
be tough for us, though, if it&#39;s moved to VT.<br/>
<br/>
So, here goes my super-quick intro:  I&#39;m Jenn Parr, from Virginia, mom <br/>
to four girls.  We have wholeheartedly embraced our unschooling lives <br/>
just over the past 9-10 months (before that we unschooled &quot;in the <br/>
closet&quot; and had a few workbooks &quot;in progress&quot;, just in case anyone <br/>
asked, you know!).  We&#39;re (all of us) into music BIG time, Shelby (12) <br/>
is learning guitar, Tori (7) and Ashlyn (6) are learning piano.  <br/>
Outside of playing instruments, there is always music of some sort <br/>
coming from one of our rooms.  We listen to all kinds:  opera, Broadway <br/>
musicals, Phish, Rufus Wainwright, classical (Ashlyn&#39;s fave, usually), <br/>
punk, bluegrass, world music, classic rock, even country!! (though not <br/>
MY personal choice, Shelby and Tori like it)! ;-)  Other current <br/>
interests (and these can/will change at the drop of a hat) include:  <br/>
writing stories, reading the HP series, the Narnia series, cooking, <br/>
soccer, Bratz dolls, board games as well as PS2 (We Love Katamari!), <br/>
GameCube (Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, etc.), and GameBoy games, <br/>
Sculpey art, watercolors, raking leaves, playing with little sis (Lolo) <br/>
and our kitten, learning chess, cooking veggie recipes, watching <br/>
Arrested Development and Family Guy, reading from &quot;A Cartoon History of <br/>
the World&quot;, drawing Manga, playing Neopets and Runescape online, etc., <br/>
etc., etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Both of my younger daughters (Ashlyn, 6 and Lolo, 3) have been <br/>
diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.  It was probably Ashlyn&#39;s <br/>
diagnosis that made me start reading more, questioning more about how <br/>
we &quot;teach&quot; our &quot;special needs&quot; children.  I couldn&#39;t imagine &quot;training&quot; <br/>
her to be &quot;normal&quot;...in my mommy eyes, she was already perfect, but all <br/>
the &quot;experts&quot; saw a child who needed to be fixed.  To be more normal.  <br/>
Yuck...what&#39;s so great about NORMAL, anyway?  ;-)  So, as her Mom, <br/>
I &quot;un-diagnosed&quot; her, so that she was just Ash, an amazingly bright, <br/>
with-it, funny, compassionate child who could do anything she set out <br/>
to do, but didn&#39;t HAVE to do anything she didn&#39;t want to do.  Our &quot;un-<br/>
diagnosis&quot; gradually led me to UNschooling (for the whole family), and <br/>
here we are today.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already learned so much reading here, and I hope to learn and grow <br/>
even more.  I recommend this list (plus a few others) to EVERYONE I <br/>
know who is embarking on this wondrous journey, and I look forward to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313896064">Welcome Jenn!  <br/>
  I just love how you said you &quot;un-diagnosed&quot; Ash....so very refreshing!  <br/>
  Oh, and Arrested Development...hubby just told me it was cancelled!  It&#39;s such a great show!<br/>
  <br/>
  I live in Tennesee on the Virginia border (Bristol) -- whereabouts are  you?  There are many of us here who don&#39;t live too far from you.<br/>

Kelly, LOVED your whole post...such good info and support from all of <br/>
you on this list.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Good! &lt;g&gt; Glad it helped!<br/>

Excuse the intrusion, as I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve even done an intro here <br/>
yet, but I just wanted to ask if the NBTSC has moved to Vermont?  I <br/>
thought the one on the east coast was in West Virginia, and my eldest <br/>
daughter (FINALLY old enough!) would love to go this year.  That would <br/>
be tough for us, though, if it&#39;s moved to VT.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
The West Virginia camp has been sold, plus they&#39;re looking for a &quot;greener&quot; camp---which they found in Vermont.<br/>
 <br/>
If it&#39;s a transportation problem, that can be worked out. The kids are always willing to pick up campers along the way!<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already learned so much reading here, and I hope to learn and grow <br/>
even more.  I recommend this list (plus a few others) to EVERYONE I <br/>
know who is embarking on this wondrous journey, and I look forward to <br/>
sharing more of our lives and our joys with you all.<br/>

 <br/>
Cool---thanks! <br/>
And welcome, Jen!<br/>
