<div id="ygrps-yiv-899022682">Welcome to the list Robin, I think you will find a lot of good reading here!<br/>
I have learned a ton, but more than that I don&#39;t feel so alone in my<br/>
journey.  When I do, I just plug into this group and I always feel very<br/>
supported in my decision to get the &quot;school&quot; out of learning!<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I do have a question.  Currently, Markus is reading Thomas<br/>
More&#39;s <br/>
Utopia. (His pick.) I started talking to him about literary <br/>
techniques More used - he wasn&#39;t uninterested, but not really <br/>
enthralled.  We&#39;ve talked a lot about Thomas More&#39;s life and he watch <br/>
A Man for All Seasons today, which he found very interesting with <br/>
regards to history and social stds.  My 1st inclination is to give <br/>
him some ideas to write about himself (he likes to write short <br/>
stories) - i.e. what would his own Utopia look like or how does <br/>
More&#39;s Utopia/England compare to modern America, etc.  As an <br/>
UNSCHOOLER, do you let them think of these things themselves or do <br/>
you offer the list and then let it be?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is nice to be offered information.  If the goal is to lay off the demands<br/>
and free up his life so that he can see for himself what he is interested<br/>
in, then making a suggestion is fine as long as you don&#39;t expect anything.<br/>
If you can&#39;t get to what you&#39;re interested in until all the demands are met,<br/>
there may be no joy or energy left...which is why (I think) you probably<br/>
took him out of school.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean he only finds things on<br/>
his own, you can inspire, and plant seeds by leaving things strewn about,<br/>
going to interesting places, and having experiences but then if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem interested, don&#39;t worry, and don&#39;t demand him to do anything with<br/>
it...I always ask myself when I&#39;m eager to chime in...am I thinking of<br/>
pushing my own agenda, or supporting his?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036294525">Thanks Andrea! I&#39;m very glad to have found this site.  Wherever we <br/>
discover we belong on the ladder, I&#39;ve always found it best to expose <br/>
myself to new perspectives.  I&#39;ve already read some things I find <br/>
rather surprising, but then after I let them settle with me, maybe <br/>
less so surprising. :)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes - one reason we pulled Markus out is because he comes up with <br/>
all these fascinating ideas and interests (less so the longer he was <br/>
in school!), but then doesn&#39;t seem to care to take them anywhere.  He <br/>
was SO stressed with all the petty demands the school put on him, I <br/>
believe he&#39;ll be more inclined to explore those interests once he&#39;s <br/>
had the chance to take a breath.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Robin</div>
