<div id="ygrps-yiv-160863540">Hi everyone - Just a reminder to trim your posts so the people on <br/>
digest don&#39;t have to wade through a lot of repeat information. <br/>
Thanks :0).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-664903065">There&#39;s a notice that goes out once a month about trimming posts, and JJ  said something in her post about it - I thought I&#39;d explain, for those who don&#39;t know, what trimming posts means!<br/>
<br/>
It means, when you reply to a specific message, to delete that original message from the bottom of your reply. You can cut & paste specific lines, if you think that&#39;s helpful. If you do that, please use -=- or ~~ or &lt;&lt;  around the original post&#39;s words, so it&#39;s very clear what YOU are saying. Use the return key to separate the original post from your reply.<br/>
<br/>
Trimming posts isn&#39;t so much an issue for me, I read the posts on the website, but for folks on digest, who get many posts in one email, it saves them from having to read the same post again and again and again, as people reply to it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
