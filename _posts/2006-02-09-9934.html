<br/>
It&#39;s cool. She definitely takes articles from a wide range of views<br/>
(for tv/against tv etc..) but they&#39;re all about UNschoolers. I really<br/>
love it!<br/>
I also love Life Learning magazine. Those two are my absolute favorite<br/>
magazines these days.  I really need to subscribe.<br/>

I TOTALLY second Ren&#39;s response!  I read both Live Free Learn Free and <br/>
Life Learning from cover to cover.  They are the best!<br/>
