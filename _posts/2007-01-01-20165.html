Danielle (14) is the WOW expert here, I&#39;ll ask her what she thinks.   <br/>
She plays in a guild of people she&#39;s connected with and uses a headset <br/>
to talk to them (much easier to plan and play as opposed to having to <br/>
type and read thoughts/instructions etc).   She just moved 2 high level <br/>
characters to a new guild so she wouldn&#39;t have to start from scratch <br/>
(it costs). <br/>
<br/>
She loves the horde and can&#39;t wait to get a blood elf!<br/>

schbang - but Ray&#39;s biggest interest is being able to connect with <br/>
others, and a chance to connect with unschoolers sounds really <br/>
exciting. What would we need to do to join? Should we email you off-<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been informed by the WoW expert of our house that this isn&#39;t<br/>
true. He says you need a charter and 25 silver, you can get a tabbard<br/>
but it isn&#39;t necessary. Also, you don&#39;t need to be lvl. 60. Sounds<br/>
pretty easy actually.<br/>
<br/>
He wants to wait for the expansion pack too, if he&#39;s going to play<br/>
with another guild. He&#39;s on Rexxar with a guild that raids every night<br/>
so it takes up a lot of his time and he&#39;s unsure about whether he can<br/>
do another guild or not. Let us know more.<br/>

My 12-year-old son, Liam, is an avid WoWer, too!  He&#39;s a level 46 <br/>
rogue in the Duskwood realm for the Horde.  He&#39;s excited about <br/>
joining the Guild!  He&#39;s hoping the guild will be in Duskwood so he <br/>
can use his lvl 46 character, whose name is &quot;RinkTen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He wonders, will this guild do a lot of instances?<br/>
<br/>
Liam came up with the name &quot;HordeRaiders&quot; as a suggestion.<br/>

Thanks for doing this!  It looks like it&#39;ll be a lot of fun!!<br/>

I, too, have a 14 yo who is what I would call &quot;addicted&quot; to WOW... <br/>
if nobody told him to stop he could easily play 16 hours a day, 7 <br/>
days a week, forgetting to eat, sleep, go to the bathroom...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a source of great angst for me, and has led me to be less <br/>
embracing of unschooling.  I just can&#39;t see the benefit of spending <br/>
so much time playing this game.  We have taken to limiting Aaron&#39;s <br/>
WOW time to evenings only, but I am feeling that we need to limit it <br/>
even more....  There are so many things that he formerly enjoyed <br/>
doing, that he doesn&#39;t even think to do anymore---it truly feels <br/>
like a classic addiction to me.  It makes me really sad... it&#39;s a <br/>
real problem around here.  I would also welcome any feedback... <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I did tell him about the new WOW group that <br/>
Adli&#39;s family is trying to form---I do like the idea that he would <br/>
be playing with a group of people who at least have something real <br/>
in common.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704698860">Limits.......Well my 7 year old likes to watch daddy mainly and isnt actually playing . She has chosenn to go to school this year and I do require her to adhere to the attendance requirements or withdraw from school totaly so obviously she cant play during school hours. <br/>
  This is the same for any game she likes to play. <br/>
  We also have 4 people sharing 2 computers and one of which daddy has to use 40 hours a week for work . So I ask that she respect other peoples need for the computer but I never give an arbitrary 2 hour or whatever limit. <br/>
   <br/>
  Just my 2 cents ,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-27864062">I&#39;ve spent the last two days playing WoW and have been having a blast. I&#39;ve <br/>
done it before, I have a couple of level 14 characters scattered around as I <br/>
seem to fizzle out &#39;round there. Simon and Linnaea play occasionally, <br/>
Linnaea more than Simon as she&#39;ll call a friend and they&#39;ll play together <br/>
and talk about what they are doing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, that&#39;s my life according to WoW. But I know a bit of the game. It is <br/>
an amazingly complicated game with so much going on that it is easy to sit <br/>
down and spend a day or two days or a week moving through quest after quest, <br/>
finding the perfect armor for your character, mastering the art of herbalism <br/>
and potion making, perfecting your polymorphism, learning how to blacksmith <br/>
or mine. And there is so much communication and so much helpfulness. If I&#39;m <br/>
getting bested by some monster or another, running in the direction of some <br/>
other player is likely to get me help. And I&#39;m likely to help someone else <br/>
as well. It is a fantastically altruistic world.<br/>
<br/>
Play it before you limit your son. Sit down with him and have him help you <br/>
create a character and help you move through the tutorial level quests to <br/>
get your character to a likeable point. I like the orcs, they are so <br/>
Rastafarian. There&#39;s been a recent discussion about WoW at <br/>
unschoolingdiscussion. If you want to read it: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion/browse_thread/thread/c82284b55aac1242/099eda5ec174f122?hl=en#099eda5ec174f122">http://groups.google.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion/browse_thread/thread/c82284b55aac1242/099eda5ec174f122?hl=en#099eda5ec174f122</a><br/>
I think the list may be accessible without membership.<br/>
<br/>
But really, don&#39;t limit your son without knowing why he might love it so. Is <br/>
limiting it helping him to really love other things? Or is he increasingly <br/>
anxious to get home to play the little bits of time he&#39;s being allowed? Is <br/>
it helping your relationship with him to talk in degrading terms about the <br/>
thing that he loves? Maybe if you embraced  WoW with him not only would you <br/>
come to find value in it but, since it isn&#39;t something that he&#39;ll have to <br/>
leave, his interest in other things might return. If you move some activity <br/>
that could be joyful and interesting to the land of addiction than your son <br/>
might just embrace it as if it were an addiction. Because you hate it, and I <br/>
am sure he knows that, there may be a sense that it is a limited time offer <br/>
and he may be treating it as such. But he may not be. It isn&#39;t a limited <br/>
time deal for me, and I&#39;ve really spent the last couple of days playing <br/>
pretty much all day. It is a lovely way to spend time.<br/>

&gt; WOW?  Right now, I&#39;ve got mine on 2 hours a day, but he is begging<br/>

&gt; Hi Deb,<br/>
&gt; I, too, have a 14 yo who is what I would call &quot;addicted&quot; to WOW...<br/>
&gt; if nobody told him to stop he could easily play 16 hours a day, 7<br/>
&gt; days a week, forgetting to eat, sleep, go to the bathroom...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a source of great angst for me, and has led me to be less<br/>
&gt; embracing of unschooling.  I just can&#39;t see the benefit of spending<br/>
&gt; so much time playing this game.  We have taken to limiting Aaron&#39;s<br/>
&gt; WOW time to evenings only, but I am feeling that we need to limit it<br/>
&gt; even more....  There are so many things that he formerly enjoyed<br/>
&gt; doing, that he doesn&#39;t even think to do anymore---it truly feels<br/>
&gt; like a classic addiction to me.  It makes me really sad... it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; real problem around here.  I would also welcome any feedback...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the other hand, I did tell him about the new WOW group that<br/>
&gt; Adli&#39;s family is trying to form---I do like the idea that he would<br/>
&gt; be playing with a group of people who at least have something real<br/>
&gt; in common.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386770285">I have been battling the addiction in an intense way for a few weeks now.

WOW has a parental control feature and I threatened to use it if he could not control his playing time on his own. I was going to limit him to not playing past midnight, not playing until late afternoons, with a 2 hour break for dinner and seeing how that went.<br/>
However, I would rather the decision came from him.<br/>
<br/>
So after the &quot;talk&quot; he was willing to play less.  But don&#39;t know how long it will last.... <br/>
I actually created a character and played with him.  I agree it is fun and I definately agree that learning takes place.  But 13 hours a day is a lack of balance. <br/>
I hope he can come up with his own solution; I would really regret having to impose limits.<br/>

I find that if I talk with Danielle about things that I&#39;d like her <br/>
help with, or things that SHE has asked me to remind her about <br/>
(because she loses track of time then remembers at bedtime!) is to <br/>
pop in and ask her when would be a good time to do &quot;whatever&quot; it is, <br/>
as opposed to demanding.   That way she has control and input into <br/>
when, because, it IS hard to change gears (and I DO understand about <br/>
the raids etc they get involved in as a group on WOW).   Even when <br/>
she plans to take a shower, I have to help her by reminding her <br/>
several times, even with a quick, gentle comment as I walk by &quot;shower <br/>
tonight?&quot;  or &quot;shower?&quot;.   I find if I work with her on planning <br/>
she&#39;s more willing.   <br/>
<br/>
Each family does it differently, and when you&#39;re really new to <br/>
unschooling, it&#39;s a real paradigm shift when you&#39;re used to insisting <br/>
on chores etc etc and we each have to find what works for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835955027">Good Afternoon All,<br/>
<br/>
I joined this list a short time ago and have been lurking and thoroughly enjoying reading the posts here as I contemplate homeschooling/unschooling. I am tending more towards unschooling but my husband is dragging his feet a little. At the moment here (we live in Australia) it is Christmas holiday period with the schools so he is relaxed and I am taking every opportunity to point out when they learn something or improve a skill so he can begin to see it.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to comment on the current discussion of whether or not to set limits on gaming. I am personally inclined to say that there SHOULD be limits. In my experience, if there are no limits then when does the gamer do anything else? My brother (will be 25 in April) started gaming (I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s WoW or something similar) when he was waiting for major surgery on his knee. He had dropped out of school due to medical reasons (I say dropped out because he had intended to stay there). It is now almost 3 years since the operation and he is still an avid gamer. So much so that it literally runs his life. The people who he games with are largely based in the USA so he has essentially become nocturnal. My brother has no income and lives with my Dad who is on a pension. He eats poorly as making mac and cheese or a microwaved burger takes up less of his gaming time. My brother has no intention of getting a job, no motivation to do so when his time is so filled with enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
The game has literally become his life; or vice versa, I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t think that that is something that should be encouraged and I don&#39;t know how you could discourage it without setting limits on gaming time, or mandatory requirements that other things be done before the gaming begins for the day, etc.<br/>

<br/>
Too funny.  I was just talking to Dave last night and joking that he was <br/>
addicted to WoW. Now that I here about other families playing 16 <br/>
hours...well, maybe he&#39;s not.  heehee<br/>
<br/>
The other day Sorscha was playing at home and she was asking me how to spell <br/>
a bunch of what I would call &#39;big&#39; battling words.  I knew that obviously <br/>
she was talking with someone and I really wanted to come look over her <br/>
shoulder to &#39;make sure all was safe&#39;.  Instead I chose to trust her in the <br/>
situation and I remained silent and did not let my panties get in a bunch <br/>
worrying about some big, bad person that I created in my head saying <br/>
something innappropriate.<br/>
<br/>
After about 20 minutes I finally asked her, &quot;Hey, cool you made a friend on <br/>
there.&quot; Okay, so I finally opened my big mouth but my panties were creeping <br/>
up just slightly. heehee<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, Sorscha then said to me, &quot;Oh it&#39;s just Dad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YUP, I felt like a total idiot.  The interesting thing is that Sorscha has <br/>
chosen to be this big male guy with armor and such and she&#39;s getting really <br/>
great at the game.  No one would ever guess they were working with a 9 year <br/>
old girl.  heehee<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-91868283">Hi,<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this helps any, but my stepson was<br/>
&#39;addicted&#39; to WOW too when we took him out of public<br/>
school in the middle of seventh grade. He played most<br/>
days all days without doing much of anything else for<br/>
about a year. He did not even want to see his friends<br/>
anymore or go out anywhere. Drove his father crazy,<br/>
but I knew he was just deschooling and had a lot of<br/>
healing to do. Computer games are great for that I<br/>
hear, even have been studies done on that. In<br/>
hindsight he said that was the best year of his life.<br/>
Now he is barely on the computer and does a lot of<br/>
things self-initiated and with lots of friends (he<br/>
recently started Sudbury Valley and would now be in<br/>
10th grade).<br/>
I believe he learned a lot in that year, the family<br/>
relationships improved greatly and he changed from<br/>
often being angry, sick and unhappy to a wonderful,<br/>
confident young man who loves the outdoors and many<br/>
other things completely unrelated to computer games.<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Mara<br/>

We&#39;re still waiting for our WoW, but Ray plays other games. The only <br/>
limits we have are the &quot;natural&quot; limits of one computer shared <br/>
between four people - and dial-up at that, so there are times when <br/>
the phone lines need to be free for awhile. <br/>
<br/>
One of our solutions has been to ask him to stay up later and play <br/>
more at night. He was a little startled by the request &quot;y&#39;all *want* <br/>
me to stay up late Playing on the computer? Really&quot; Its so totally <br/>
the opposite of the expectations from when he was in school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m expecting WoW to take over the whole family for at least a <br/>
little while, but that&#39;s one reason I wanted to get it Right Now! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-722503226">Hi Randi,<br/>
<br/>
First off, you need to buy a copy of the game for each member of the <br/>
family who will want to be playing.<br/>
This isn&#39;t completely necessary, but only one person can be logged into <br/>
an account at any time, so the<br/>
more copies you buy, the more accounts you can make (each copy comes <br/>
with one CD-Key, and each CD-Key can be used ONCE to make ONE account) <br/>
and the more members of the family that can play at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
The first WoW expansion pack, The Burning Crusade, will be released <br/>
mid-January. Buying this EXP is NOT<br/>
something that you have to do, though I highly recommend it. People with <br/>
the expansion pack will be able to<br/>
access brand new areas of the game, and play as the two new races being <br/>
implemented into the game, as well<br/>
as experience various other new features. If you don&#39;t have the EXP, you <br/>
won&#39;t be able to participate with these<br/>
new areas of the game with friends. If you decide to buy the EXP, you <br/>
will need to buy one copy for every<br/>
WoW account you own in order to upgrade each account to &quot;Burning Crusade <br/>
status.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that each account costs around $15 every month to keep <br/>
playing, though you can freeze the account at any time, keeping all your <br/>
characters and work but no longer paying or playing, so you can start<br/>
up again at any time you want without having to start from scratch.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, let me know.<br/>

&gt; _www.worldofwarcraft.com_ (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com)  if you<br/>
go  there, <br/>
&gt; there is a 10 day free trial (which includes the full version of <br/>
WOW).  <br/>
&gt; There are some restrictions however with the free trial, you can <br/>
only level to <br/>
&gt; 20.  You cannot trade items with other members, and you cant  do<br/>
general chat.  <br/>
&gt; But to just get a feel for the game, and if you and your  kids will<br/>
like it or <br/>
&gt; not it&#39;s a great way to check it out without  buying.<br/>

&gt; Hi  all...my name is Randi and I am just a part of our wonderful<br/>
unschooling  <br/>
&gt; family in Albuquerque and we are thinking about starting WoW but<br/>
have no idea <br/>
&gt;  where to start. Do we have to buy the base game and all the<br/>
expansions? <br/>
&gt; Could  someone please give me the basics? I think that this could be<br/>
a real blast <br/>
&gt; for  me and my brothers. Thanks for all your help!<br/>

&gt; &quot;All that  is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people  do<br/>

&gt; &quot; Knowledge is power but how you use that power defines  wether you<br/>

When something else becomes more valuble. <br/>
<br/>
Its hard to extrapolate the experiences of an adult who was in school <br/>
until his twenties to a kid, even a teen, who has received the gift of <br/>
Trust that is unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Spend more time reading about the lives of unschoolers and get a sense <br/>
of the different experiences that are out there. Limits and rules <br/>
aren&#39;t the only options - aren&#39;t necessarily the best options. <br/>
