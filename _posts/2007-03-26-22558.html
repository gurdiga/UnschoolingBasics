<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358462316">My boys have access to all 3 devices.  They are all learning tools in<br/>
the same fashion as books.<br/>
<br/>
Daniel(15) will watch HOW ITS MADE all day long if it came on....He<br/>
loves shows like MYTH BUSTERS, the how to survive the wilderness show,<br/>
not sure of the name, WORLDS MOST..... anything.....lol, GUINESS BOOK<br/>
OF WORLD RECORDS show...how to build this...how to build<br/>
that......shows...he even watches THE TAKE HOME CHEF twice a day! lol.<br/>
<br/>
Matthew(10) could not live without ASK JEEVES......he has researched<br/>
so many things on his own.....the coolest thing was a PREHISTORIC<br/>
BAT...you should have seen the teeth on that thing!!!! SCARY!<br/>
<br/>
As for video games.....I am not fond of them, however, they know just<br/>
about everything there is to know about skateboarding, bike racing,<br/>
snowboarding, auto racing,  what to add to a car to give it more<br/>
horsepower and torque, BIOGRAPHIES of famous motorcross riders,<br/>
snowboarders, skateboarders...both past and present...and most of<br/>
their stats.  We get 4 different dirtbikes magazines, NASCAR<br/>
magazines, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC magazines, U.S. NEWSWEEK magazines, and<br/>
ARTIST magazines.<br/>
<br/>
How could this NOT be learning........<br/>
