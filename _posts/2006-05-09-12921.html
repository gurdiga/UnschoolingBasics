<div id="ygrps-yiv-140666412">My 2.5 yo dd is a very aggressive hitter.  I&#39;ve been dealing with <br/>
the issue of hitting with her for over a year now, and I can&#39;t seem <br/>
to get her to stop.  Mainly she hits her friends her own age, <br/>
usually boys, maybe b/c that&#39;s what our playgroup is mostly <br/>
comprised of, and she hits her daddy often, and at times me.  Though <br/>
I know they say children don&#39;t do things to be manipulative, she <br/>
definitely seems to do it malisciously.  I&#39;ve even had friends tell <br/>
me how &quot;unique&quot; my dd&#39;s behavor is as they&#39;ve seen more and more <br/>
interaction among toddlers/preschoolers.  They say they&#39;ve never <br/>
seen anyone her age be so vindictive.  I&#39;ve tried just about <br/>
everything I can think of and can&#39;t get her to stop.  This will <br/>
probably be a long post, b/c I want to give you as much information <br/>
on our situation as possible, and maybe somewhat disjointed.  Sorry, <br/>
hope you can follow my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
***First of all let me give you some examples of her &quot;aggressive <br/>
behaviour&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday at a LLL meeting she found a stick and started poking the <br/>
two boys she&#39;d been playing with, ages 3 & 4.  I didn&#39;t know she was <br/>
doing this until she&#39;d done it a couple of times.  At one point she <br/>
poked one little boy in the ear and hurt him.  The family is one we <br/>
know and have been around several times, so the mother reprimanded <br/>
dd without hesitation.  My daughter didn&#39;t seemed phased.  After a <br/>
few minutes the mother and child left for the bathroom or something <br/>
as they were leaving the son went up to dd and said &quot;don&#39;t poke me <br/>
with the stick Rachel&quot; and then left.  Rachel immediately turned to <br/>
the other boy she&#39;d poked earlier, the 4yo, and tried to hit him.<br/>
<br/>
Last night she had a nighttime snack before she went to bed, she <br/>
chose honey dew.  We took her into the bathroom to clean her up, <br/>
like always.  When it came time to brush her teeth my husband picked <br/>
her up, she&#39;s lost interest in doing it herself and declined it <br/>
again, and she slapped him across the face.  We put her in time <br/>
out.  Afterwards we went back to the bathroom only to have the <br/>
scenario repeat.  Time outs are about the only thing I&#39;ve read to do <br/>
in situations of aggressive behaviour.  I will get more into that <br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
This morning she asked for her best friend to come over and play, <br/>
he&#39;d been gone for a week and we haven&#39;t seen him.  Once he came <br/>
over they played for about 10-15 minutes before she started becoming <br/>
aggressive... pulling on him, pushing him, kicking.  Finally we had <br/>
to attend the playdate after less than half an hour b/c Rachel <br/>
slapped him across the face (her preferred thing to do) when he sat <br/>
in a chair that she apparently didn&#39;t want him sitting in, even <br/>
though she never seems to use it herself.  <br/>
<br/>
On another instance she was nursing and started twirling my hair I <br/>
told her she was pulling it and it was hurting me to please stop.  <br/>
She took hold of my hair and yanked as hard as she could.  This has <br/>
happened more than once.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband plays with her if he lays down or does something she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want her to do she throws things at him.<br/>
<br/>
**Reasons I think why this may be happening.<br/>
Let me say first that I do not believe this is a communication <br/>
thing.  DD is very bright for her age her language is about a year <br/>
ahead of her age.  She has never had problems being able to <br/>
communicate, adn has never had temper tantrums like those I&#39;ve seen <br/>
or heard of kids doing out of frustration from not being able to <br/>
communicate.  <br/>
<br/>
This behaviour seems to be on a roller coaster trend.  She may go <br/>
weeks without any serious problems, except with dad, then have a <br/>
couple of weeks with nothing but problems.<br/>
<br/>
At one time I suspected that she was doing it when she was feeling <br/>
abandonment.  Dad&#39;s been gone to work so she let&#39;s him know her <br/>
disproval by hitting and throwing things at him.  She hasn&#39;t seen <br/>
her friends so she aggressive toward them when she does.  But, that <br/>
didn&#39;t seem to follow the pattern, except maybe with dh.  When it <br/>
comes to kids, she often picks on whom she deems the &quot;weakest&quot;.  <br/>
Maybe the youngest in the group, the one with the least verbal <br/>
skilss, the one with the least agility, the clingy one, etc.  Again <br/>
I find it interesting that I don&#39;t seem to see her pick on girls as <br/>
much, but as I said mainly plays with boys.  Most of the girls in <br/>
our group have WAHMs so most of the playdates she is the only girl.  <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed she doesn&#39;t seem to have problems in our unschooling <br/>
group were the kids are all older than her, also contains more <br/>
girls.  <br/>
<br/>
Like most children the lows on the roller coaster especially occur <br/>
during times when she&#39;s tired or hungry.  This week has been <br/>
especially bad, and dh thinks maybe she&#39;s not feeling well.  He&#39;s <br/>
had really bad allergies this week, and he thinks maybe she has as <br/>
well.  She&#39;s rarely sick, I think only twice in 2 1/2 yrs so she <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a lot of experience in communicating when her body <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel well.  I&#39;ve noticed this week as well that she&#39;s been <br/>
much more, disobedient for lack of a better word.  She&#39;s dumping out <br/>
things onto the floor and doing other things she hasn&#39;t done in <br/>
several months and knows is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
***Books I&#39;ve read...<br/>
Since this trend began at about 14 mo or so I&#39;ve read any book I <br/>
could about discipline.  I&#39;ve read<br/>
-Dr. Sears discipline book<br/>
- LLL Without Spanking or Spoiling<br/>
-Harvey Karp&#39;s Happies Toddler (not helpful I found)<br/>
-Love and Logic for Preschooler<br/>
-Don&#39;t shoot the dog (a book our local API leader gave me about <br/>
behavor training.)<br/>
-(I&#39;ve even read the What to Expect book) As well as a non-approved <br/>
LLL about 2 and 3 yo.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read Alfie Kohn, I just recently heard about him, and <br/>
have &quot;unconditionaly love&quot; on reserve at the library wants it is <br/>
returned.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like the primary example as a problem in most of these <br/>
books is cleaning up toys.  I could give a rats ass about that, I <br/>
just want my dd to stop hitting!<br/>
<br/>
***Methods we&#39;ve tried..<br/>
As I think I mentioned earlier it seems that most of the books talk <br/>
about Time outs, which we&#39;re finding not to be very effective, and <br/>
I&#39;m beginning to feel they&#39;re too punitive.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve tried giving her words or alternative things she could do in <br/>
different situations. Expressing herself using words, walking away, <br/>
playing something else, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve said things like, hitting isn&#39;t how we touch someone, this is <br/>
how, and took her hand showed her.<br/>
<br/>
We leave her have friends leave when she begins to get aggressive.  <br/>
Saying we can&#39;t stay if we&#39;re hurting others.  This doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>
be effective.  She doesn&#39;t really seem to care about having <br/>
friends.  She asks occassionally for her best friend but other than <br/>
that she could care less.  (My DH is kind of the same way)<br/>
It alludes me what else we&#39;ve tried, but if I think of it I&#39;ll add <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned this problem several months back at a LLL toddler <br/>
meeting and every suggestion was something we&#39;d tried.  The final <br/>
conclusion was that she just need to grow out of it.  But I can&#39;t <br/>
wait for her to grow out of it any longer.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of the cause this behavior needs to stop.  She needs to <br/>
learn that even if she&#39;s tired or hungry, hitting and other <br/>
aggressive acts are never ok.  Help please.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-909456966">quick question...if she doesn&#39;t have friends or prefer to be with  <br/>
friends, then who are these kids at the playgroup? It seems to me  <br/>
that if you&#39;ve said that hitting will help you get out of situations  <br/>
(playgroup, brushing teeth) by getting time out, she nows now how to  <br/>
get out of things that she doesn&#39;t have a say in. Other&#39;s, i&#39;m sure,  <br/>
will have wise words, I don&#39;t. I do have a child that hits, she&#39;s  <br/>
almost nine and has severe autism. She hits because the school taught  <br/>
her that hitting gets her out of stuff. They forced her to do stuff  <br/>
she wasn&#39;t ready for, and hitting was the only way to get out. Then  <br/>
suddenly she gets this great time out, away from the problem and LOTS  <br/>
Of attention. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s good or not.<br/>
<br/>
We stay with her. All the time. Other kids have the right to not be  <br/>
hurt. We physically stop her from hurting people. She does have a  <br/>
communication problem, but us holding her hand is a pretty good sign  <br/>
that we are not allowing her to continue the swing. We try to respect  <br/>
her needs. If she doesn&#39;t want to go to the library, or the park, or  <br/>
whatever, we find ways around that. We make sure she has something  <br/>
she likes to do. We thank her with some frenchfries when we leave a  <br/>
playgroup she didn&#39;t want to be at.<br/>
<br/>
DOn&#39;t know that I&#39;&#39;ve said anything helpful, and I&#39;m typing while  <br/>
nursing, so I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some spelling issues, but lmk about the  <br/>
friend thing<br/>

I&#39;ve noticed that a many 2.5 year olds are not ready<br/>

with older kids/adults. You might want to consider<br/>
dropping the playgroups for a while. <br/>

about knowing language. It involves knowing yourself<br/>
well enough to know what&#39;s bugging you and then<br/>
finding the words to describe that. I have trouble<br/>
with that at the ripe old age of 41.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992679780">I don&#39;t agree with the idea that the 2 year old is vindictive.  Don&#39;t let <br/>
others plant that kind of seed in your head about your child.  I have a 2.5 year <br/>
old, I baby sit another 2.5 year old and I just let go of a 2.5 year old <br/>
foster baby. These three all hit when they get frustrated or mistreated.  It&#39;s <br/>
normal, for both sexes. I would say my oldest daughter (now 9) was never a hitter <br/>
but I may have forgotten which is a good sign.  It a temporary phase.<br/>
<br/>
This too shall pass so try not to let others label your child a manipulative, <br/>
vindictive hitter.  If you have to warn another mom about her hitting and <br/>
your daughter is within hearing distance I would say something to the effect of:  <br/>
&#39;She&#39;s been trying out hitting and is still learning how much it hurts.&#39;  <br/>
That way everyone can keep a close eye on the little ones and intervene if they <br/>
see frustration building or any potential hitting triggers.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and be glad she isn&#39;t biting.  Tell those other moms that 2.5 year <br/>
olds aren&#39;t supposed to know how to handle their emotions so not to expect <br/>
your &quot;baby&quot; to be able to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060909831">I think it would probably be very helpful for you to be very involved <br/>
or at least be very close by whenever she is with other kids.  That <br/>
way, you can see potential triggers and head them off with <br/>
distraction and other things before she gets to hitting.<br/>
<br/>
Also, ask yourself is she could be hungry or have low blood sugar <br/>
when these things happen.  Sometimes a healthy snack is all a kid <br/>
needs to feel right.<br/>
<br/>
I agree very much with the writer who said to be careful about <br/>
labeling your daughter &quot;vindictive,&quot; etc.  Even though she&#39;s <br/>
&quot;advanced&quot; in her communication skills, I still think this probably <br/>
falls under that heading.  Really, everything is about <br/>
communication!  She&#39;s trying to tell you something, and she either <br/>
hasn&#39;t found words for it, or she has found that this aggressive <br/>
behavior has served her better than being verbal has (it gets your <br/>
attention or whatever other payoff she&#39;s seeking**).  It may be that <br/>
she wants you to be more involved when there are other kids around or <br/>
that she wants to have more of a say in what happens to her next (for <br/>
example, brushing teeth).<br/>
<br/>
Whatever it is, try to banish the idea that malice is her motivation, <br/>
even though that&#39;s what it looks like to you.  Sheer malice is <br/>
rarely  (if ever) a kid&#39;s M.O.  When kids don&#39;t feel right, they <br/>
don&#39;t behave right.  Something is not sitting well with her, and your <br/>
job is to find out what it is and help her.  To this end, the more <br/>
you can see yourself as her partner or helper, the better you will be <br/>
able to move past this thing and get to another place with her, and <br/>
the extra benefit is continually improving the level of trust between you.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t read it already, consider checking out &quot;How to Talk So <br/>
Kids Will Listen, and Listen So Kids Will Talk.&quot;  It&#39;s really helpful <br/>
in the communication area, and it&#39;s great in helping people move away <br/>
from the crime-punishment cycle (like time-outs) that parents and <br/>
children can get trapped in.  One of the last chapters is an <br/>
excellent piece on labeling, and the whole book is worth it for that <br/>
chapter alone, in my opinion!<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps!!<br/>

<br/>
** P.S.  Still, I would not see that as being manipulative for <br/>
manipulation&#39;s sake any more than I would see talking or writing a <br/>
letter as being manipulative for manipulation&#39;s sake -- it&#39;s strictly <br/>
communication.  If she has discovered that smacking her friend in the <br/>
face is the most effective way of getting her point across, well, <br/>
that&#39;s what any reasonable person would do:  the most expeditious <br/>
method is the one we go for.  That&#39;s pretty intelligent, <br/>
really.  Your job is to help her find a truly better way!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858981227">This is a partial discussion from about a year ago.<br/>
I took out the names of the other moms.<br/>
I wasn&#39;t sure how to get their permission to repost...<br/>
<br/>
Short answer for the hitting:<br/>
Tell her how you DO want to be treated.<br/>
&quot;Daddy is not for hitting, if you are angry, you can say &quot;Daddy, I&#39;m <br/>
mad&quot; or you can stomp your feet or hit this pillow, etc. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hitting hurts, you can say &quot;no thank you&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not ready yet&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When the scene is over, brainstorm for solutions WITH her. &quot;We don&#39;t <br/>
like being hit, what do you think we could do instead when you get <br/>
mad?&quot; Come up with tons of ideas. Try them out! Counting out loud <br/>
and slow breathing sometimes helps, a hug sometimes helps, maybe <br/>
a &quot;secret&quot; signal that lightens things up- I used to tickle Jacob&#39;s <br/>
palm. Now, I will often try to infuse things with humor. Get away <br/>
from the scene. Be active. Play with dough. Draw wildly with crayons <br/>
or &quot;stab&quot; the paper. Get a snack. Physically intervene, though, not <br/>
only to protect the other person, but to facilitate moving toward <br/>
something else.<br/>
<br/>
The book I am recommending is also against time-outs and goes into <br/>
why they are not helpful and can actually make things worse.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Emile,<br/>
I used to recommend those 2...<br/>
I thought they were a good starting point because they focused on<br/>
seeing things from your child&#39;s point of view.<br/>
I learned a lot of language that was more respectful and over time,<br/>
it did become second nature to treat my children with more respect.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t just words!<br/>
<br/>
I have gone on to read other books that I find more useful in terms<br/>
of unschooling, but I still think that they were a good place for me<br/>
to start.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of recommendations, I second all the Kohn, Holt, and Gatto<br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
I have recently read another book which has given me more<br/>
perspective and more specific tools for my OWN behavior. It is<br/>
written with the idea that we can&#39;t teach that which we do not know.<br/>
It is called &quot;Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline&quot; by Becky Bailey.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t agree with everything she has to say, but the skills and<br/>
change in mindset are top notch.<br/>

Kiersten<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------<br/>
I was going to suggest the Becky Bailey book Easy to Love, Difficult <br/>
to<br/>
Discipline as well. One idea from her that we have really integrated <br/>
is<br/>
that of attributing a positive intention to a child&#39;s behavior even <br/>
if<br/>
the behavior is problematic, and expressing that to the child. So, <br/>
for<br/>
instance, if my older son grabs a toy away from my toddler, saying,<br/>
&quot;You wanted to make sure you got to play with that toy as much as you<br/>
wanted to,&quot; or if he grabs a cookie off somebody else&#39;s plate, &quot;wow,<br/>
you are really enjoying those cookies!&quot; You can go on from there with<br/>
whatever &quot;discipline&quot; or problem-solving approach feels right to<br/>
you--we usually focus on alternative strategies for getting that need<br/>
met--but taking the attitude that there is some positive and<br/>
appropriate motivation behind the behavior is good for the parent and<br/>
the child as well. (Think about what a different message that sends<br/>
than an implicit or explicit characterization of the child <br/>
as &quot;greedy&quot;<br/>
or &quot;grabby&quot; or &quot;selfish.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We also like Bailey&#39;s assertion, as Kiersten mentioned, that you <br/>
can&#39;t<br/>
teach what you don&#39;t know--another way to think about it is that you<br/>
can&#39;t expect a child to rise to standards of behavior you don&#39;t meet<br/>
for yourself. Bailey would say, you have to discipline yourself <br/>
first.<br/>
This has helped my partner and me in looking at our own behaviors, <br/>
and<br/>
in developing expectations of behaviors and treatments that really<br/>
apply to the whole family, not with one (higher) standard for kids <br/>
and<br/>
another one for adults.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------<br/>
I agree that a great deal of the material (as well as the title) is<br/>
not ideal for unschooling. The title, in fact, doesn&#39;t seem to fit<br/>
the book at all and probably hurts her sales.<br/>
<br/>
As background- I found the book being discussed on<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gentlechristianmothers.com/">http://www.gentlechristianmothers.com/</a> when looking for advice for a<br/>
Dobson follower. She was only willing to read Christian authors. I<br/>
was not looking to &quot;discipline&quot; my kids. I was, however, intrigued<br/>
by the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should list more specifics about why I DID like the book.<br/>
Some of these ideas may sound obvious to you, but it came as a shock<br/>
to me to hear things spelled out so simply. The family environment I<br/>
was raised in did nothing to help me learn these skills...<br/>
<br/>
These are the 7 &quot;attitude shifts&quot; she discusses and what I thought<br/>
about them.<br/>
<br/>
Attitude shift 1: Harnessing the Power of Perception  (no one can<br/>
make you angry without your permission)<br/>
Reason: to own your own upset<br/>
<br/>
Notice how your thoughts create your feelings. when you feel angry,<br/>
overwhelmed or anxious, check to see what you are thinking, where is<br/>
your mind directed?<br/>
How often do you use blaming language (You are making me so _____)?<br/>
When you blame others, you are giving up your control (of yourself).<br/>
<br/>
I caught myself using blaming language more often than I expected<br/>
and have been working hard to own my feelings and accept them.<br/>
Strangely, I could accept my kids having big feelings, but was<br/>
punishing myself whenever I got overwhelmed by similar emotions.<br/>
<br/>
Attitude Shift 2: Harnessing the Power of Attention<br/>
Reason: what you focus on you get more of<br/>
<br/>
Pay Attention to your focus. Are you focusing on what you want or on<br/>
what you dont want?&quot; When you are upset, it is almost always because<br/>
you are focusing on what you DO NOT want!<br/>
<br/>
I am constantly trying to frame things in terms of what I DO want<br/>
now. I hadn&#39;t realized how often I said &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t know<br/>
how&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t want this&quot;, etc. I was priming myself to feel BAD. It<br/>
is hard for me sometimes to even come up with a positive statement<br/>
when I am getting overwhelmed. I am working so hard to pay attention<br/>
and make this change. It does work. Changing what I focus on is<br/>
changing my attitude and my actions. I feel like I can set a more<br/>
positive example for my kids now.<br/>
<br/>
Attitude Shift 3: Harnessing the Power of Free Will<br/>
Reason: The only person you can make change is yourself<br/>
<br/>
Change your &quot;shoulds&quot; to &quot;coulds&quot;; Then make a choice and live with<br/>
it. Instead of saying I &quot;should&quot; go to the store or I &quot;should&quot; write<br/>
those thank-you cards, say I &quot;could&quot; do _______, and then choose. It<br/>
is free will. YOU have the right to choose what to do.<br/>
Allow others to have their own thoughts and feelings. Pay attention<br/>
to what you feel when people disagree with you. (Most of us feel<br/>
threatened).<br/>
<br/>
I lived in a world of &quot;shoulds&quot;- guilt self-imposed that I put at<br/>
the feet of my mother or grandmother. I willingly felt bad for not<br/>
doing what &quot;they&quot; wanted. I feel so much more powerful and in<br/>
control since I have been owning my actions. Many times I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
complete a task because it became this huge albatross of obligation<br/>
and sucked away any of my desire to do it. I have felt more<br/>
independent and strong since I have been choosing my actions instead<br/>
of trying to make other people happy at my own expense.<br/>
<br/>
Attitude Shift 4: Harnessing the Power of unity<br/>
Reason: to focus on connecting instead of trying to be special<br/>
<br/>
Take five minutes or more, daily and &quot;just be&quot; with each of your<br/>
children. Put aside any agenda, and simply enjoy their company.<br/>
<br/>
This one wasn&#39;t too powerful for me, but I am with them almost 24/7,<br/>
so 5 minutes sounds ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
Attitude Shift 5: Harnessing the Power of Love<br/>
Reason: to see the best in one another<br/>
<br/>
Wish People Well. Do this silently from your heart when you are<br/>
standing in lines, driving, or passing people as you walk. Give this<br/>
gift to everyone you see. Notice how you feel when you do this.<br/>
Begin each day being grateful for at least three things. Before you<br/>
go to bed, tell all your family members how thankful you are for<br/>
their presence in your life. Notice what this does for your energy<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
This is where the idea of attributing the best possible intentions<br/>
to a child was covered. I think I do pretty well with this one.<br/>
<br/>
Attitude Shift 6: Harnessing the power of Acceptance<br/>
Reason: this moment is as it is<br/>
<br/>
This was a big one. She talked about not making blanket statements<br/>
like &quot;we don&#39;t hit in this house&quot; after someone has just hit. You<br/>
deny the present by making such statements. Accept what is, AS IT IS!<br/>
Make choices based on what IS.<br/>
<br/>
I often fall back on how things &quot;should&quot; be. I was raised in a very<br/>
punishment/reward centered home and learned that if I did A, then<br/>
B &quot;should&quot; happen. I have found myself dissapointed a great deal<br/>
when what I expected and wanted didn&#39;t happen. I am working on<br/>
accepting things as they are.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Practice being peaceful in the moment by noticing things and<br/>
describing what you see, without judgements. Notice the weather,<br/>
plants outdoors, shadows, smells and sounds.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Add a ritual to your childs bedtime routine that involves saying<br/>
goodnight to her body parts. for example, Im going to say goodnight<br/>
to your ears (touch the ears) your chin, elbows.....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This has helped me be more present and focus on just enjoying my<br/>
kids and making up our own special time at night instead of focusing<br/>
on trying to get them to sleep as fast as possible. As a side<br/>
benefit, we are all happier and they do fall asleep more easily. (I<br/>
am sure they felt my fatigue and desire for them to sleep before and<br/>
I was probably noticibly &quot;going through the motions&quot; My kids are 2<br/>
and 3 1/2, so I do help them wind down at night (when they are ready)<br/>
<br/>
Attitude Shift 7: Harnessing the Power of Attention<br/>
Reason: Conflict offers an opportunity to teach<br/>
<br/>
Whenever conflict arises, breathe deeply and remind<br/>
yourself &quot;conflict is an opportunity to teach and learn&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Focus on Responding to conflict rather than trying to eliminate it.<br/>
THIS is probably the most important thing I could have read!<br/>
My kids are only 18 months apart and we have conflicts fairly<br/>
regularly. I was raised in a family where my main objective was to<br/>
avoid conflict at all cost. It is a scary place for me to be<br/>
emotionally and I was trying to get my kids to &quot;just get along&quot; and<br/>
not seeing the benefit to all of us in their inherent struggles.<br/>
Now I am working on handling my emotions and helping them find ways<br/>
to get what they want. They seem to be better at it than me :)<br/>
<br/>
I know this was a super long post, but I though maybe more info.<br/>
would help show WHAT, in particular, I liked about the book. I am<br/>
still early in this unschooling journey and most of my time is spent<br/>
becoming a better person for myself and hopfully making some of<br/>
these ideas second nature for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
If these ideas are all obvious to you, be GLAD!<br/>
I have been changing a great deal since reading this book because it<br/>
just wasn&#39;t obvious to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-782639915">Hi Misty-  AS the mom of a child who often on the receiving end of <br/>
hitting by a friend I commend you for recognizing it and trying to do <br/>
something about it.  Once my son was hit so hard by my friend&#39;s dd <br/>
that she cried because it hurt her hand and then my friend looked at <br/>
me with a straight face and said &quot;well I&#39;d cry too if my hand hurt <br/>
from hitting someone.&quot;  It was then I walked out and didn&#39;t play with <br/>
her and her dd for a loooong while.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this probably won&#39;t be the total answer but maybe another <br/>
tool to help.  When my toddlers were violent for whatever reason to <br/>
another child I always comforted and paid A LOT of attention to that <br/>
other child very obviously in front of my toddler.  And when my very <br/>
verbal children wanted attention from me because they didn&#39;t like <br/>
that I was comforting the injured party I looked at them and <br/>
said &quot;But you treated so and so badly and you hurt them and I want <br/>
them to feel better.  I want you to help me but if you don&#39;t want to <br/>
then please sit down and be quiet.&quot;  Sometimes they became angry and <br/>
had a tantrum but I still stood my ground and after a while the <br/>
behavior ceased and they even learned to not only comfort the child <br/>
they hurt but wanted to comfort any upset child.  They are still like <br/>
this which is a joy for me.  Now maybe it was due to age and maturity <br/>
or maybe it was my method or a combination.  But hey, it&#39;s pretty <br/>
easy and free so maybe it&#39;s worth a try.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you.  Let us know how it turns out.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-569184241">This was the original &quot;no time-out&quot; post I read.<br/>
We never did do time-out, but this logic appealed to me.<br/>
If someone put me in a place I didn&#39;t want to be by force or <br/>
coersion, would I want to be helpful? Would I feel loved or <br/>
controlled? I have never &quot;sent&quot; my kids to the comfort corner, but I <br/>
do take them with me to their rooms or a comfy chair or away from <br/>
the group (if we are in public) and work to help them feel better <br/>
and then make ammends if something has happened. I say &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; <br/>
to the parents and the kid if necessary and offer help. Sometimes my <br/>
kids do, sometimes not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kiersten<br/>
----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
But why not time outs?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s actually a good question when the AAP has advocated for Time <br/>
Outs as a preferred alternative to corporal punishment.  In truth, <br/>
if the choice is between a spanking and a time out, I&#39;d suggest the <br/>
time out.  But that&#39;s not the only choice!  And both are rooted in a <br/>
punitive mindset.  A punishment is something that is added on to <br/>
teaching to cause the child to feel bad with the underlying belief <br/>
that only by feeling bad can they learn.  But, in fact, they learn <br/>
lots of things without feeling bad.  They learn to walk and talk and <br/>
spell their own name without requiring punishment, so the argument <br/>
that they can&#39;t learn if they don&#39;t feel bad is completely <br/>
unfounded.  In fact, a basic belief in GBD and PD is that people who <br/>
feel good act good while people who feel bad act bad.  So when a <br/>
child is acting bad it is illogical to think that making them feel <br/>
worse will somehow get them to act better.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I&#39;m speaking of classic time outs here.  Or, thanks to <br/>
Supernanny, what is sometimes referred to as a naughty place.  The <br/>
way this works is that a child is separated from the family and <br/>
ignored for a time that is equal to 1 minute per age of the child.  <br/>
The child is told that they are bad/naughty/misbehaving/etc and the <br/>
parent will get them when the time is up.  They are instructed <br/>
to &quot;think about&quot; what they have done wrong.  Supernanny insists on <br/>
an apology at the end .<br/>
<br/>
There are several punitive aspects to this.<br/>
<br/>
While Supernanny allows for young children to be viewable by the <br/>
family, traditional time outs, and her Naughty Room for older <br/>
children, require that the child be isolated away from the family <br/>
during the time out.  This gives the clear message to a child that <br/>
acceptance in the family is conditional upon their behavior.  If it <br/>
is not acceptable they are rejected; if it is acceptable, they are <br/>
accepted.  For many children this translates into a message of <br/>
conditional love.  Also, while introverted children may respond okay <br/>
to forced isolation, for many extroverted children this is traumatic.<br/>
<br/>
The one-minute-per year is an arbitrary time.  There is no guarantee <br/>
that a child will be calmed down in that time, and other children <br/>
will calm down long before that time is over.<br/>
<br/>
When an apology is required to leave the time out or naughty place <br/>
this is a forced apology and not a true indicator of a child&#39;s <br/>
remorse.  They are taught that an apology is a negotiating tool and <br/>
not taught empathy or remorse.<br/>
<br/>
In the place of classic time outs there are many GBD tools that <br/>
provide actual teaching and do not have the punitive aspects.  GBD <br/>
is an entire paradigm shift.  Children are not viewed as &quot;naughty&quot;.  <br/>
Parents and children aren&#39;t in battles that must be won.  Since <br/>
people who feel good act good, one goal of GBD is to help people <br/>
feel good.  Now, happy isn&#39;t the only acceptable emotion, and <br/>
there&#39;s lots of opportunity to use tools like reflecting feelings.  <br/>
The way that people learn how to feel good is to be equipped with <br/>
tools that they can use to exercise self control in difficult <br/>
situations.  Taking a break, or what is sometimes referred to as <br/>
a &quot;Positive time out&quot; is one way to do that.  As a means for <br/>
providing this, I recommend a Comfort Corner.<br/>
<br/>
A Comfort Corner is a space in the common area of a home that is set <br/>
up to be a retreat for a child (or an adult).  It&#39;s a place they can <br/>
go to step out of a situation, take a break, regroup.  There are <br/>
things there that provide them with comfort--stuffed animals, <br/>
pillows, blankets, music, books, whatever will bless your child.  <br/>
Let them help design it if you want.  It can be as simple as a chair <br/>
with a blanket, or as complex as a room under the stairs full of <br/>
options.  some will argue that this is rewarding poor behavior, but <br/>
if you aren&#39;t actively high fiving and saying &quot;awesome&quot; about their <br/>
poor behavior then you aren&#39;t rewarding or encouraging it.  I&#39;ve <br/>
never thanked my child for yelling or said that if they did I&#39;d give <br/>
them ice cream   One illustration I like to use, to make it relevant <br/>
for adults, is if I come over and you&#39;ve been having a bad day and <br/>
not behaving well (maybe grousing or yelling at the kids, not doing <br/>
your responsibilities around the house, etc) which would you prefer <br/>
me to do:<br/>
<br/>
1)  &quot;I&#39;m disgusted at the way you&#39;ve been behaving today. Your <br/>
children deserve better than this.  What kind of a mother do you <br/>
think you are?  You need to go into your room for 30 minutes (1 <br/>
minute per year  ) and really think about how bad you are.  I will <br/>
come and get you in 1/2 hour and then I will be nice to you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
2)  &quot;Wow, you&#39;re having a bad day.  How about I watch the kids for a <br/>
bit and you go get a cup of coffee and take a break    Come back <br/>
when you&#39;re feeling better and if you want to talk about what&#39;s <br/>
going on we can do it then.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
When a child is sent to the Comfort Corner the only rule is that you <br/>
don&#39;t talk about why they were sent when they are there, and they <br/>
may come out when they are ready to rejoin the family and be <br/>
cooperative.<br/>
<br/>
For older children there may be a need for a tool called &quot;you hit, <br/>
you sit&quot;.  When children get aggressive and violent it&#39;s appropriate <br/>
to stop their bodies and give them a chance to get their brain back <br/>
in control.  If you have a Comfort Corner they can be sent there, or <br/>
even just sitting on the couch until they are ready to be calm in <br/>
their play and make amends.<br/>
<br/>
I do teach children how to apologize, including the words ,&quot;I&#39;m <br/>
sorry&quot;, but more importantly the words, &quot;Will you forgive me?&quot;  And <br/>
I teach all of my children how to forgive--because forgiveness is <br/>
about casting off the burden of unforgiveness and going on with your <br/>
life at peace with others.  When you wrong someone you owe them a <br/>
debt. Making amends is about taking responsibility and doing what <br/>
you can to pay that debt.  We can never undo our actions, but making <br/>
an effort to repay the debt we owe someone teaches personal <br/>
responsibility for our actions, and is much more important than the <br/>
ability to say empty &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;s.  Saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; might be part <br/>
of making amends.  There may also be a need to offer a gentle touch <br/>
to make amends for a violent one, to return a toy and offer an <br/>
additional one where a toy was taken, to do a kind act where <br/>
unkindness was done.  I have the offending child ask the offended <br/>
child what kind thing they can do to help them feel better.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, GBD is about working to proactively prevent the situations <br/>
that would result in time outs.  By knowing our children well enough <br/>
to structure situations to set them up for success.  Using the 5 <br/>
Steps makes instructions non-optional and has built in &quot;help&quot; if the <br/>
child is not able to accomplish something themselves.  Ultimately, <br/>
rather than an adversarial relationship, GBD equips parents to be <br/>
the coaches on the family team.  There may be a time during a <br/>
sporting event where someone is pulled off the field to take a <br/>
Positive Time Out, or have a break, regain their cool and get ready <br/>
to go back on the field.  Something is very broken on the team when <br/>
someone is thrown from the game in a negative time out.  When you <br/>
view your family as a team it&#39;s much easier to see that when one <br/>
person fails, we all fail, but when one person succeeds, we all <br/>
succeed.  Success for all is the goal.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-63254420">In response to your post, Kristi, I wanted to mention that the <br/>
method <br/>
you described would not work for all children. I know that telling <br/>
my <br/>
child to be quiet and sit down when she was already frustrated <br/>
enough <br/>
to react physically would not help the situation at all; it would <br/>
cause things to really fall apart, and it would not foster a good <br/>
relationship between us either.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is hitting, she is obviously angry or frustrated and she <br/>
is <br/>
not able to communicate something that she wants to say very <br/>
*loudly*. <br/>
Rather than directing your attention away from them, I would prefer <br/>
to <br/>
give my child all of the understanding and attention that I can to <br/>
validate the emotions and talk about other ways to handle the <br/>
situation once things are calm.   <br/>
<br/>
If the other child is hurt or upset, by all means comfort him. And <br/>
by <br/>
all means let your kid know that hitting another person is not okay. <br/>
But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in anyone&#39;s best interest to ignore your own <br/>
child&#39;s feelings and expect them to immediately be ready to calm <br/>
down <br/>
and exhibit &quot;good behavior&quot;. Especially at 2.5, a <br/>
very young child probably doesn&#39;t have the maturity to decide what <br/>
the right action <br/>
is in an intense situation. It will be more respectful to them if <br/>
you <br/>
help and coach them through it. If a kid is crying or having a <br/>
tantrum, he needs your time and patience more than ever! <br/>
<br/>
To the originaly poster, I will try to write some more later, but I <br/>
second the suggestion that maybe your daughter isn&#39;t ready yet to <br/>
interact with kids her own age in play groups. If she could care <br/>
less <br/>
about it, then perhaps that is an indicator that she needs more time <br/>
to spend just learning and growing within the safety of her home.<br/>
<br/>
Also, having a daughter who is sometimes violent, I know that I have <br/>
to be with her *all* the time. Other children and other people have <br/>
a <br/>
right to be safe, so I need to make sure I am available to help her <br/>
or <br/>
intervene in a situation just in case.<br/>

&gt; to get her to stop.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had 2 children who hit when they were younger.  Keon still will hit<br/>
when he gets *very* angry.  Why do children hit, especially in the younger<br/>
years?  Because hitting is a physical reaction to express an unspeakable<br/>
emotion.  When a child is young or has difficulty expressing themselves when<br/>
they are emotionall upset, physical actions tend to take place of the words<br/>
that they can&#39;t say.  Some children will melt into a puddle.  Some children<br/>
will run away from the situation.  Some children will run to mommy to nurse<br/>
or be soothed.  And some people will act in a way that is seemingly<br/>
inappropriate.  Helping to give them words is a good way to help them<br/>
eliminate the physical action.  Give them the words when they are angry and<br/>
give them the words when they are not angry.  Talk about it.  Role play it<br/>
even.  Eventually your child will learn these things on her own but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t hurt to help her along.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I have noticed is that adults do their own form of &quot;hitting&quot;<br/>
when they are angry.  It&#39;s called cussing.  Why do people cuss?  Because it<br/>
shows a strong emotion like hitting does.  Running off a string of<br/>
explicatives is like punching the air with anger.  We have learned to<br/>
control the physical part of hitting, but the emotional part is still there,<br/>
just replaced by words.  I would love to see a study if children who were<br/>
hitters grew up to be adults who cuss.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another way to help eliminate the hitting is to consider when and where she<br/>
most hits.  Does she hit mostly at playgroup?  Does she truly enjoy<br/>
playgroup? When it is playgroup day is she excited, eager, and ready or do<br/>
you take her just because it is something to do?  If you miss playgroup does<br/>
she express a loss or go about what she is doing?  Perhaps waiting a while<br/>
on the playgroup front is what is needed.  Or maybe she needs to work with<br/>
smaller groups.  Have one friend over or at the most 2.  If she says she<br/>
likes playgroup, find out what it is about playgroup that she enjoys.  It<br/>
may be that she enjoys the park that you go to or playing with a particular<br/>
toy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847163834">***But I do know that aside from not wanting to teach<br/>
my child that hitting meant a ton of attention from me I also wanted to<br/>
teach them how to be kind by showing them how to be kind to others.***<br/>
<br/>
In our home, my presence and my attention are not rewards given for <br/>
appropriate behavior or privileges denied when my child makes poor <br/>
choices. She has a right to understanding and guidance at all times, <br/>
and I am *always* ready to be there, to intervene, to validate, to <br/>
give her the tools to make better choices. This is helpful because if <br/>
the child knows she has access to all the attention she needs just by <br/>
asking, you can trust that when hitting happens it isn&#39;t a plea for <br/>
attention. <br/>

I think they mean &quot;Grace Based Discipline&quot; and &quot;Positive Discipline&quot; <br/>
(not sure about the first).<br/>
I am not a Christian, but I have read lots of thoughtful posts on that <br/>
site.<br/>
<br/>
We had a few very religious moms in my old local moms&#39; group who were <br/>
pushing some very punitive books and stumbling across that site was a <br/>
breath of fresh air.<br/>
