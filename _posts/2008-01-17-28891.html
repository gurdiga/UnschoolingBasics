If you didn&#39;t attend the HENA 2007 Conference, <br/>
are you wondering what you missed? <br/>
<br/>
Here are the all of the unedited actual answers to <br/>
&quot;What did you like Best?&quot; from HENA 2007 Conference Attendees:<br/>
<br/>
The fact that you included activities for the kids. This is really <br/>
huge - I *so* appreciate that you did this. My daughter was looking <br/>
forward to the conference for months! Also the price!! Seriously, <br/>
what a *fantastic* deal! Two days of great speakers, a canvas bag, <br/>
kids activities, free parking, etc etc!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just thrilled that you guys did all the work to get HENA going <br/>
& to have the conference in the first place! Since I unschool, I <br/>
was happy to have all the unschooling speakers available - Sandra <br/>
& Pam. Everyone at the registration table was very friendly & helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Welcoming of kids and even a chance to put them on the college campus.<br/>
<br/>
I like the classes and the vendor fair.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter liked that there were lots of kids! She really enjoyed <br/>
sewing with Kt. I liked the unschooling panel and presentations. <br/>
I also really liked seeing the kids and teens. It assured me that <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling turns out some wonderful people.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling speakers<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd. She should have been keynote. The keynote speaker <br/>
should set the key note. The lawyer was great and I&#39;m glad she <br/>
came and spoke, but I enjoyed Sandra a lot, or would have liked <br/>
Pam S. to be keynote.<br/>
<br/>
I thought the conference was very well organized and that is so important.<br/>
<br/>
Activities for kids/husbands to attend while I could go around to <br/>
meetings/vendors. Loved the talent shows and panels with older kids <br/>
so that we could see the end result.<br/>
<br/>
Being with like minded people. The unschooling session with Pam and Roya.<br/>
<br/>
Very doable in one weekend. Smaller conference than we have been <br/>
to in the past, not so daunting. Loved the idea of kid&#39;s activities.<br/>
<br/>
I liked the location (ASU) which was close to restaurants etc..<br/>
<br/>
The amount of kids activities available, in the main hallway where <br/>
we could generally keep an eye on them. That was nice.<br/>
<br/>
Jessica Murphy –ASL<br/>
<br/>
The organization class, and the Unit Studies class.<br/>
<br/>
There was a really nice assortment of speakers.<br/>
<br/>
Speakers<br/>
<br/>
Meeting new people (homeschoolers) & learning about vendors<br/>
<br/>
We loved the ASU music student demonstration and how great they <br/>
were with the kids. There was always someone available to ask if <br/>
you had a question.<br/>
<br/>
Talent Show!<br/>
<br/>
It was so wonderful talking to unschoolers of older kids and know <br/>
that what I&#39;m doing is not only working for us but actually does <br/>
work! I feel much more positive about what I&#39;m doing (and not doing) <br/>
with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Meeting homeschooled kids and family groups- We were intrigued by <br/>
unschooling before we went-really enjoyed meeting unschooled students.<br/>
<br/>
While nothing was really &#39;new&#39; or innovative, I came away very <br/>
invigorated. Overall, the speakers re-affirmed many ideas that I&#39;ve <br/>
latched onto.<br/>
<br/>
While there were panels that we could ask advice/hear responses, <br/>
I learned more from the wee bits of testimony given by attendees <br/>
about what worked in their home. ~Honestly here, I am already <br/>
really looking forward to the conference next year! From the <br/>
attendee point of view - it was GREAT!<br/>
<br/>
The activities for kids were wonderful. My kids had the BEST time. <br/>
It was so nice to be able to take the kids and have them be a part <br/>
of things.<br/>
<br/>
Learning about how to keep records for graduation and college. <br/>
What universities expect from HS kids. Also, the organization was <br/>
great help. I think more about that would be great. Also, my <br/>
daughter loved the drama class and the out of africa exhibit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What will you enjoy? <br/>
