<div id="ygrps-yiv-285059340">The trouble at 101, that spawned this list, also spawned some <br/>
serious discussion among people not here, about why unschooling <br/>
lists seem to get contentious at times.  Sandra posted this at <br/>
unschoolingdiscussion, and I thought it was SO good and SO relevant <br/>
that I brought it here for you all to read. I hope you don&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
<br/>
Sandra:<br/>
I&#39;m going to bounce this into another topic area.<br/>
<br/>
Lately there has been discussion about why unschooling lists are <br/>
contentious. <br/>
 I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re more contentious than other lists on earth, <br/>
but if they <br/>
are, why would that be?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t just another way to homeschool.  And people are <br/>
accustomed to going to a book or magazine or website and getting the <br/>
simple five or ten facts they wanted, and then going and doing their <br/>
project.  When to divide bulbs and what fertilizer they need.  How <br/>
to clean a fireplace or who to call and how often.   What to <br/>
substitute for buttermilk in a recipe.   Where to get <br/>
pool chemicals, if you live in the boonies and want to mail order.<br/>
<br/>
So people look into homeschooling and they see that what happens is <br/>
a family <br/>
buys a curriculum.  Oh!  Here are some people who don&#39;t.  Okay, <br/>
instead of the <br/>
<br/>
curriculum, what do I use?  And hurry, I don&#39;t have much time to <br/>
read online. <br/>
 And could you e-mail it to me, because I might not find my way back <br/>
to this <br/>
forum.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are other factors too, more subtle.  Language works <br/>
with labels.  Words are labels.  People like to know who they are by <br/>
what they&#39;re called, <br/>
but they claim not to like it.  &quot;I don&#39;t like to be labelled&quot; is a <br/>
form of &quot;I&#39;m an individualistic person too cool to be pegged, and I <br/>
like to intimidate <br/>
other people to try make them think I can control how they may refer <br/>
to me.&quot;  <br/>
That&#39;s a lot of labelling right there.<br/>
<br/>
Christians are Christians the moment they&#39;re baptised or confirmed <br/>
or the moment they&#39;re born again.  No other approval.  &quot;You&#39;re in.&quot;<br/>
Jews are Jewish when they&#39;re born to a Jewish mom.  They&#39;re in.<br/>
<br/>
People who enroll in a school are students there.  There are <br/>
Montessori <br/>
students, and Waldorf students, and honor students, and pre-med <br/>
students (I love that one especially:  &quot;I&#39;m pre-med&quot;) and law <br/>
students...<br/>
<br/>
But with unschooling it doesn&#39;t quite work that way. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is more like riding a bike.<br/>
<br/>
Owning a bike doesn&#39;t make you a bicyclist, nor even a bike rider.<br/>
Walking the bike around certainly shows you&#39;re not a rider.  <br/>
Talking about riding it doesn&#39;t make you a bike rider.<br/>
Signing up for a course in bike riding (is there even such a <br/>
thing??) would <br/>
not make you a bike rider, nor would a certificate saying you had <br/>
completed a <br/>
course in bike riding change a damned thing if you couldn&#39;t get on <br/>
the bike and go.<br/>
<br/>
So with unschooling,  you can &quot;not buy the curriculum.&quot;   You can <br/>
not send your kids to school.   But when will you be an unschooler?  <br/>
<br/>
Is a caterpillar a pre-butterfly?<br/>
You have to change inside.  Nobody can tell the caterpillar he&#39;s <br/>
going to be a butterfly.  He might easily be bird food, or road kill <br/>
from a passing <br/>
bicyclist.<br/>
<br/>
The way to be an unschooler is to change the way you see and think, <br/>
so that you can change the way you act and react..<br/>
<br/>
Nobody can act like a bicyclist (maybe on an off-the-ground bike <br/>
with a bluescreen for a movie, but that&#39;s not riding a real bike for <br/>
real).  You either are doing it or you&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
People can&#39;t act like unschoolers and fool unschoolers into thinking <br/>
they&#39;re really riding it.   They have to become unschoolers inside <br/>
themselves to the point that they&#39;re not always asking &quot;Is this book <br/>
okay?  Is this idea okay?  <br/>
Is this game educational in any way, and how?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay to ask at first, but I think some people think they can <br/>
ask for twelve or thirteen years, instead of really becoming <br/>
unschoolers at the depth where it is part of their thinking and <br/>
being.<br/>
<br/>
And those who thinking asking forever is the same as being get angry <br/>
when those same people they were asking for help or approval <br/>
say &quot;You&#39;re not thinking it yet.  You&#39;re not keeping your balance <br/>
yet.  Just go fast enough to feel how you need to balance.  Ride it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I asked &quot;Which pedal should I start with?&quot; after two years of <br/>
riding a bike, my friends and relatives might think I was really not <br/>
too bright at all.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;How far should I lean when I turn?&quot;  Exactly far enough.  It works <br/>
by itself, when you do it.  When you become an unschooler, you will <br/>
know kids are learning because you see their eyes,  you hear their <br/>
breathing, you see their posture and you&#39;re there with them.<br/>
<br/>
And so some people, when they read things like that, think &quot;AH!  So <br/>
nobody can tell me if I&#39;m unschooling or not!  Whatever I say is <br/>
unschooling is, because kids learn all the time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.  But if the other bicyclists see you back at the starting <br/>
point messing awkwardly with your handlebars and not really going <br/>
anywhere, what you say you are or can do just won&#39;t impress them.<br/>
<br/>
Other people buy their unschooling.  We&#39;re making our own out of our <br/>
lives and families and homes.   We transform our lives into <br/>
unschooling lives, and it&#39;s just not the same as showing your <br/>
Calvert receipt and saying &quot;We use Calvert; the box should arrive <br/>
next week.&quot;<br/>
