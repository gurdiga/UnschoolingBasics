I only  pop in here periodically, so didn&#39;t see the original post.  But<br/>
one  thought came to me -- could your oldest be using drugs?  Her<br/>
behavior  has some definite hallmarks of drug users (I have a brother<br/>
who used, so  they are familiar) or of mental illness.  (And the line<br/>
can be blurry  sometimes, btw.)  <br/>
_______________________________________________<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, I too thought of that, but she passed the 2 drug tests she had to take  <br/>
for 2 jobs she landed. Its def. about her boyfriend. She did anything and  <br/>
everything to come to his call, or to be available, no matter what. When she ran  <br/>
out of money, she used my mom&#39;s credit card, took the money from Julian&#39;s <br/>
piggy  bank, her sister&#39;s purse, my wedding gifts of cash...you get the idea. <br/>
Drugs, in  some ways, would have been a clearer answer. But it&#39;s not that. I <br/>
really think  that her lack of self esteem has gotten her to do things she was/is <br/>
not ready  for yet, emotionally, and is now holding on for dear life to the <br/>
boyfriend (who  sent me a few nasty text messages telling me I couldn&#39;t text her <br/>
because he  &quot;owned her phone&quot; which made me want to scream, but I didn&#39;t. I <br/>
ignored him and  spoke to L about it directly). I&#39;m sure about her passing the <br/>
drug tests, as  they were sudden and she isn&#39;t savvy about that kind of thing, <br/>
and I am more  so...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still not sure what to advise you to do, though -- but  perhaps<br/>
identifying the problem would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought is  she might still be working through your divorce (or<br/>
not being together with  their father -- I don&#39;t know the details, and<br/>
it doesn&#39;t matter; what  matters is what is going on in her mind.)  No<br/>
first hand experience  with that.<br/>
Oh, yes. I think so too. She is very emotionally closed, hasn&#39;t said she  <br/>
loves me in YEARS - easily since age 6. The divorce was VERY hard on her. She  <br/>
claims too that she has &quot;hated&quot; her sister Grace since she was born, if not  <br/>
beforehand. <br/>
 <br/>
One things stands out - one day, their dad was supposed to come get them.  <br/>
They packed, they waited by the window to watch for his car. He was late, never  <br/>
called...she and James stood there for HOURS waiting for him. He called <br/>
later,  saying he was still in Laughlin, he overslept...and he wouldn&#39;t be coming. <br/>
I do  think her anger at her Dad is given to me. I&#39;m WAY safer to be angry at <br/>
than her  Dad is...I think she trusts me to hate me, if that makes sense...but <br/>
she feels  she has to hold on to dear life with her father, but he might <br/>
disappear in one  form or another...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You are right not to continue enabling her -- she will  definitely be<br/>
resentful right now, and not see why you did what you  did.  Hopefully,<br/>
down the road, she will look back at it  differently.  The stealing,<br/>
btw, combined with being unable to hold a  job (though that could have<br/>
multiple causes) is what made me think  addiction.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could be more helpful, but send all my best for you  in<br/>
dealing with this.<br/>
<br/>
(And for your other teens -- well, I have a  very cool teen who is<br/>
partially homeschooled, partially charter  schooled.  He loves not<br/>
being a traditional  student!)<br/>
Aren&#39;t they great? lol! I just am so prod of them, for so many reasons..am  <br/>
of Laura too, but the situation is obviously different right now. I&#39;m glad to  <br/>
hear of your son&#39;s happiness with himself. That&#39;s a goal we all should have -  <br/>
too bad it&#39;s so hard for some of us. <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you so much for your post. It was one of the hardest things in my  life <br/>
to do, kick her out. I question it all the time. But I just didn&#39;t know  what <br/>
to do anymore...<br/>
<br/>
