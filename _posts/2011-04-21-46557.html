<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259584996">Look for other folks in your area, for sure, and also any unschooling gatherings, conferences or meetups. A network like the Radical Unschoolers Network is handy for that, since it has a calender just in case you miss announcements on email lists. <br/>

Better than pen-pals is probably looking for other kids on facebook. There are unschooling pages there and &quot;friending&quot; unschoolers is a good way to connect your kids with theirs. I&#39;ve connected a couple unschoolers with a 10yo friend of mine (homeschooler - don&#39;t discount homeschooled and even school kids automatically!). Key places for some unschoolers to connect is via online role playing games like World of Warcraft and Runscape and also through Xbox live and the like. If your dd plays those kinds of games, she may be able to meet up with others with similar interests. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling kids don&#39;t automatically have anything in common other than unschooling, though. We&#39;re a diverse crowd. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531492272">We live on an island with no other kids and my daughter really likes having<br/>
penpals, so I think it&#39;s great idea.  I don&#39;t think it makes up for not<br/>
having friends to physically play/hang out with, but it is a connection<br/>
nonetheless.  My daughter likes mathish things and cooking, but up until<br/>
recently really hated physically writing.  For her, writing to friends<br/>
through both email and snail mail has been fun.  She doesn&#39;t mind writing<br/>
now that she is choosing to do so.  She also misses friends, but for us this<br/>
is less an unschooling reason than a location reason.  She loves checking<br/>
her email, and she loves dropping letters in the mailbox.  Trying it out<br/>
can&#39;t hurt!<br/>

<br/>
It may take some time. This is an ongoing issue for the majority of homeschoolers in a general sense - we&#39;re a very scattered minority group and when you pare your group down even more (from homeschool to unschool for instance) you&#39;ll have even less of a chance connecting. <br/>
<br/>
This is one reason why it can be important to look for ways to connect with other people (people of all ages, not just kids close in age) based on interests rather than &quot;unschooling&quot; - because just finding other unschoolers isn&#39;t enough. My 9yo, for instance, looks forward to getting to play with her unschooling friends at campouts, but has no interest in writing letters or getting on Facebook. In the past I tried to connect with other unschooling families - give out our address or my email to try and get something going - and the result was I ended up disappointing other families/kids. <br/>
<br/>
More recently I&#39;ve been helping a homeschooling friend of mine connect via facebook. She enjoys chatting in a general sort of way, and if very social so if your daughter likes to chat about popular tv, movies, games, clothes and hair and whatnot, look me up on facebook and send me a note and I&#39;ll send some friend suggestions. But she&#39;s not an unschooler. &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**************<br/>
<br/>
Because otherwise they don&#39;t have much to say to one another and the relationship never gets off the ground. An interest in having a pen-pal (or chat pal, like my young friend) can be enough of an interest for some people to build relationships out of nothing, but more often people need reasons to connect. <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t a &quot;have to&quot; as in there&#39;s some kind of rule, its more a matter of seeing how people form relationships in real life and using that information to help our kids. School sets us up to think kids form relationships with age-peers more often than not, when that&#39;s purely a result of packing dozens of age-peers into the same space every day. <br/>
<br/>
So part of deschooling for many parents involves stepping away from using the standardized formula of &quot;I have a (gender) child who is (x) years old&quot; as a way of helping another person find real peers and companions. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t have to. Nor do adults need the same interests. But if  <br/>
someone is intentionally seeking out others to connect with it&#39;s more  <br/>
likely to happen through interests than age or proximity or where they  <br/>
go to school. It&#39;s possible kids might connect as pen pals because  <br/>
they unschool and are the same age, but that&#39;s pure chance rather than  <br/>
because they both unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Often it&#39;s personality people click with but, again, similar  <br/>
personalities are more likely to share interests than age or living on  <br/>
the same street or unschooling. My daughters friends ranged in age  <br/>
from 5 years younger to 70 years older. She found them through shared  <br/>
interests. Unschoolers were more convenient as friends because they  <br/>
were free during the day, but only one is someone is still keeps in  <br/>
contact with. Kathryn&#39;s best friends she met on Subeta (a fantasy pet  <br/>
site) and deviantART.com because they all share an interest in metal  <br/>
music and drawing and writing about fantasy bands.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah I get that.  I just thought maybe organizing friendships via interests<br/>
is similar to doing so by age or gender.  I see the distinction though,<br/>
especially as it pertains to unschooling.  I imagine my almost ten year old<br/>
would dig learning about another culture or area of the US via snail mail<br/>
but eventually the novelty may wear off and if there&#39;s no relationship in<br/>
interests there, the penpal relationship would dissolve.  It would likely<br/>
involve coaching from me to make sure it didn&#39;t, for instance feeding her<br/>
questions to ask the friend, or ideas for trinkets to send, etc.  Not all<br/>
too unschoolish I suppose.<br/>

Be open to more than just written letters. They can still chat online-skype.<br/>
Online chating and Skype can be pretty awesome!<br/>
At the same time give and receive cards and letters or trade stuff via snail mail!<br/>

<br/>
This is one of the places parents new to unschooling get stuck, imagining what their kids would want, I mean. Part of connecting with kids well enough to know what they really want will take stepping back from imagining what you think they want for awhile because what you imagine is based on schoolish ideas about what kids *should* want. She &quot;should&quot; want to learn about another area and culture - but by some &quot;fun&quot; means like a pen pal rather than lessons. On some level, you&#39;re thinking in term of teachable moments and learning opportunities. Unschooling involves understanding that &quot;learning opportunity&quot; is as nonsensical as &quot;opportunity to blink&quot; but it can take a while for that idea to sink in!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a site with a list of blogs by kids who are unschoolers - you might try some of these. Not all the blogs are kept up but it might be a way to &quot;meet&quot; someone. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/resources/">http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/resources/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I&#39;ve just been asked for ideas of things to add to the Enjoy Life site and I think I&#39;ll see if we can put together some kind of space for trading contact info... the trouble is its a public site so anyone can find it. Hmmm, have to think about that. <br/>

It&#39;s better for those reading if we discuss the principles and ideas  <br/>
of unschooling that connect to an issue brought to the list rather  <br/>
than a specific child. The unschooling principle is to get to know  <br/>
your child to help her explore and support what she&#39;s interested in.<br/>
