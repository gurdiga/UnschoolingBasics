I saw this at a local list and thought you might find this interesting. Would be interested to find out what you guys think. This mom got a lot of bad comments, from mainstream as well as unschoolers. She does not say she is unschooling, but I believe what she does sounds perfectly fine.<br/>

Sounds like a perfectly fun and happy life. My problem with the author<br/>
is it seems like a lot of her priorities are all about herself,not<br/>
what&#39;s best for the child. However, what they are actually doing<br/>
sounds like a great unschooling life. Hanging out at a bar isn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily bad for a kid! If the parents are ignoring his needs to be<br/>
there that&#39;s a whole different thing..but it didn&#39;t sound like that&#39;s<br/>
what was happening at all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is how I felt about the article.  I think in reality they probably <br/>
are great parents but she does over emphasize her priorities alot.  <br/>
Doing those things is fine but perhaps  emphasizing more of the <br/>
benefits to her child and not primarily those to her and her husband <br/>
would have put Unschooling in a better light.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-589441704">That was also in my opinion. I mean obviously our needs come into play. When she was talking about that I was thinking, of course it is a lifestyle that fits our family BUT it is our child&#39;s need that should be listed first. Or at least somewhere. <br/>
Reading through the comments a little, I was surprised how many people thought 9pm was late AND letting your child sleep until they wake is SO horrible. Why would people think letting your child develop their own schedule during such a HUGE growth period in their life is horrible?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-462378935">DISCLAIMER:  (please note the heavy sarcasm and distaste with which these words were <br/>
written....they are not my personal feelings or beliefs, and may not pertain to every parent <br/>
out there that may want children to be on their schedule for their convenience....)<br/>
<br/>
**Why?  Because it is horribly inconvenient.  &quot;letting&quot; a child choose, how could you think <br/>
it?!? They would never make the right decisions.  They would never be able to choose right <br/>
from wrong and letting them stay up as late as they want and sleep in late does nothing <br/>
but cause frustration for &quot;we&quot; the parents because we Must get up early and having to wait <br/>
for a child to do what they &quot;think&quot; they &quot;need&quot; to do is ridculous!  We are the parents and <br/>
the children must learn to do what we think is best.   etc etc etc**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad we unschool.  I don&#39;t mind if they sleep in!  They are happy, healthy, get <br/>
enough food and water.  They may need to get up early for special things (such as their <br/>
grandparents are coming or we have to travel someplace)....but they can choose not to get <br/>
up or to sleep in the van.  Why have a child go to bed right in the middle of big thoughts <br/>
or designs when they are on a roll.  I don&#39;t think Thomas Edison would have done that.  He <br/>
would have kept working.....not even realizing the time.  I am sure his lab workers had to <br/>
remind him what day it was too.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I was really surprised by the hatred with which people responded.  Hatred toward <br/>
homeschool and unschool &quot;Freaks&quot; that we the parents are creating.  Hatred toward people <br/>
who tend toward a more European lifestyle.  I can understand that the author didn&#39;t seem <br/>
to be putting their child first, but still.  I don&#39;t think those who replied needed to be so hot <br/>
headed and heavy handed in their replies.  Most replies were unintelligent or guilt-ridden.  <br/>
I am sure from the replies that many of them have treated their children with disrespect <br/>
and forced everything.  How sad for their children...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757598673">So...I was very excited when I read about this, thinking &#39;yipee, a gathering so soon, months before Life Is Good,  maybe the girls and I can make it work!&#39;.  Last year we drove home from Seaside, Oregon to our home in Calgary, Alberta, and I was sure the state we cut across was Ohio.  So I went to a driving distance site and checked how long a drive it was from Calgary to Ohio, and it said...get this...3855 kilometres.  Ack!  Anyway, after a brush-up on my US geography, I realized we had driven through IDAHO, not OHIO.  So...bummer...we won&#39;t be driving 3855 kilometres to UWWG this year :).  Hee, sometimes I laugh at myself.<br/>
