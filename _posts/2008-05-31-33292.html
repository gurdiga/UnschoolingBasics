<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629068090">I am relatively new to the concept Radical Unschooling.  My children have<br/>
never been to school, but have done variations of schooling at home.  I have<br/>
spent time with a regimented schedule and learning process.  I have spent<br/>
time with all learning through play happened.  I have tried variations in<br/>
the middle to see what fit.  As it is now, I am finding that my children are<br/>
thriving as unschoolers.  I don&#39;t know that I would call myself radical yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I am wondering is how the adults made the transition from being schooly<br/>
(either recently or from years past) to RU.  I am having a tough time<br/>
getting the household chores done.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I want to play with<br/>
my kids all the time.  They are 9, 7, & 4.  They are delightful.  Where I am<br/>
running into issues is knowing that I need to run laundry or clean the<br/>
kitchen, but we&#39;d all rather play a game.  How do you get the cleaning stuff<br/>
done on a daily basis while being free in your schedule?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going through my transition to unschooling and am having arguments with<br/>
that little voice in my head saying that I should get one more task done<br/>
before I play the next game.  Any suggestions on transitioning, scheduling,<br/>
or including the housework into the play-day?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids are 17, 20, and 23. I just quickly unloaded the dishwasher. I  <br/>
cleared off the dining room table - which was piled with junk mail,  <br/>
and so on. My 17 yo cleared up the bathroom yesterday, but didn&#39;t  <br/>
sweep the floor and I have that on my mental list to do, because I  <br/>
notice every time I visit the bathroom (now that the room is clean,  <br/>
the unswept floor is calling to me &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
The house is cluttered. The kids do their own laundry - but mine is  <br/>
piled up in the laundry room waiting to be folded and put away. In the  <br/>
meantime, I&#39;m running out the door to go to my 23 year old&#39;s house -  <br/>
we&#39;re going to cook some stuff from a new cookbook we both just got  <br/>
(Hungry Girl) and we&#39;re going to make artist trading cards.<br/>
<br/>
So - just get used to doing what you can, ignoring the rest. And  <br/>
practice fitting it in in little bits during the whole day&#39;s flow. It  <br/>
is STILL like that for us. The BIG secret for me, about housework, was  <br/>
not to think of it as big lumpy jobs, but as constant little bits of  <br/>
&quot;not-much.&quot; Fold a few things here, put a few things away there. Wipe  <br/>
off a counter, clean a sink. I don&#39;t often &quot;clean the kitchen&quot; - but I  <br/>
clean up bits of it almost every time I&#39;m in there. I don&#39;t &quot;clean out  <br/>
the refrigerator&quot; but I clean out the inside of one door or just the  <br/>
fruit drawer - or I sort of browse through the fridge when I&#39;m getting  <br/>
something and I toss some old leftovers right then.<br/>
<br/>
So lots of housework gets done sort of without fanfare or much notice.  <br/>
When I decide to tackle something bigger - clean out a closet or  <br/>
reorganize shelves or something - kids will soemtimes get involved if  <br/>
I say, &quot;Hey, want to help?&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is the key for me. I do little bits every day, whatever I can <br/>
get to. My children are younger, 4 years and 11 months <br/>
breastfeeding, so there are a lot of times when I *have* to attend <br/>
to them and really *can&#39;t* fold the laundry. When I do get a moment <br/>
to myself I definitely don&#39;t want to spend it cleaning. I&#39;ve never <br/>
been an over-achiever in the housework department, anyway, so it&#39;s <br/>
probably easier for me to walk away from it. <br/>
<br/>
There is almost always a basket of laundry sitting in the hall by <br/>
the machines, either waiting to be washed or waiting to be brought <br/>
upstairs to be folded and put away, each of those things done one at <br/>
a time. The kitchen floor needs to be swept every day but isn&#39;t <br/>
always. I got a Roomba that I can turn on downstairs and then come <br/>
upstairs or outside and let it run. It doesn&#39;t get every little bit <br/>
off the floor but it&#39;s better than nothing. (Although, I read on the <br/>
box that it cancer known carcinogens that can cause reproductive <br/>
problems. Not sure what that is about.) There are toys all over the <br/>
place. I like that, though. It means my kid has been having fun.<br/>
<br/>
My husband does a lot because he cares more about things being neat <br/>
(not necessarily clean). He likes to pick up the toys in the <br/>
playroom and wash the dishes. He fold laundry on the weekends or at <br/>
night if I leave it piled on the bed. He occupies the kids on the <br/>
weekends so I can clean a bathroom or mop a floor.<br/>
<br/>
It does bother me sometimes. I&#39;ll get overwhelmed if I think about <br/>
everything that needs to be done every day. I tend to shut down when <br/>
that happens so things just get worse. I just try not to think about <br/>
it too much. It&#39;s a conscious effort sometimes.<br/>

  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-====<br/>
<br/>
  *fold* the laundry?  I never fold laundry!  Except tea towels becuase they won&#39;t fit in the drawer otherwise.  I hang up everything that I wear, except underwear - for the baby clothes, why not jsut leave them a basket - I used different coloured basskets - white for clean :-), some other colour for dirty - <br/>

  WHOA!  Can you hire him out!?  My ex-husband did abolsutely *zero* and when the girls got older he spent a lot of time yelling at them to try and get *them* to clean up (he himself is pretty much the messiest person in the universe, but for some reason *other* people&#39;s mess drives him *insane*)<br/>

<br/>
  It *is* overwhelming to think about everything that needs to be done - and of course the thing about housework is that - it&#39;s never done!  You are always somewhere in the middle!  I found for myself lately that that has actually helped, because I do what I can do it that moment, right then, and that has to be enough - because you*will* drive yourself truly insane if you worry about it.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  You have done a lot towards simplifying and you have help!  All you can do is the best you can do - perfectionistic ideas will just defeat you...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Eckhart Tolle (The New Earth) talks about keeping our minds totally in the present moment, allowing worry about the past and the future to drop away - because they don&#39;t exist.  And worry about housework is a constant critical voice going on in the background of our minds - try to capture that stream of consciousness - what is that voice saying?  &quot;You are a bad mother, your children are growing up in an unsanitary environment, you *should* be able to handle this, you are just lazy,&quot; etc, etc, etc - if you can tune into that voice, you can turn it OFF. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699722587">Running a load of laundry is a matter of &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a minute,<br/>
pause the game&quot; (or skip my turn, or whatever is appropriate for that<br/>
particular situation) - toss in the laundry, start it, you&#39;ve got<br/>
somewhere between 20 and 40 minutes (depending on the wash settings for<br/>
your particular machine and load). Then, another 5 minutes to toss it<br/>
into the dryer and again 30-45 minutes or so for it to dry. Save the<br/>
folding for when everyone&#39;s content to watch a video or something. My DH<br/>
is the at home parent (and DS, turned 10 TODAY) is an only child so<br/>
there aren&#39;t siblings handy to &quot;play with&quot; if DH is not available.<br/>
They&#39;ve decided that it works best (given there&#39;s only 3 of us) to spend<br/>
one day per week doing laundry. DH will get it sorted early in the<br/>
morning (he&#39;s up around 6, DS gets up anywhere from 7 to 11 depending on<br/>
when he went to sleep) and down to the basement laundry room. They&#39;ll<br/>
play videogames or whatever usual stuff they want to do with short<br/>
pauses for DH to switch laundry loads. Around 9 pm it all gets carried<br/>
back upstairs to the bedroom when DH and I head up. We&#39;ll pop in a DVD<br/>
or pick a TV program and have a folding party - DS often pops in if he&#39;s<br/>
not doing anything else and handles the washcloths, towels, and his<br/>
clothing (easier to manage because it&#39;s smaller than DH&#39;s 3X t-shirts).<br/>
Sometimes, if DS is occupied and DH wants to, he&#39;ll fold it as it gets<br/>
finished but that&#39;s not &quot;required&quot; - there are busy weeks when we live<br/>
out of the clean laundry baskets (we have separate baskets for clean and<br/>
dirty laundry).<br/>
<br/>
Dishes sometimes get done immediately after the meal - since that&#39;s a<br/>
&#39;break in the action&#39; anyhow - but more often than not, the day&#39;s dishes<br/>
get done after dinner. Sometimes, DH will get the previous day&#39;s stuff<br/>
done in the early morning while DS is still asleep. And sometimes he&#39;ll<br/>
do it while DS is otherwise occupied in something (He&#39;s heavily into<br/>
designing new maps/scenarios in Warcraft, not WoW, related but not the<br/>
same thing). <br/>
<br/>
Stuff like bathroom cleaning and sweeping floors and all (wood floors in<br/>
all but one room) gets done in one swoop usually on Saturday mornings.<br/>
That way, DH and I are both there and can kind of &#39;tag team&#39; so that one<br/>
of us can be available when DS needs. For that matter, sometimes DS<br/>
chooses to come grocery shopping with me of a Saturday and DH will do a<br/>
once over on the house while we&#39;re gone.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, sort out the &quot;really need to get to&quot; stuff from the &quot;voices<br/>
in my head say I have to&quot; stuff. Note there&#39;s no &quot;have to&quot; category<br/>
because there are really very few &quot;have to&quot;s in life - aside from death,<br/>
most other stuff is &#39;optional&#39; we&#39;re just trained to think it&#39;s<br/>
required. Don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; eat or breath or sleep even - of course, the<br/>
consequences of those are pretty dire past a certain point. This<br/>
morning, the dishes at our house &#39;really need to&#39; get done - busy<br/>
weekend left more dishes than usual in the sink. Plus, with warmer<br/>
weather, the odds of flies and other critters increases so doing dishes<br/>
rises in the priority level. So, that&#39;s high on DH&#39;s list for today<br/>
(it&#39;s not a physical list, more of a general mental idea of what he<br/>
wants to do for the day) - dishes, duct tape, and DS&#39; birthday dinner<br/>
tonight at our favorite sushi place. Everything else is negotiable. Last<br/>
night, DS asked if we could play MegaMonopoly after dinner - no problem,<br/>
just let me clear the table of the dinner stuff first, then I need to do<br/>
my 30 minutes on the treadmill (as a type 2 diabetic, daily exercise is<br/>
critical for my health so that&#39;s a priority item), so I should be ready<br/>
around &lt;time&gt; to play. I *could* have said &quot;No I can&#39;t play, I have to<br/>
do the dishes&quot; but really, there&#39;s no &quot;have to&quot; re: dishes - they&#39;ll<br/>
still be there in an hour or a day. The one thing that does get priority<br/>
is our individual mugs that we use for our evening tea time (somewhere<br/>
between 8 and 9 pm most evenings) - those get washed out even if there&#39;s<br/>
still a stack left, tea time is a priority.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if this will help much or if it&#39;s pretty much just an early<br/>
Monday morning ramble...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180019567">It was a lot easier for me to get everything done when I only had one <br/>
child and I was working. A lot of it was because no one was home <br/>
during the day for 5 days out of the week. A lot less dishes and <br/>
things/toys were used. We would save all the cleaning except for daily <br/>
dishes until the weekend. I&#39;d do everything on Sunday morning and we&#39;d <br/>
still have the majority of the weekend to relax or do something fun.<br/>
<br/>
Now with a baby and a young one and 3 of us at home every day it&#39;s a <br/>
lot harder. There&#39;s a lot more to do constantly. It&#39;s never done. It <br/>
really bothered me right after I had my second child but I&#39;ve come to <br/>
realize it&#39;s just the nature of our lives now. I can have a clean home <br/>
when the kids are grown and I&#39;m old and gray. Of course, by then I <br/>
probably won&#39;t be able to do as much physically so the house will <br/>
still be a mess. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I am seeing that as my children get older every day I can do a little <br/>
more and still have time for them. Just like the bedtime thing, it&#39;s <br/>
changing every day. I have to be flexible and not expect to get <br/>
anything done. Then when I do get something done it feels good. I also <br/>
don&#39;t think of cleaning as something I *have* to do anymore. I <br/>
realized that I do it because I want to for one reason or another. <br/>
That makes doing it a lot more tolerable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279380186">My mom&#39;s motto (which she may have gotten via Erma Bombeck, not sure<br/>
about that) was &quot;what would you rather have on your tombstone: she had a<br/>
clean house or she always had time to play with the kids?&quot; It was tough<br/>
on my mom - she&#39;s very much a tidy, keep it organized, type person BUT<br/>
she had a stroke when my sister (youngest of us 3) was 3 months old (Mom<br/>
was all of 28 at the time, I was 5, bro was 3). While she didn&#39;t have<br/>
any permanent damage from the stroke (thankfully), she did have to<br/>
ration her energy use because the stroke was just an effect of her<br/>
already-damaged heart muscle. Sometimes the dishes or the vacuuming had<br/>
to wait while she organized a Cub Scout meeting or baked cupcakes for a<br/>
class party at school or walked us around the block trick or treating.<br/>
Today, she&#39;s 70 years old and enjoying her 5 grandkids (and 3, soon to<br/>
be 4, grand dogs).<br/>
