<div id="ygrps-yiv-249952749">Um...I just wanted to be sure that I didn&#39;t miss something and this is not <br/>
for me-Karen, but another one? I&#39;ve been so busy, I&#39;ve only skimmed most of the <br/>
emails recently (I joined like 3 or 4 more yahoo groups and I&#39;m chock full of <br/>
email each day, lol!), so I may well have missed something, and I don&#39;t want <br/>
to appear silent if anything was indeed for or at me...<br/>
