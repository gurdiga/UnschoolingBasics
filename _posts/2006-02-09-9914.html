<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564423071">&lt;&lt;&lt;What do you do about grammar?  Does that just &quot;work itself out&quot; by<br/>
reading and writing?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Believe it or not, they do figure it out.  My son, Kevin, has some of <br/>
the best spelling and grammar and he has never had a formal lesson.  <br/>
He knows when a sentence sounds right and when it doesn&#39;t.  He used to <br/>
be a big reader of books but now most of his reading is on the <br/>
computer, for which he spends hours a day on!  With his spelling, he <br/>
knows I am always available and quite often (used to be dozens of <br/>
times a day, now just a few times a day) just calls out and asks me <br/>
how things are spelled.   I tell him the answer, he types it, and he <br/>
is on with whatever he is doing.  Most people don&#39;t know all the <br/>
jargon of grammar but we know how things are supposed to sound in a <br/>
sentence, that is what is really important.<br/>
