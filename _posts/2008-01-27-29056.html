<div id="ygrps-yiv-21867335">I was going through old papers the other day and ran across this. Rue <br/>

&quot;There are times when I try to remember who the parent is. When Dagney <br/>
and I are both cranky, and feeling bickery, I try to remember that I&#39;m <br/>
the parent, and I have more of a reserve of patience than she does. I&#39;m <br/>
the parent, so I can step back and change how I&#39;m acting more easily <br/>
than she can. When Rowan wants me to get up for the hundredth time to <br/>
get her something in the kitchen, I remember I&#39;m the parent, and she <br/>
can&#39;t do everything she wants without asking for help. I can make her <br/>
feel good or bad about that. I&#39;m the parent, and I can choose to <br/>
happily help her when she wants me to. When either one of them wants me <br/>
to drop what I&#39;m doing to do something with her, I remember that I&#39;m <br/>
the parent of two kids who won&#39;t be kids forever. I remember that I <br/>
don&#39;t want to miss one minute of being their parent.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-868460083">I recently ordered and read this fabulous book!  I have given it out to family and a few friends who have honestly wanted to know what we&#39;re doing.  I just love the profound respect for her kids that shines through on every page.  I wish she would write more here too!<br/>

Kelly, I copied that VERY paragraph in the book - LOVE the book! Love <br/>
Rue!<br/>

<br/>
Rue is one of our moderators, so know that she reads everything you <br/>
write! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Rue used to post a LOT. But she took time off the lists to write her <br/>
book, and then I think she kind of enjoyed the peace and quiet. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Each of us will take some time off during the year to regroup and <br/>
refocus, but we&#39;re all *here*---just not necessarily putting our <br/>
energies toward writing/answering questions.<br/>
<br/>
I know she&#39;s busy with her girls: they&#39;ve gotten busier too! Dagney and <br/>
Her boyfriend, Andrew, just visited us here while on their <br/>
cross-country road-trip.<br/>
<br/>
AT least we have her great book!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163591007"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I didn&#39;t know she was on this list! <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>**I&#39;m here :o).  I actually read every post. For whatever reason my<br/>
energy doesn&#39;t seem to go much towards writing these days.  I&#39;ve noticed<br/>
it before over the years - and then suddenly you can&#39;t shut me up &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve had from one to nine extra unschoolers here over the past week,<br/>
and I wish anyone with doubts about unschooling could&#39;ve been a fly on<br/>
our walls.  Amazing, fun, happy, *kind* bunch of kids.  (And we met a<br/>
bunch of them through Live and Learn - thank you Lovejoys!!)  Eleven<br/>
kids from 11-19 years old, singing, playing drums and piano, eating<br/>
(lots &lt;g&gt;), playing Wii, talking, cooking, playing cards, turning their<br/>
hair blue, laughing.  Jon and I had an idea from being teenagers<br/>
together of how we hoped our house would be when our kids were<br/>
teenagers, but I don&#39;t think we had ever imagined just how good it could<br/>
be.<br/>
 <br/>
The last group left a couple of hours ago and suddenly our house is very<br/>
quiet!   ~Rue<br/>

There is a new book coming out and I think Rue has two chapters in it:<br/>
