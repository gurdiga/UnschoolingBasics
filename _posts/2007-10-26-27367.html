<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007741179">Hi there Ive just joined this group and Im looking for support and information about unschooling, Im a solo mum and Ive homeschooled my son Joshua for about 6 years now, alot of the time I find homeschooling very hard , and I havent had alot of support, I now know that my beleif  in homeschooling is more closer to unschooling, and reading the info about the waysthat unschooling is done it sounds like its so me and my boy josh. <br/>
<br/>
Joshua and I had a very bad experience with an ERO vist about 2 1/2 years ago and I ended up reporting this lady to the ministry of education for what she said to us and for the way she handled the situation, the big boss revisited us and reveiwed the situation and it left me and joshua traumatised by the whole process.  and its crushed our confidence totaly, both joshua and I had a very hard time with picking up the peices and continuing homeschooling.I really felt like after I had that visit, I was suffering from burn out.. but over the years we did the best we could, I changed my method of teaching to a more creative hands on one. and pushed aside cataloguing everything. since then without realising it Ive actually been doing more of the unschooling method rather than homeschooling which I find is a bit to formal for my liking,<br/>
 <br/>
My boy is very sensitive and creative, hes very bright but absolutly hates writing and wont do it,Joshua has a talent with working with animals,and shows such kindness and compassion towards creatures, so this is the basis of his learning that I work around.  We have lots of animals 7 cats, 2 birds ,6 chooks, an axolotal fish, and 4 skinks. all animals are joshuas except the cats are my babies.<br/>
 <br/>
After our ERO visit, I lost the fun in doing homeschooling.Ive since read a bit of information regarding unscholing and Id like to get to know anyone who does unschooling, and better still, if theres anyone who lives near me ,it would be great to meat. we live in the far north in Kaitaia, (NZ) we have been blessed with the oppertunity to rent a house which is surounded by a pretty stream and native bush.unfortunetly I dont drive so living out in the country does have its bad points with having to rely on people.<br/>
<br/>
My boy joshua loves his playstaion and as a way of getting over our ERO visit I alowed him to play it when he wanted and then I sudenly realised that he was learning to read better through something that interested him, Joshua knows what sort of games that I dont like him to play and hes very good, he knows his limits.<br/>
He enjoys computer even though his writing skills are not the best, thats when Im there to help. Hes just recently joined the BEBO chat group on computer, I wasnt sure at first if it was the right thing, but now Ive come to see that hes getting to know friends. I do however check up once in a while to supervise what contents is coming through or going out. <br/>
Lately weve been given an electric Jigsaw which josh has been using flat out. cutting wood and building bird boxes, <br/>
As a solo mum Ive found it very hard having to forfull the position of a fathers guidance, (ohh for the male support for josh. but we make do). Im entering into a new relationship with a guy thats not supoortive of homeschooling /unschooling and weve had our heated discussions. (YUK! YUK! YUK!) but I can see that hes learning and like me we find it hard to stand up for our beleifs with homeschooling, particuly with those judgementle people who comment about the situation without knowing anything, Im afraid I wear my heeart on my sleeve and take critism deeply. A major lesson I need to build on. Im hoping that through some support I will gain the knowledge to be a confident teacher for my son, and with the wisdom that I learn, then just maybe I can encourage my new boyfriend to accept and support our way of life.<br/>
Hoping to hear back from those willing to giude and support us.<br/>
from Dawn and Joshua Booth  :-) <br/>
