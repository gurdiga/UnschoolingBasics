<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351992659">I have been watching with interest all the conference information that<br/>
comes up on various lists.  Especially the L&L one, since we are in<br/>
NC.  I haven&#39;t registered yet because I&#39;m not sure if we will be moved<br/>
off to Minnesota by then. (Hi Alex! ;) )  The other reason is because<br/>
of accessibility issues --<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;m Deaf, I usually request an ASL interpreter for events.  I&#39;m<br/>
also aware of two things - one, that the conference budgets are tight,<br/>
and two, that my own budget is tight.  There are other Deaf<br/>
homeschooling families but no unschoolers that I know of, so it could<br/>
be $70 an hour to provide access for me.  Not exactly economical for<br/>
conferences not run by organizations.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m wondering -- has anyone ever experienced having Deaf attendees<br/>
or second language attendees to their conferences?  How did you<br/>
resolve the interpreter issue?<br/>
<br/>
Some more thoughts on that: It would be neat if there was an added<br/>
line item in sign-up forms that asks if you have an intermediate+<br/>
level in a foreign language and would be willing to provide<br/>
translation services in exchange for a discount if needed. (like the<br/>
work-discount setup at L&L?)  On the other hand, there&#39;s also the<br/>
problem of not  being able to &quot;fire&quot; volunteers if their abilities<br/>
aren&#39;t strong enough.  Plus, in NC the law says if an uncertified<br/>
interpreter is used in a certain setting, the person and the people<br/>
responsible may be fined, possibly up to $5k.  I would have to look<br/>
into that to be sure what settings it applies to...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565979634">HI !!!!!!! So where are you moving to in MInnesota ??? I used to live in NC before MN....<br/>
  Anyways, I have worked  as a translater ( POrtuguese) IN NC for the Special Olympics in 1999 as a volunteer. I have no acreditation for it and it was not a problem.<br/>
  I will have to brush up my basic ASL to meet you ( I love it ASL) and maybe I can learn more with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
  As for the Conferences I guess so far everyone spoke english in them, with a few bilingual families ( like me and my kids)but I have only been to L & L last year so I may be wrong!<br/>

Interpreter Brain :)<br/>
I&#39;d LOVE to interpret an unschooling conference, alas we&#39;ll not be making<br/>
the journey to L&L this year :(<br/>
I&#39;ve often imagined myself interpreting for the speakers I listen to (part<br/>
of being unable to turn my internal interpreter, things like speeches get<br/>
automatically translated to ASL before storage. Kinda like my internal zip<br/>
file :::bg:::). It&#39;s also a situation where an unschool experience would<br/>
greatly assist the interpreter, as the nuances of the English Language are<br/>
different in our context, in ways not as obvious to those unfamiliar with a<br/>
conceptual language like ASL.<br/>
<br/>
Another challenge would be overuse. There&#39;re not big breaks between speakers<br/>
(all of whom you&#39;d want to see!), if you wanted to see a couple in a row, it<br/>
would be physically tough for a veteran, let alone a newbie &#39;terp.<br/>
It could be done, and it could be a beautiful experience. I sure hope it<br/>
works out for ya!! Your life will NOT be the same after a conference :D<br/>

 </span></blockquote>***like the work discount, but bigger. It&#39;s A LOT more work to interpret<br/>
than any of the other volunteer positions available. Good interpreters are<br/>
worth the investment (as you, Adrean, know all too well, I&#39;m sure!!),<br/>
especially at a conference setting where the on/off time line is very<br/>
blurred.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In 1992 I interpreted a NASA conference while working at CSUN, as one<br/>
student&#39;s personal interpreter. It was amazing and tough and challenging and<br/>
FUN and enlightening and... and... :D  Then, the professional standard was:<br/>
transportation, lodging, all meals, $250/day stipend and back-up<br/>
professionals as needed. You&#39;re right, &#39;twould be tough for Kelly to do,<br/>
though I don&#39;t think this job belongs in the same category as the other<br/>
volunteer jobs. Especially as an interpreter, bound by professional code of<br/>
ethics, would not be having his/her *own* conference experience while on the<br/>
clock.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 5 cents worth ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At the last Northeast Unschooling Conference we did have a deaf dad. We  <br/>
searched for an interpreter, but even apart from the expense, which was  <br/>
considerable, we were unable to find someone available (for a Memorial Day  weekend). <br/>
As I am sure you know, there&#39;s a big shortage of ASL interpreters. If  we had, <br/>
we couldn&#39;t have covered the whole thing --we would have lost lots of  money.<br/>
 <br/>
The family was awesome, and this is what we were able to work out. All of  my <br/>
presenters who used written speeches for their talks happily gave him  <br/>
printouts he could read. The big problem was that he really wanted to be able to  <br/>
attend the Dad&#39;s gathering. <br/>
 <br/>
We lucked out! One of our vendors was this awesome man who was doing a  <br/>
Funshop on ASL and is staff at RI School for the Deaf. He offered to interpret  for <br/>
the Dad&#39;s group for a very reasonable cost.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a hard issue. I would think if there is flexibility something can be  <br/>
worked out to make things happen, usually.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-674333766">Do you have a laptop by any chance? There are a few programs out..one is dragon naturaly speaking that will translate speech to text on your screen. The presenters could clip a wireless mic on and you&#39;d have the typed version via laptop screen. <br/>
   <br/>
  That still makes things complicated for workshops where many ppl are speaking and isnt as naturaly flowing as ASL but its a start . <br/>

  How old are your kids? <br/>
