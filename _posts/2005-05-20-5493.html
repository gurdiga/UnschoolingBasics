<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922134561">Hi, everyone!  I&#39;m Tina, unschooling mom to Adrian, 11 years old.  <br/>
We have been unschooling for a year and a half now.  I am SO HAPPY <br/>
we discovered unschooling.  It has been an extreme pleasure watching <br/>
him grow and come &quot;out of his shell&quot; so to speak.  <br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I&#39;ve not had much trouble adjusting in regard <br/>
to &quot;schoolish&quot; type subjects &quot;being missed&quot;.  I know that&#39;s not the <br/>
case and am very comfortable with our decision to unschool.  <br/>
Deschooling was a very enjoyable process for the both of us, I do <br/>
believe.<br/>
<br/>
However, this is where my concern is lying now.  I&#39;ve no experience <br/>
or concrete references in relation to &quot;parenting issues&quot;, for lack <br/>
of better wording, as it relates to an unschooling lifestyle.  Here <br/>
is my current concern...<br/>
<br/>
Since we began unschooling Adrian&#39;s intersts have been changing.  <br/>
Normal, I know, and a very positive thing indeed.  I do not limit <br/>
television or video games or food or anything.  He is an excellent <br/>
desision maker because of this, I&#39;m sure.  PS2 and computer games <br/>
are a passion for him, and he absolutely loves Adult Swim cartoons <br/>
and South Park.  Also, bear in mind that he is number seven, and the <br/>
other six are all PS children...out of my control...even longer <br/>
story.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Well, Adrian has a very mature sense of humor.  He likes to share <br/>
little snippits from cartoons he&#39;s watched that he finds <br/>
particularly funny.  He also likes to tell more mature jokes and has <br/>
a very dry sense of humor.  The flip side is that he carries on very <br/>
adult conversations and can make nearly anyone pause for thought <br/>
with his opinions.  He is an interesting kid to converse with.  This <br/>
is where my question is...how do I teach him tact without squelching <br/>
the self-esteem and level of comfort he&#39;s established in sharing <br/>
converation with others?  I want him to feel free to talk about <br/>
what&#39;s on his mind.  BUT, I also want him to learn that some things <br/>
just aren&#39;t appropriate to talk about with certain people.  Not <br/>
everyone is going to find his jokes or the scenes from South Park <br/>
amusing.  <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone share anything with me on this?  Has anyone been there, <br/>
done that?  Do you know of any resources I can utilize?  I&#39;m an avid <br/>
reader and regular at the library.  Any imput is welcome and wanted <br/>
as this is new territory for me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141351045">Haven&#39;t BTDT, but I think it would probably work the same as anything <br/>
else - verbalize how *you* determine what to say in different <br/>
situations and hand along any information you have that you think <br/>
might be useful. Same as you might discuss appropriate behavior for a <br/>
wedding or a funeral or any other social situation.</div>

<br/>
Just tell him - I bet he can already tell he gets different reactions <br/>
from different people. So elaborate on that - and point out that it <br/>
takes a certain amount of skill to learn when and where to say what.<br/>

We live in the middle of people who school-at-home because they don&#39;t want their kids to associate with anyone who isn&#39;t a fundamentalist Christian.  And since we homeschool, they tend to assume we are fundamentalist Christian (jokes on them with that one).  Being unschoolers, my kids tend to have broader vocabularies, jokes, interests, etc. than most of the area homeschoolers their ages.<br/>

<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
I have no problems with &quot;blue&quot; language. I have quite the potty mouth <br/>
myself! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It IS important to know, &#39;though, WHEN it&#39;s proper to use such <br/>
language. I suggest that their grandmothers wouldn&#39;t appreciate it, but <br/>
I also tell them that most of their friends would get into it at a <br/>
certain age. I suggest that it doesn&#39;t sound very nice coming out of a <br/>
three year old&#39;s mouth (although it *can* be funny! &lt;g&gt;), so to please <br/>
not use those words in front of younger children<br/>
<br/>
Know your audience. Know your situation.  Be aware.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that hard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-753396713">Hi Tina,<br/>
Oh, I know exactly where you are coming from! My youngest is only the<br/>
youngest of four...but we do run into this quite often. Part of it is that,<br/>
as the youngest, he is exposed to things my oldest would never have been<br/>
exposed to. On top of that, many of his friends are first-borns....without<br/>
exposure to teens...and their parents don&#39;t have teens...and then, add to<br/>
that our very eclectic group of friends from church to neighbors, to<br/>
school-at-home-families, different parenting philosophies....it can be tough<br/>
sometimes.  He is better now than he used to be...we do a lot of discussing<br/>
of the differences in our friends and respecting others&#39; choices....if I<br/>
think it will be an issue, I will &#39;remind&#39; him of what may be unacceptable<br/>
to a particular family or group we are going to be interacting with.  Ben is<br/>
actually pretty sensitive to stuff like this and that helps...I have other<br/>
kids less attuned to these things but it was less of an issue when they were<br/>
younger (Ben is my only always unschooled child)...and many of our friends<br/>
have just learned to shake their heads at us but accept us none the<br/>
less....so not sure I have any advice for you...but I understand...<br/>

<br/>
Do you talk about that when he&#39;s NOT in the presence of those who would <br/>
find his conversations offensive?<br/>
<br/>
Like, when watching South Park and Family Guy, we&#39;ll mention that Nanny <br/>
(grandmother) wouldn&#39;t really get that joke or would be offended <br/>
watching/hearing it. Blue language is the same: I don&#39;t mind their <br/>
using rough language---but there&#39;s a time and place for it. Around <br/>
strangers and grandparents isn&#39;t the best place! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Yes, I do talk to him outside of the situation, and always in <br/>
private.  I don&#39;t even discuss it around our immediate family <br/>
members...just him and I.  He seems to get it a little better now.  <br/>
I think  he&#39;s starting to have an understanding, at least a little <br/>
more so, of what&#39;s acceptable and what is not.  <br/>
<br/>
This has been a long process, and we still have a ways to go.  I am <br/>
seeimg small changes, though.  At least it&#39;s a start.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I do give polite nudges if I&#39;m concerned that the conversation may <br/>
be taking an inappropriate turn like, &quot;Is this something that <br/>
Grandma will enjoy?&quot;  He&#39;s getting better at making the judgement <br/>
call, and I&#39;m getting better at communicating with him in the <br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all good...<br/>
