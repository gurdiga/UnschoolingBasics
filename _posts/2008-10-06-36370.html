<div id="ygrps-yiv-914448176">That&#39;s true. One could do just that, but one would really miss out on<br/>
the science of how soap becomes soap - how a caustic chemical such as<br/>
lye, when mixed with heated oil and mixed can produce some of the<br/>
mildest soap available. Plus there&#39;s a satisfaction that comes from<br/>
making soap from scratch that doesn&#39;t come from melting premade chunks<br/>
and mixing them with fragrances. And kids stand to learn so much from<br/>
the &quot;from scratch&quot; process - safety, chemistry, crafts, I could go<br/>
on...<br/>
<br/>
Not putting your suggestion down, just adding my own thoughts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If that&#39;s what the kids want to do.<br/>
<br/>
My 15yo started learning to cook by making jello. No kidding, <br/>
straight from the box. He even made it in the microwave. Making <br/>
something from scratch was too intimidating to him for a loooooooong <br/>
time. Now he cooks from scratch and is starting to bake, but it all <br/>
started with a box of lime jello. <br/>
<br/>
My 7yo, otoh, came to me one day, about a year ago, and asked how to <br/>
set the oven to 350 degrees. Why? She&#39;d pulled a cookbook down, <br/>
found a cake recipe and made it. She&#39;s not intimidated by much. She <br/>
loves to bake, and will invent her own recipes, but she&#39;s not <br/>
interested in cooking unless its mac-n-cheese from a box. Something <br/>
magical about that.<br/>
<br/>
From a radical unschooling perspective, its important to *not* go <br/>
into projects with kids with an agenda around learning. Because its <br/>
impossible to know exactly what another person is learning from a <br/>
given activity - heck sometimes *I* don&#39;t know what I&#39;ve learned <br/>
until later. I have no idea when I learned to carve, for example. I <br/>
suspect from hand-quilting, but can&#39;t say for sure. I *am* sure that <br/>
the lady who taught me to quilt didn&#39;t have &quot;carving skills&quot; on the <br/>
learning plan, though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;One could do just that...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It helps a whole lot, both in terms of seeing the learning that <br/>
happens in everyday things, and in valuing the joy we see even when <br/>
we can&#39;t see the learning, to step away from statements like this in <br/>
our minds. When we de-value something our kids want to do by <br/>
say &quot;just that&quot; we miss the value our kids see. I want to see the <br/>
value my kids see! Even if - maybe especially if - its not something <br/>
I would have thought to value, myself. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248564550">It depends on the age and maturity level of the small kids too.<br/>
Additionally, it also will depend on how closely the parent or<br/>
&quot;teacher&quot; is willing to monitor the kids.<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah. A lot of things have to be taken into consideration when making soap.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s almost like cooking with small kids. Y&#39;know? I was once cooking<br/>
with my very small son (the elder son who is now 12) when he decided<br/>
he wanted to know what that bright red thing that I kept putting pots<br/>
and pans on was. He reached out to show me. I was closer than arm&#39;s<br/>
length away, mind. Time stood still at that moment and I could not<br/>
catch his hand fast enough. He actually touched with his pointer<br/>
finger a glowing hot electric burner (aka &quot;hot stove&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
See what I&#39;m saying? *Any*thing can be very dangerous without proper<br/>
precautions, and even with those precautions bad things can still<br/>
happen - soapmaking, cooking, baking, wood working, etc...<br/>

All of this is very true, but please bear in mind that he probably <br/>
recovered very well from that burn. One of my classmates at Guide <br/>
Dogs for the Blind (long story, and no, I am no longer blind) never <br/>
saw again since the lye she was using just happened to splash back up <br/>
into her face. She&#39;s a nurse and she has personally seen what lye can <br/>
do. But even with her best intentions, an &quot;accident&quot; did happen and <br/>
she paid for it with her eyesight.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a duty as parents to protect her children and even if my <br/>
daughter were the most cautious person in the world, that is one <br/>
thing that I&#39;d call off limits.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, yeah. A lot of things have to be taken into consideration when <br/>
&gt;making soap.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s almost like cooking with small kids. Y&#39;know? I was once cooking<br/>
&gt;with my very small son (the elder son who is now 12) when he decided<br/>
&gt;he wanted to know what that bright red thing that I kept putting pots<br/>
&gt;and pans on was. He reached out to show me. I was closer than arm&#39;s<br/>
&gt;length away, mind. Time stood still at that moment and I could not<br/>
&gt;catch his hand fast enough. He actually touched with his pointer<br/>
&gt;finger a glowing hot electric burner (aka &quot;hot stove&quot;).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;See what I&#39;m saying? *Any*thing can be very dangerous without proper<br/>
&gt;precautions, and even with those precautions bad things can still<br/>
&gt;happen - soapmaking, cooking, baking, wood working, etc...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899576752">*All* soap in made starting from a very precise mixture of lye and <br/>
oils even glycerine soap starts from lye and is processed down with <br/>
high ammounts of alcohol and cooked down until it takes on a clear <br/>
form. If someone tells you soap can be made without lye they are <br/>
seriously mistaken. <br/>
<br/>
But, glycerine soap also known as melt and pour is the same kind you <br/>
see in craft stores that you can melt down and add colors, fragrance, <br/>
etc then pour into moulds, etc. as craft projects. Melt and Pour is a <br/>
great craft and learning tool (hygene, science (solid, liquid), color <br/>
theory, etc.) You definatly could incorporate learning about how soap <br/>
in made traditionally and eventually results in the glycerine soap <br/>
you and your children can safely craft with. I have a shortened to <br/>
the point explaination (on the &quot;About Us&quot; page under FAQ&#39;s at <br/>
www.kissingmoons.com) on my website on how soap is made, History of <br/>
Castille soap, what is in commercial soaps and how it is different <br/>
from traditional handcraftred soap, etc if you would like to use that <br/>
information. More detailed information can be found at the website <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789451057">LOL! I have been crafting soap for years and I still suit up. DH thinks <br/>
I look halarious and knows what I am up to as soon as I pull out the <br/>
gloves and set gallon of vinegar near the sink. I am actually about to <br/>
have to go into overdrive pretty soon because I committed to setting up <br/>
a booth at a womens conference in April.<br/>
<br/>
I have been sitting here thinking because of all the discussion on how <br/>
I can include the kids in this since I will be very busy the next few <br/>
months getting ready for this. I was thinking that a great way to <br/>
include the kids would be to have a scent making session and have them <br/>
help by creating their very own fragrance for a special batch of soap. <br/>
We could discuss fragrances and how each makes them feel, what it <br/>
smells like, what the combinations make them think of, why they like <br/>
it, etc... I think it sounds like fun.<br/>

At this year&#39;s conference, my parents came for the first time. My father, after sitting through three or four speeches, said that he thought the most important ingredient in this unschooling schtick was that the parents need to be smart.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I laughed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He was dead serious.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;ingredient&quot; HE seemed to be missing is that a parent doesn&#39;t even enter IN to such a venture without giving it a lot of thought. It *takes* a lot of thought to be an unschooling parent. It takes *more* though to STAY an unschooling parent! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I truly think it&#39;s safe to assume, with this crowd, that they will think it through a bit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have done lots of, seemingly to others, dangerous things. Horses, bees, sky-diving, laying tile, ...cooking and driving! &lt;G&gt; But I never did any without thinking about my and my family&#39;s safety.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of risks. This is NOT a &quot;go-into-it-blindly&quot; crowd.<br/>

<br/>
Well dang. I agree with him. Not smart as in<br/>
containing-a-certain-body-of-knowledge, but willingness to learn, to<br/>
be curious and have that certain sparkly energy (which LOOKS quiet in<br/>
some people but is bubbling underneath all the same).<br/>
<br/>
The really great unschoolers I know are not some dullards waiting<br/>
around for life to happen. They are grabbing life by the horns and<br/>
DANCING with it. Even when life gets rough, there is a certain<br/>
embracing of it all and the curiosity is remains. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well holy schmoly I haven&#39;t been offline in years because of all the<br/>
unschooling research I&#39;m doing.  I am not going blinding into it.  I want to<br/>
*know* what I&#39;m doing.<br/>
<br/>
Others aren&#39;t likely to be doing much unschooling if they&#39;re uncommitted to<br/>
knowing what it is.  What they&#39;re doing is something else with a thought or<br/>
two of unschooling here and there.<br/>

<br/>
I love to invite my kids to join my fun. But they&#39;re busy people <br/>
with their own projects going on all the time, so more often I&#39;m the <br/>
one joining in on their projects, doing a little extra reading or <br/>
prep for them, maybe, or going along for the ride if they&#39;d rather. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an implication, there, that parents have to create projects <br/>
or make a special effort to spend time with children. Its an <br/>
expectation that comes from more conventional parenting, where kid <br/>
life is largely separate from adult life.<br/>
<br/>
That may be the case if you&#39;re still deschooling, but longtime <br/>
radical unschoolers are doing things with our kids all the time, <br/>
whether its making something or watching tv or playing a computer <br/>
game or reading Lego Club magazine or gardening or.... you get the <br/>
idea. My kids are pretty independent, but I and my partner move in <br/>
and out of their company all day long, checking in, touching base, <br/>
taking time to connect and hang out and chit chat, or jump on the <br/>
trampoline, or share a snack, or work on a project, or play <br/>
together. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tend to avoid calling things &quot;off limits&quot; around my kids. I look <br/>
for ways to make what they want to do safer. <br/>
<br/>
When Mo was 3, for example, we made candy. If you&#39;ve never made <br/>
candy, the liquid sugar solution gets up above the boiling point of <br/>
water, and its sticky, so getting it on your skin is Bad. Its not <br/>
the safest activity for a 3yo, but she wanted to make hard candy so <br/>
we talked about the safety factors and she agreed to stay out of the <br/>
range of being splashed and just watch. It turned out to be less <br/>
exciting than she had hoped, and I ended up drizzling most of the <br/>
candy solution into containers of cold water and making &quot;candy <br/>
string&quot; rather than the lollipops we had been anticipating. <br/>
<br/>
If I had a kid who wanted to try lye soap, I&#39;d probably look for a <br/>
movie on the subject, first, since my kids are pretty visual. I&#39;d <br/>
want them to know the steps involved, talk about safety and <br/>
precautions and make some firm agreements in that area. I might look <br/>
for another adult who&#39;d done it before to walk us through the <br/>
process or just let us watch sometime. Eventually we might even make <br/>
our own soap! But I wouldn&#39;t be attatched to that outcome, since my <br/>
kids don&#39;t tend to take well to lots of preparations before actually <br/>
doing anything. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;d *set up* a lot of obstacles <br/>
between talking and doing, but I&#39;d take the safety issue seriously, <br/>
all the while saying &quot;yes, yes, yes, lets make soap!&quot;<br/>
