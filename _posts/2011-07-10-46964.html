<div id="ygrps-yiv-463858501">I have many thoughts, but am too tired to post them at the moment – I just wanted to share one bit of info that I *wish* I had had when my daughter (now 16) was around 11 and 12 – and that is that as girls approach puberty, they gain, on average, something like 30-40 POUNDS. this can be quite alarming to them, and to parents, especially in a culture that values thinness at every turn.  it’s normal, healthy, and their bodies are preparing for menstruation and growth.  <br/>
<br/>
also, you might want to look into the “health at an size” campaign.  largeness of body does not have anything to do with health, directly. there are plenty of large people who are very healthy and plenty of thin ones who are not.<br/>
<br/>
how do they express not liking their body size?  you say they are very active.  is there any reason to believe they are eating for emotional comfort/boredom reasons rather than appetite?  growing pre/teens often have pretty large appetites!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165986019">11 is a big growth period. Have you gone to a conference, or anywhere with lots <br/>
of kids of varying ages? Look for the prepubescent kids, they are rounder <br/>
(often) then the rest of the kids. It takes a lot of energy, particularly for <br/>
girls, to power through puberty. It&#39;s easy to flash onto this point that they <br/>
are getting too fat. Linnaea has put weight on and then put height on. She&#39;s <br/>
taller than a lot of girls her age now. I&#39;m tall, I figure she&#39;ll be tall as <br/>
well. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Back off and breathe. Don&#39;t worry about it too much. They are at an age when <br/>
their bodies are changing enormously. Try and think about something that you <br/>
really worried about when they were 3 or 4 and see how irrelevant it is now. <br/>

In what way? That&#39;s important. If they&#39;re saying &quot;ugly&quot; than focus on helping them feel more beautiful. That could include shopping for clothes which are flattering and emphasize their curves - are you up for buying them clothes that look &quot;sexy&quot; if that will help them feel better about how they look?<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re saying &quot;unhealthy&quot; then help them take a look at their lifestyle and see what could be healthier - but please don&#39;t start with food! Start with activity and energy and wind - as in, if one of them gets out of breath going up stairs, would she like some kind of exercise to improve her wind? Would she like to take an aerobics class or get a treadmill or stair-climber? <br/>

If they eat when they&#39;re hungry and stop when they&#39;re no longer hungry, then &quot;a serving&quot; isn&#39;t really all that relevant. If they&#39;re used to having food regulated and will tend to overeat as a result, then its worth talking about smaller servings. <br/>

Why do you thing that&#39;s bad? Is it that you&#39;ve been stuffed full of theories about how and when people &quot;should&quot; eat? I know there&#39;s one idea that eating before bed is bad. Any food theory is only ever going to work for *some* people - there&#39;s too much variation in human needs in that regard. <br/>

thanks for the reminder. I think you mentioned it to me once before. I guess I need it knocked into my head. I&#39;ll look into that. It&#39;s a busy week so I don&#39;t have as much computer time, but that will be first on my list. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They hate clothes, mainly I think because we can&#39;t find any that fit. They don&#39;t have breasts yet and like their shirts big. They often make comments about being too fat and ugly. I don&#39;t think they eat for emotional comfort but boredom may be an issue. They don&#39;t eat much as long as they are outside playing but it almost non-stop when they come in for the evening. It may be that they are trying to make up for not eating much during the day, or it may be that they are &quot;bored&quot; watching TV and playing in the house. <br/>

We have been to a conference and most of the girls their age were much smaller, both in height and weight. But I needed to be reminded that I&#39;ll look back someday and this won&#39;t be a big deal.<br/>

when they are playing out during the day which may make them less likely to eat <br/>

looks so much larger than the rest of the girls in the drama class she&#39;s in. <br/>
Well, not so much larger, but definitely further up the growth chart. She <br/>
doesn&#39;t have any issue with it. She really likes the way she looks. I really <br/>
like the way she looks and how comfortable she is with who she is. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My dad has always been a public commenter on body size. My body size got a lot <br/>
of commentary. It probably made me more aware of Linnaea&#39;s body size. But I&#39;ve <br/>
successfully not made it my issue. It&#39;s her body. It&#39;s got nothing to do with <br/>
me. Honestly. <br/>

I&#39;ll buy anything they are interested in but they aren&#39;t interested because they can&#39;t find clothes that fit. Mostly they wear big, baggy men&#39;s clothes to feel comfortable. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like that story, Jill. I think that is the approach how things always work out. In this example, it is not the body that has to be changed, but the thought about oneself, and about food, that must change. And the thought that allows peace, will solve things in one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, Bonni, you cannot change your daughters, the way they look, think and do. But, you can change your thought about them. And who they are cannot be put in terms of body weight. one pound more or less, does not make them more or less themselves. Holding in thought their true individual character, will show their original nature and form.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you sew at all? I got into sewing as a teen because I couldn&#39;t find clothes that I liked which fit me. It still irritates me that there are *much* cuter clothes available in smaller sizes, but I make that into an asset as much as I can, altering clothes in interesting ways, or making clothes that are quirky just for me. <br/>
<br/>
It has also helped me, as a white woman, to look at styles popular among women of other ethnic backgrounds, which are a little more accepting of robust, sturdy, and curvaceous figures. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;all their friends are much smaller and make fun of them for being heavy<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d work on stepping away from thinking of this as &quot;a food issue&quot; and seeing it as a discrimination issue. How do you talk with your kids about homeschooling - another area where they likely experience some discrimination? It could help to think in those terms. <br/>

&gt; I&#39;m struggling right now with food issues in our home with both of my girls. They are 11, and I do not control their food. I try to get things that they ask for if they are not already in the house. I don&#39;t limit amount and I don&#39;t set a time. On the other hand, I don&#39;t usually fix a separate meal if they don&#39;t eat at dinner time with the rest of the house. I will fix a micro meal, reheat leftovers or a fix a sandwich but not a full course meal like we had earlier. (They usually will come in close to when the  meal is served unless they are having too much fun playing with friends.)We keep a variety of foods including veggies, fruit and some junk food (mini candy bars and SF popsicles, for example) My struggle is that both girls are on the large size (5&#39;1&quot; 150ish pounds)and are unhappy about it. (They are big boned girls) I don&#39;t want to make an issue of it, but I don&#39;t want their self-esteem or health to suffer either. It seems they are eating constantly lately. Last night, they each had 2 coconut popsicles near bed time after having had dinner an hour or so earlier. I don&#39;t think they really understand how much they eat and what a serving actually is. They are very active most of the time. I think some of the extra eating is trying to compensate for dehydration. They hate to drink much except soda and we don&#39;t keep it in the house all the time. (Can&#39;t afford too.) Please help me work through how to deal with this. Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094020029">I&#39;m currently working on my Masters in Clinical Mental Health and one of my<br/>
areas of interest is eating disorders.  (Of course because I have these<br/>
tendencies.)  Eating disordered attitudes -- are those thoughts and<br/>
behaviors which indicate an unhealthy attitude towards food, the body and<br/>
two big screaming red flags of personal &quot;damage&quot; -- low self esteem and<br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
Low self-esteem seems self explanatory for this issue, &quot;hate yourself = hate<br/>
your body&quot; but control?  If you&#39;ve never had EDA or studied it, you might<br/>
not realize how important control is as an activating event.  If you can&#39;t<br/>
control anything else in your life, you can control what you put in your<br/>
mouth, or what you keep in your body to metabolize.  This is very similar to<br/>
struggles parents have with toddlers on potty training.  They can&#39;t control<br/>
anything else in their lives, but if you think you can make them poop on the<br/>
potty...you&#39;ve got another thing coming.<br/>
<br/>
It is an interesting issue to me that women are willing to blame the media<br/>
for the unhealthy &quot;ideal&quot; woman or Barbie, or whatever else, but it&#39;s FAR<br/>
less about that and much more about cognitive schema and control issues for<br/>
most women with EDA.  It may be helpful to show the girls the Dove company&#39;s<br/>
campaign for real beauty materials.  This one is especially good<br/>

<br/>
Just 1:15 long, it will leave a lasting impression.<br/>
<br/>
However, more important is not setting up unrealistic ideals for your kids.<br/>
One example I have from my kids and I is about sex.  My boys are almost 15<br/>
and almost 13 years old.  I do not delude myself.  At their age I was a<br/>
raging ball of hormones.  (I did not have sex the first time until 2 weeks<br/>
before my 18th birthday, ironically that was a Good Friday and I was an<br/>
Irish Catholic at the time, and I was date raped.)  But I digress...I do not<br/>
preach to my sons about abstinence.  I tell them &quot;Don&#39;t get anyone<br/>
pregnant.&quot;  I believe they will do what they will do for themselves when<br/>
it&#39;s right for them.  (My 13 yr old&#39;s &quot;girlfriend&quot; lives in the UK so there<br/>
is little that is going to happen there.)  But I don&#39;t believe they have the<br/>
&quot;right&quot; to hurt others.  And teenage pregnancy is a tragedy for the BABY.  I<br/>
don&#39;t &quot;care&quot; about anyone else involved frankly.  So, anyway, the &quot;advice&quot; I<br/>
hope they take to heart is about the devastation to the infant.<br/>
<br/>
So, back to your daughters.  If you preach to them about this food or that<br/>
being &quot;unhealthy&quot; you will lose that battle.  In point of fact you can find<br/>
many examples of people who &quot;eat healthy&quot; who are not healthy at all.  Lance<br/>
Armstrong comes to mind though he may have brought about his cancer by<br/>
steroid usage.  I don&#39;t know.  I also know there are 100+ yr old men living<br/>
in Afghanistan who do not &quot;eat healthy&quot; and yet are long lived.  So do watch<br/>
what you say and what you demonstrate.   Anything you do that removes their<br/>
sense of control over their lives, including restriction of food choice, ups<br/>
the risk of EDA or full blown ED.<br/>
<br/>
Some quick facts about eating disorders:<br/>
<br/>
*PREVALENCE*<br/>
<br/>
   - It is estimated that 8 million Americans have an eating disorder �<br/>
   seven million women and one million men<br/>
   - One in 200 American women suffers from anorexia<br/>
   - Two to three in 100 American women suffers from bulimia<br/>
   - Nearly half of all Americans personally know someone with an eating<br/>
   disorder (Note: One in five Americans suffers from mental illnesses.)<br/>
   - An estimated 10 � 15% of people with anorexia or bulimia are males<br/>
<br/>
 *MORTALITY RATES *<br/>
<br/>
   - Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness<br/>
   - A study by the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated<br/>
   Disorders reported that 5 � 10% of anorexics die within 10 years after<br/>
   contracting the disease; 18-20% of anorexics will be dead after 20 years and<br/>
   only 30 � 40% ever fully recover<br/>
   - *The mortality rate associated with anorexia nervosa is 12 times higher<br/>
   than the death rate of ALL causes of death for females 15 � 24 years old.<br/>
   *<br/>
   - 20% of people suffering from anorexia will prematurely die from<br/>
   complications related to their eating disorder, including suicide and heart<br/>
   problems<br/>
<br/>
*ACCESS TO TREATMENT *<br/>
<br/>
   - Only 1 in 10 people with eating disorders receive treatment<br/>
   - About 80% of the girls/women who have accessed care for their eating<br/>
   disorders do not get the intensity of treatment they need to stay in<br/>
   recovery � they are often sent home weeks earlier than the recommended stay<br/>
   - Treatment of an eating disorder in the US ranges from $500 per day to<br/>
   $2,000 per day. The average cost for a month of inpatient treatment is<br/>
   $30,000. It is estimated that individuals with eating disorders need<br/>
   anywhere from 3 � 6 months of inpatient care. Health insurance companies for<br/>
   several reasons do not typically cover the cost of treating eating disorders<br/>
<br/>
   - The cost of outpatient treatment, including therapy and medical<br/>
   monitoring, can extend to $100,000 or more<br/>
<br/>
*ADOLESCENTS*<br/>
<br/>
   - Anorexia is the 3rd most common chronic illness among adolescents<br/>
   - 95% of those who have eating disorders are between the ages of 12 and<br/>
   25<br/>
   - 50% of girls between the ages of 11 and 13 see themselves as overweight<br/>
<br/>
   - 80% of 13-year-olds have attempted to lose weight<br/>
<br/>
*RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES*<br/>
<br/>
   - Rates of minorities with eating disorders are similar to those of white<br/>
   women<br/>
   - 74% of American Indian girls reported dieting and purging with diet<br/>
   pills<br/>
   - Essence magazine, in 1994, reported that 53.5% of their respondents,<br/>
   African-American females were at risk of an eating disorder<br/>
   - Eating disorders are one of the most common psychological problems<br/>
   facing young women in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Given these numbers, the average cost of treatment for an eating disorder is<br/>
over $280K and it is statistically not likely to work.  When faced with<br/>
that...what would you rather have your daughters do -- drink soda or develop<br/>
AN?<br/>
<br/>
I want to share some other thing here which I do not to frighten or punish<br/>
anyone.  But I&#39;d like to let you into my head a little.  Let you know what<br/>
it&#39;s like to live a life once these cognitive schema have taken root.  I did<br/>
not write this, but it could have been written by me.  I weigh myself 7<br/>
times a day on a good day.  I have a scale which measures my weight to the<br/>
.01 of a lb.  (And I don&#39;t get rid of the scale because I&#39;m working on NOT<br/>
weighing to eliminate the drive. Not having access to it would be both going<br/>
&quot;cold turkey&quot; and wouldn&#39;t allow me to change my maladaptive schema.)<br/>
<br/>
The site on which this appears proclaims that AN is a lifestyle, not a<br/>
disease and enjoins the reader to &quot;suck it in harder&quot;... both sad and<br/>
terrifying.  And I live this each day, the fight between these thoughts and<br/>
what I know to be a more healthy way to live.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ANA Creed<br/>
<br/>
I believe in Control, the only force mighty enough to bring order to the<br/>
chaos that is my world.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that I am the most vile, worthless and useless person ever to have<br/>
existed on this planet, and that I am totally unworthy of anyone&#39;s time and<br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that other people who tell me differently must be idiots. If they<br/>
could see how I really am, then they would hate me almost as much as I do.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in oughts, musts and shoulds as unbreakable laws to determine my<br/>
daily behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in perfection and strive to attain it.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in salvation through trying just a bit harder than I did<br/>
yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in calorie counters as the inspired word of g_d, and memorize them<br/>
accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in bathroom scales as an indicator of my daily successes and<br/>
failures<br/>
<br/>
I believe in hell, because I sometimes think that I&#39;m living in it.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in a wholly black and white world, the losing of weight,<br/>
recrimination for sins, the abnegation of the body and a life ever fasting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And this:<br/>
<br/>
Ana Psalm<br/>
<br/>
Strict is my diet. I must not want.<br/>
It maketh me to lie down at night hungry.<br/>
It leadeth me past the confectioners.<br/>
It trieth my willpower.<br/>
It leadeth me in the paths of alteration for my figure&#39;s sake.<br/>
Yea, though I walk through the aisles of the pastry department, I will buy<br/>
no sweet rolls for they are fattening.<br/>
The cakes and the pies, they tempt me.<br/>
Before me is a table set with green beans and lettuce.<br/>
I filleth my stomach with liquids,<br/>
My day&#39;s quota runneth over.<br/>
Surely calorie and weight charts will follow me all the days of my life,<br/>
And I will dwell in the fear of the scales forever.<br/>
<br/>
