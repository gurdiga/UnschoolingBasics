<div id="ygrps-yiv-832274573">I read a post from someone in LA considering a move, but can&#39;t seem to locate the post again. I&#39;ve been working this week, so I don&#39;t have much time and my brain is overtaxed at this point!:)<br/>
I just wanted to put a bid out there for Pensacola. We aren&#39;t TOO far from Louisianna and I&#39;m intent on creating an unschooling haven here....so far it&#39;s working out fairly well. Our inclusive group has several unschoolers, plus some school at homers (doh!) that are open minded. So come on over this way, we&#39;ll take ya.<br/>
