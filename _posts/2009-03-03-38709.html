<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814110867">This sounds like a wonderful opportunity for unschoolers! I just got  <br/>
that in a newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany<br/>
Johanna<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When I studied at NYU&#39;s Film School in the early 90&#39;s, there were  <br/>
things I really loved about it: detailed feedback from film literate  <br/>
professors, hanging out with a few ambitious fellow film students,  <br/>
etc.. And things that bothered me: bureaucracy, EXTREMELY expensive  <br/>
tuition, etc... And being a guy who had already made 50 short film  <br/>
experiments with friends before I turned 18, I knew there must be a  <br/>
way to support the do-it-yourself path while still getting the fruits  <br/>
of experienced filmmaker feedback and inspired camaraderie.<br/>
<br/>
And after researching different models of on-line education programs,  <br/>
I&#39;ve finally realized this dream of mine can come true by creating my  <br/>
own On-Line Mentorship Program for Maverick Filmmakers.<br/>
<br/>
On March 16, we&#39;re launching a 4-week Beta Session where students from  <br/>
all over the world will be personally guided in creating 2 short film  <br/>
experiments, 1 larger short, or maybe even moving forward on a  <br/>
feature. Students can get support in: writing, producing, directing,  <br/>
editing, and/or marketing their work.<br/>
<br/>
The connections will happen 4 times per week, on-line, via: web cam,  <br/>
conference calls, and e-mail groups. Each student will be given in- <br/>
depth attention to set concrete personal goals - a process they can  <br/>
turn into a habit, keeping them consistently productive the rest of  <br/>
their lives. Every week, students will share work and receive  <br/>
gracefully honest feedback . All this happens among a small number of  <br/>
inspired peers - an electric group atmosphere that&#39;s both competitive  <br/>
and genuinely friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody 16 years old and up with a burning desire to make or write  <br/>
films is welcome to apply. They just need access to the web, the  <br/>
ingenuity to get their hands on a camera and editing software, and the  <br/>
drive to move to the next level of their career, no matter what.  For  <br/>
those who simply want to write films, they just need to be able to get  <br/>
on-line.<br/>
<br/>
To get more details, shoot us an e-mail: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Brooks@...">Brooks@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the Beta Session only costs $1! Before I charge premium  <br/>
prices, I want to get a feel for how it&#39;s working, get feedback, and   <br/>
then fine tune it. So spread the word to the aspiring filmmakers you  <br/>
know because this program will get to their next level!  So spread the  <br/>
word&quot;</div>
