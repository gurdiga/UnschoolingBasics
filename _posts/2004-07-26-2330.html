<div id="ygrps-yiv-3027747">Hi all, I just might be getting the hang of this and thought I would share<br/>
for your reflection,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know about our Saturday, well Sunday we had a quiet day as well, just at<br/>
home and dd spent time on the computer again at Pollypocket.com etc. Then we<br/>
went to the circus in the evening with friends, and everyone had a great<br/>
time. When we got home from the circus, it was 9pm, which is usually the<br/>
time I try to get her into bed, but decided that I was just too beat and my<br/>
feet were too swollen to make the effort to do bedtime, so told her she<br/>
could stay up until I went to sleep too. So she was up later and slept in a<br/>
bit and then today I just felt like I was getting an ear infection and that<br/>
might explain how tired I have been. So we had a lazy morning, then went out<br/>
for a few groceries and when we came home I set her up with pollypocket.com<br/>
again while I had a lay down and then she watched TV. Later in the afternoon<br/>
I went out to pick peas for supper, she happily came with me not at my<br/>
suggestion, I just said I was going and she wanted to come. Then I went out<br/>
and sat on the deck and she came out and wanted to skip rope. Well her idea<br/>
of rope skipping has been for me to spin in and her to jump *near* it not in<br/>
it:-)  So today I said how about we learn how properly and so she said yes<br/>
and we spent a really happy time with her jumping rope. Slowly for sure but<br/>
whenever I said jump she did and she is now getting it. We laughed and had<br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now she is helping her dad make supper (I asked him to cause I was so tired<br/>
so I am doing email - see I am learning) and again, no fights, no stress<br/>
just a wonderful loving day. I am liking this! The days are peaceful. I had<br/>
moments of guilt this afternoon while I rested, but I shooed them away<br/>
eventually.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My personal issue now is that if I am home, I find I am bored easily. I tend<br/>
to fall into the trap of vegging in front of the TV instead of doing most<br/>
anything else, except computer. I hear about when you are all at home you<br/>
are doing crafts or reading or gardening or some other fantastic hobby or<br/>
interest you have and I can&#39;t seem to get up the gumption to do it. It is<br/>
like, if I am at home it is total down time otherwise we are out doing,<br/>
there is no happy medium. I think this might come from my restaurant<br/>
management days, when I was out working or partying, and then eventually<br/>
came home to recoup. But those days are gone and I don&#39;t seem to be able to<br/>
figure out how to change the pattern. I have plenty of interests, lots of<br/>
things I would like to know or know how to do but seem to be unable to take<br/>
the interest to any sort of completion. I thought I wanted to do scrap<br/>
booking, so took a course and got all the supplies and did one page and<br/>
there it sits. Thought I wanted to knit and took a course and got the<br/>
supplies and there it sits. This is not a new thing for me, I have lots of<br/>
interests, but get stalled in the learning stage, want to go straight to<br/>
mastery I think. Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all your support!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229781960">Hi Sherri-Lee - I&#39;m so glad to hear you&#39;re letting yourself get what you<br/>
need, and that your daughter&#39;s happy, and that your dh left the cave long<br/>
enough to make dinner &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I have lots of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>interests, but get stalled in the learning stage, want to go straight to<br/>
mastery I think. Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
**I used to feel the same way, and I tried a bunch of things like you<br/>
described - knitting and pottery and all sorts of others.  Pretty much<br/>
anything that crossed my path.  I think for me it was part of the process of<br/>
opening myself up to having a passion.  For a while none of the things I<br/>
tried held my interest.  But the more things I tried the more I enjoyed<br/>
trying things just for the sake of learning even a little bit.  Seeing my<br/>
kids just jump in and try anything that seemed interesting and dropping it<br/>
when it wasn&#39;t was very helpful for me.<br/>
<br/>
When jewelry making came along I think I was at just the right place to grab<br/>
on and go with it.  I had learned that there was value for me in dabbling. I<br/>
had learned that becoming proficient in something takes time (I don&#39;t think<br/>
I&#39;ll ever &#39;master&#39; it.  There&#39;s always more to learn, and that&#39;s a huge part<br/>
of the fun.) and I had learned that I wasn&#39;t interested in putting that time<br/>
into just anything.   One day I announced to Jon that I felt ready to find<br/>
&#39;the&#39; way to express myself, and very shortly thereafter I found it.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t stop dabbling.  It&#39;s ok if you think scrapbooking is it and then it<br/>
collects dust (although in that case I usually hand the supplies over to my<br/>
kids :0) ).  You won&#39;t find &#39;it&#39; unless you keep that part of yourself open<br/>
to seeing it.<br/>

<br/>
So familiar! All of this, except in my case it was life in the theater<br/>
rather than restaurant industry.<br/>
<br/>
One of the phrases in Sandra&#39;s empowerment certificate says that you have<br/>
the freedom to begin and cease any and all projects with the right to return<br/>
to them one day or never. The idea that merely beginning some project<br/>
automatically mandates completion of it is probably a leftover schoolthink.<br/>
That is when kids have so little time for their own stuff, what with<br/>
homework and essays and required reading, that none can afford to be wasted<br/>
on things that are simply experimental forays into possible future<br/>
interests. It doesn&#39;t have to still apply to us or our kids.<br/>
<br/>
One thing though: if you genuinely suspect that you won&#39;t get back into any<br/>
of these crafty type things, tossing (or donating) the materials - what is<br/>
actually nothing but clutter - will free you from the guilt of having them<br/>
&quot;hanging over you&quot;. Believe me, I have found getting it out of the house is<br/>
the best way to get it out of mind also. BTW &quot;donating&quot; can also apply to<br/>
giving the items to the kids for some other creative use.<br/>
<br/>
Vegging out in front of the tv, or the crossword, or the light romance<br/>
novel, or the garden bed full of weeds, or laps in the swimming pool, or the<br/>
computer Solitaire, in some ways is like taking a nap and sometimes a<br/>
meditation. The conscious mind is at most lightly engaged and the emotions<br/>
also get a chance to relax. Maybe the subconscious is doing some processing.<br/>
If you read Jane Austen, you may start feeling that it is imperative to have<br/>
busy hands, like crocheting or knitting or quilting or mending while<br/>
relaxing. I say only if you really do enjoy those activities or really need<br/>
the mending done. Nor is this veg-out time necessarily the time that you<br/>
would be putting towards your passion-hobby in a fully emotionally and<br/>
intellectually engaged way, especially if you are physically tired. Chances<br/>
are you would still want to have periods of doing nothing (some call it<br/>
consolidation) in between periods of busy activities. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that just before a baby is due is the time when those of us<br/>
with hobbies we love necessarily discovered them. Personally I spent a good<br/>
deal of that time, when not reading child care and birthing books,<br/>
contemplating my navel, and reveling the excuse to do so. <br/>
<br/>
Going out onto a limb, as usual, I want to suggest to you that this<br/>
concentrating on the &quot;shoulds&quot; is part of a pattern you have shown us of<br/>
being really hard on yourself, and focusing on the negative - the not-done,<br/>
the mistake, the running mental litany of criticism installed by a parent or<br/>
some other authority figure. If you did have some immense enduring interest,<br/>
the danger would be that you would then feel guilty that it was being set<br/>
aside while you cared for your new baby and dd.<br/>
<br/>
One of the startling joys of Unschooling, is that we can give ourselves the<br/>
same freedom to enjoy life that we are so rigorously ensuring for our<br/>
children. It works in both directions - treating children with equal respect<br/>
for their capabilities, emotions and interests as we would treat another<br/>
beloved adult; and treating other adults and ourselves with the same freedom<br/>
to experiment, be playful, acknowledging our right to sometimes *appear*<br/>
unproductive, and explore diverse interests without needing to declare a<br/>
lifetime commitment to any of them.<br/>

<br/>
Whooohooo!~ Way to go Sherri! Sounds wonderful and &quot;just right&quot; to me.<br/>
<br/>
You know, sometimes we all talk about all our interests and bubbly fun things here, that maybe it paints a false picture of our lives. I mean, who wants to hear about all the time my kids and I spend watching tv, or just laying around or talking or eating or???<br/>
It&#39;s the interests and fun things that get talked about, but that certainly isn&#39;t 95% of our day!:)<br/>
In fact, we spend a lot of days just &quot;hanging out&quot; at home. I NEED those do-nuthin&#39; kinda days in order to feel energized about the things I DO love.<br/>
If you look over an entire month, you&#39;re still doing a lot, even with many down days. Sometimes I start feeling like all we do is hang out, watch tv, read books, play games etc... and then I look over a whole month and realize we really do neat things. Those are the things I talk about the most, but the majority of our time is spent close to home doing normal things like grocery shopping, gardening etc...<br/>
It&#39;s too hot here for me to enjoy the out of doors much right now, so we hibernate indoors a LOT.:)<br/>
When you come to the list and read from many different families and all the various interests, it&#39;s easy to feel like you aren&#39;t doing enough. Maybe we should start a &quot;down days at home&quot; thread to balance it out! lol<br/>
I use the bubbly interests and busy days as examples of how children learn outside of school, not to show people that we are constantly busy with projects and fun things....that&#39;s just not the case around here. Although with four children, there&#39;s automatically always SOMETHING going on.:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>***** Our down days at home hold some of my most precious memories. <br/>
They&#39;re the times when I was in the kitchen, the garden or just <br/>
reading a book and/or watching movies with Laurie. Lots of down <br/>
times in southern Louisiana - it&#39;s just too hot to do anything else. <br/>
If we had too many days in a row where things had to be done away <br/>
from home, Laurie would get grumpy and I&#39;d postpone anything else <br/>
that week. <br/>
<br/>
Down days at home are when Laurie learned best in her own way. Her <br/>
way of learning was immersion learning and having nothing to <br/>
distract her, she was able to dive into whatever she was interested <br/>
in and really concentrate.<br/>
<br/>
Even now, when Laurie only has the weekend off, she wants to be <br/>
home. Even going out to eat is too much of a production for her. She <br/>
wants to be home with no commitments and no plans. Chilling at the <br/>
computer or with a book, helping me in the kitchen or .... these <br/>
days... packing up her stuff to leave home. :-(<br/>
<br/>
I do have something to cling to. She&#39;s already planned all of <br/>
these &quot;cool weekends where you come to visit and we just hang out in <br/>
my apartment and you cook meals for me.&quot; &lt;g&gt;  I can&#39;t wait. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575536587">&quot;Down days at home are when Laurie learned best in her own way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My extremely introverted, emotionally intense daughter (5.9) has really<br/>
taught me the truth of Valerie&#39;s statement above and the value of being<br/>
home, not just occasionally, but the vast majority of the time!  Following<br/>
my dd&#39;s lead has meant honoring what is not just a preference, but a need,<br/>
for her, to be home.  I was so antsy at first, feeling like we &quot;should&quot; be<br/>
&quot;doing&quot; more, that I was depriving her somehow by not &quot;getting her out&quot;<br/>
etcetera.<br/>
<br/>
But after making myself witness HER and turn away from my internal voices,<br/>
and reassessing, I saw that home IS what she wants, it&#39;s where she feels<br/>
safe and comfortable to explore fully.  She has no boredom issues with<br/>
staying home all day and night for days on end.  (The only issues are my<br/>
balancing my own need to get out and my son&#39;s requests.)  She has an amazing<br/>
imagination and interest in everything (spent 30 minutes one morning<br/>
pondering the pull cord on the light, how did they MAKE it like that, why<br/>
did they make it like that, had so many theories before she even got out of<br/>
bed it made my head spin).  She gets her exercise on these days by running<br/>
races from room to room, jumping, spinning and flipping on the bed for ages<br/>
(&quot;Mom, come see my tricks on the bed!&quot;)  She has so many interests, it&#39;s<br/>
hard to keep track of them all (Ancient Egypt, Dinosaurs, the solar system<br/>
about which she asks questions that blow me away, any kind of animal<br/>
especially lizards right now and bugs, Dragons) and she explores most of<br/>
them from home.<br/>
<br/>
The times she wants to go out are times that she has a focused purpose.  For<br/>
instance, this summer she is determined to learn to swim on her own without<br/>
a vest or arm wings aiding her.  She&#39;d love to have a pool here in our yard<br/>
so she doesn&#39;t have to go far, but since we don&#39;t she wants to go out a lot<br/>
of days to find a pool.  What I find interesting is her personality of<br/>
intensity and focus.  While this is driving her she wants to spend all day,<br/>
every day at the pool.  She wakes up in the morning and checks the weather<br/>
to see if it&#39;s swimming weather.  Before swimming took over, she and her<br/>
brother were into the Usborne Young Puzzle books - when I say &quot;into&quot; I mean<br/>
we not only read all of them, we lived them.  She made card and other games<br/>
out of the characters, made costumes from her artcart to wear of the<br/>
characters, painted the characters, drew the characters with pencil, drew<br/>
them on the sidewalk with sidewalk chaulk, taped pieces of paper she drew on<br/>
together to make stories about the characters from these books.  Etcetera.<br/>
When the swimming phase ends, she&#39;ll move on to something with equal passion<br/>
and intensity.  I love that about her, and I&#39;ve come to see how home is her<br/>
safe base where she springs off from, regroups, and decides on the things<br/>
that move her out into the world at her own pace and due to her own<br/>
interests (unless we are compromising to get her brother and/or me out!).<br/>
<br/>
Today is rainy here so we&#39;re home instead of heading to a pool.  We spent<br/>
the morning creating and performing rescues for my kids&#39; spider man rescue<br/>
heroes.  Now they&#39;re watching Scooby Doo.  Little Bear plus my son&#39;s new<br/>
favorites, &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; on video and Dora&#39;s &quot;Pirate Adventure&quot; will<br/>
likely get asked for today also.  I&#39;d be surprised if they don&#39;t want to<br/>
re-read two Usborne Young Puzzle Adventure books we got from the library the<br/>
other day and who knows where that will lead to.  DD and her brother and<br/>
cousin turned the last few books into a &quot;play&quot; on the bed, so maybe I&#39;ll be<br/>
treated to a performance.  We&#39;ll be trying to glue dd&#39;s piggy bank which she<br/>
inadvertantly dropped yesterday back together.  And dd&#39;s been on a painting<br/>
spree lately and declared it one of her favorite things right now ... her<br/>
cousin was here yesterday and lost her first tooth here at our house (didn&#39;t<br/>
know they could come out so early, she&#39;s just turning 5!) and dd painted her<br/>
a picture of Daphne from Scooby to celebrate her tooth coming out.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, we spend the vast majority of our days like this at home, but<br/>
I&#39;d hardly call them &quot;down&quot;.  And in witnessing my dd operate from home,<br/>
I&#39;ve learned to get rid of all those shoulds and celebrate what makes us all<br/>
feel good which has been a big step toward joy for all of us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663189952">Just had to add one more thought that I forgot.  It&#39;s in reference to all<br/>
the talk about it being too hot to go out, which it often is!  Here&#39;s my<br/>
question.  If it&#39;s not too hot, not too cold, not too rainy, not too<br/>
anything, but is 75 degrees, not humid, perfect weather for going out, is it<br/>
&quot;bad&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;a waste&quot; to stay inside all day?<br/>
<br/>
I used to feel that it was a waste, that I was somehow &quot;failing&quot; in my duty<br/>
as a mother if we didn&#39;t get out on such days because there was &quot;no excuse&quot;.<br/>
But my daughter&#39;s personality and her will to stay inside have forced me to<br/>
challenge my thinking.  What I now think is that what IS a waste is me or<br/>
one of my kids sitting at the beach or the playground on a perfect weather<br/>
day feeling grumpy because what they WANT is to be home watching that new<br/>
exciting video we just got or finishing that pretend game mom interrupted to<br/>
get everyone out of the house before the youngest gets too tired or the<br/>
traffic coming back will be bad.  What is NOT a waste is staying inside and<br/>
feeling fulfilled and happy doing what you want and what answers the needs<br/>
inside of you even if the weather happens to be &quot;perfect&quot; outside.<br/>

 <br/>
I had a hard time with this, too.  Growing up, it seemed that unless it was raining buckets, my Mom&#39;s deal was to tell us it was &#39;too nice for kids to be indoors&#39; and shoo us outdoors.  We lived in Oklahoma, where it was always too hot and too humid in the summer, and yet there we were out after breakfast and not back until dusk.  <br/>
 <br/>
My kids will spend hours indoors, where I really need to get physically out of the house -- preferably out in the fresh air and sunshine -- some part of every day.  Andy seems to be in an indoors phase of late, so I solve this by either sitting at the patio table or in the driveway where I can watch Dan ride his bike while Andy communes with the TV set. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree, Joan, and I&#39;m still getting over this in my own head.  I can&#39;t <br/>
believe that July is almost over!  Here in MI it&#39;s cold so often that <br/>
we look forward to warm weather for most of the year and then once it&#39;s <br/>
here we stay inside in the AC because it&#39;s so dang humid and miserable. <br/>
  We went to a friend&#39;s house last week to sit in the yard and play in <br/>
the kiddie pool.  It was downright miserable -- ended up being 90+ <br/>
degrees that day -- and after not that long I told my friend that I <br/>
needed to go inside or we&#39;d have to leave because it was torturous to <br/>
me.   I did think guilty oh-you-baby-get-outside-and-enjoy-Summer but <br/>
that thought didn&#39;t last too long.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had a few cold days here (yesterday was only 61 and raining!) but <br/>
today is beautiful.  Am I outside?  Nope.  I&#39;m in the house cooking, <br/>
using the computer and cleaning.  The kids are using two different TVs <br/>
and nobody has asked me to help them get dressed so they can go <br/>
outside.  Seems like a waste of a day, but we&#39;re all enjoying <br/>
ourselves.  Hmmmm....<br/>

Hmmmm....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I never really thought about that way of thinking and getting a hold <br/>
on it.  It really is a frame of mind.  If we are doing what we want, <br/>
when we want, it really isn&#39;t a waste of a day.  Cool realization.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668872076">Hi Rue,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for this. I had never thought of it as dabbling believe it or not,<br/>
I thought of it as failure and as soon as I realized that I knew it came<br/>
from my mom. She didn&#39;t believe that you start anything and not finish it,<br/>
even if you hated it so much you were bleeding from the eyes. So perhaps<br/>
that is why I don&#39;t &quot;start&quot; as many things as I would like. interesting.<br/>
thanks again for the insight, you guys are just turning on so many light<br/>
bulbs for me it is amazing and exciting to see how I can change/reframe how<br/>
I see things and move forward!<br/>

<br/>
Hi Sherri-Lee - I&#39;m so glad to hear you&#39;re letting yourself get what you<br/>
need, and that your daughter&#39;s happy, and that your dh left the cave long<br/>
enough to make dinner &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I have lots of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>interests, but get stalled in the learning stage, want to go straight to<br/>
mastery I think. Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
**I used to feel the same way, and I tried a bunch of things like you<br/>
described - knitting and pottery and all sorts of others.  Pretty much<br/>
anything that crossed my path.  I think for me it was part of the process of<br/>
opening myself up to having a passion.  For a while none of the things I<br/>
tried held my interest.  But the more things I tried the more I enjoyed<br/>
trying things just for the sake of learning even a little bit.  Seeing my<br/>
kids just jump in and try anything that seemed interesting and dropping it<br/>
when it wasn&#39;t was very helpful for me.<br/>
<br/>
When jewelry making came along I think I was at just the right place to grab<br/>
on and go with it.  I had learned that there was value for me in dabbling. I<br/>
had learned that becoming proficient in something takes time (I don&#39;t think<br/>
I&#39;ll ever &#39;master&#39; it.  There&#39;s always more to learn, and that&#39;s a huge part<br/>
of the fun.) and I had learned that I wasn&#39;t interested in putting that time<br/>
into just anything.   One day I announced to Jon that I felt ready to find<br/>
&#39;the&#39; way to express myself, and very shortly thereafter I found it.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t stop dabbling.  It&#39;s ok if you think scrapbooking is it and then it<br/>
collects dust (although in that case I usually hand the supplies over to my<br/>
kids :0) ).  You won&#39;t find &#39;it&#39; unless you keep that part of yourself open<br/>
to seeing it.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816355576">I KNEW there was a reason for needing to read the list today!  I had <br/>
one of those moms, get outside, its SO nice out!  And I went, but <br/>
with me, I LOVED being out doors running free all day (summer only of <br/>
course, due to ps :(<br/>
  ANYWAY, I have been saying that to my own boys all summer long!  <br/>
I&#39;m glad to see mine are not the only ones who enjoy being indoors!  <br/>
Even though there is an awsome treehouse, a pond, horses, cats, dogs, <br/>
chickens and a pool, oh yes, and a sandbox, outside!  Oh gosh, now <br/>
saying that i&#39;m thinking, whats wrong with these boys!!!! lol !!!!!<br/>
  DS 11 is getting ready to work on the laptop.  Much to his grpas <br/>
dismay!  I just let him have at it, I&quot;m pretty sure its crashed, and <br/>
if it is, we&#39;ll reformat and start all over. <br/>
  Anyone out there been to a truck and tractor pull?  If you have, <br/>
what do you suppose a kid learns from all that?  Been wracking my <br/>
brain on this one for a few days.  Asking DS 11 , he learned that you <br/>
can put a jet engine in a tractor and having fun, wasn&#39;t thinking <br/>
about what he was learning.  But I was thinking of making it an <br/>
example to someone who is asking questions about unschooling, since <br/>
her son went with us.<br/>
  Our down days here are mostly TV, movies, pc, LOTS of roll playing <br/>
with gi joe. Movie ideas, acting out movies.  Reciting movie lines.   <br/>
And i have to admit, I have those times when I think, I&#39;ve got to get <br/>
them somewhere!  to a museum or something!  But they are so much <br/>
happier when we AREN&#39;T going somewhere, or doing something.  <br/>

 <br/>
Yes.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
History--  farms, farming equipment.<br/>
 <br/>
How about science -- pullies, force,  engine power, mechanics.<br/>
 <br/>
I know with most of the tractor pulls we&#39;ve been to, the people who are doing it all know how to service, build and rebuild their tractors.  What a great thing to show and share with a kid.   Here are these people totally excited about their equipment that they sometimes use in their line of work and it is also their hobby!  How cool and great examples for our children.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

But I had to point out,  they are doing something &lt;g&gt;<br/>

The above is a good reminder when we insist on making our children finish  <br/>

Much better to &quot;go with the fow&quot; and let them quit when they&#39;re done. The  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144586143">OH Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So right you are. I just realized, that so often something appeals to me and<br/>
I think I will just do it and then I say. nope I will wait and see if I am<br/>
still interested in it in 1 month or 6 months or a year and if I am then it<br/>
is a &quot;real&quot; interest and I probably won&#39;t give it up and so can justify<br/>
starting it. Because I have always felt so interested in SO many things! So<br/>
many I thought there was something wrong with me for not having one or two<br/>
interests. WOW. thank you!!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So my next question would be how do I start giving myself permission to just<br/>
DO something that intrigues me without proof of my long term interest?<br/>
