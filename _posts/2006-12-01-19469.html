<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238459717">I really want to get a handle on this but I don&#39;t know how. I have a<br/>
6yr old with some mild sensory integration issues. I&#39;m an early<br/>
intervention speech therapist so I noticed the issues very early on<br/>
and worked with him throughout the years. He&#39;s a twin, born at 31 wks<br/>
and had 2 brain bleeds as well. When he was younger, he had motor<br/>
planning and visual/auditory issues but these have pretty much<br/>
disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that is occuring now is his need to be touching me when we<br/>
are in public. I am not talking about holding my hand. I mean<br/>
literally being attached to me. If we are walking, he tends to put out<br/>
his elbow so that it&#39;s touching my leg. If we are standing still and<br/>
he&#39;s infront, he backs up until he can feel his head against me or he<br/>
will pull his elbows back to me. In the grocery store, he has the need<br/>
to hold the grocery cart and gets very anxious if he can&#39;t (he holds<br/>
the side and if another cart is trying to pass, he has to let go and<br/>
move away). This isn&#39;t about unfamiliar people, per se. It seems to be<br/>
more about his place in space (the sensory part of it). Like I said,<br/>
holding hands doesn&#39;t really help, as he is away from my body. <br/>
<br/>
I need to make clear that this is a kid who now has average motor<br/>
skills. He learned to ride a bike early and is beginning to roller<br/>
skate. He loves baseball and street hockey. So it&#39;s not motor<br/>
planning.  It&#39;s more his awareness in space and his need for external<br/>
confirmation. <br/>
<br/>
He has no problem going out and playing and there are times when he<br/>
will be atteched and all of a sudden just go off and go explore (ex.<br/>
in the museum today, he would go explore and then come right back to me). <br/>
<br/>
Any tips or experiences are appreciated. I don&#39;t let it show to him,<br/>
but it&#39;s really wearing on me. I love his hugs and holding his hand.<br/>
But the &quot;having an extra body attached to me&quot; is wearing on me... <br/>

There are other sources, I just googled these two. We&#39;re going to get<br/>
a weighted blanket for ds. If you aren&#39;t familiar with them, the basic<br/>
issue is that they provide the sensory input that some children seek<br/>
for self-soothing. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325003275">Alison,<br/>
  My daughter (also 6) has SPD or SID, but has it much worse than your son.  She also has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome, and the diagnoses probably don&#39;t stop there.  We are seeing the Pediatric Neurologist on Monday, and will probably move onto the Child Phychiatrist from there.  Anyway, do you belong to any of the SPD or SID yahoo groups, because there are a number of them and they are very helpful.  Personally, I don&#39;t have much advice because Mariah does not hang on me constantly.  Sometimes I wish she would in public.  We seem to have the opposite problem.  Mariah is usually doing something very dangerous or very inappropriate in public.  If this is your only sensory issues, my guess is that it will probably work itself in time as your little guy gets a little more confident in the world.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899815170">I am a single mom to a 4 yr old ds with fairly major sensory issues <br/>
and a whole list of other labels. He likes to be attached as well. <br/>
His coping mechanism is stroking MY face, right around my lips, over <br/>
and over again. I am not a huge fan of being touched, especially in <br/>
this very sensitive area of my face. DS&#39;s touch can be very <br/>
aggressive, he seems to have trouble preceiving the level of his <br/>
touch, so he needs guidance with the level of touch as well. <br/>
<br/>
When he is really struggling he can require what seems likes hours of <br/>
touch. I felt obligated to meet his needs, but it was breeding <br/>
resentment in me, which in turn, caused ds more stress. Even when I <br/>
felt like i was meeting his needs, he did not seem content.<br/>
<br/>
So I talked to ds&#39;s occupational therapist. I have and am struggling <br/>
with addressing ds&#39;s needs, professional assistance, and my parenting <br/>
beliefs. I am fortunate that most of ds&#39;s therapists are pretty <br/>
respectful folks, and I currently believe that their assistance is <br/>
helpful, pleasant for ds, and legally necessary (I am going through a <br/>
custody battle as well). <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she suggusted meeting the need for some amount of time, no <br/>
discussion. Then at some point, say ten minutes or so, telling him <br/>
that I needed a break, discussing options, and helping him to engage <br/>
in another activity. If he is insistant that he must continue, then <br/>
to set a timelimit for another round, do so willingly, then when the <br/>
time is up, say &quot;ok time to xyz,and moving on to an engaging activity <br/>
(one that can meet the need that he seems to need - like jumping on <br/>
the trampoline, or a deep massage, or putting pillows on him and <br/>
laying on him). <br/>
<br/>
I thought she was crazy as she went through this with me - ds is very <br/>
paasionate to say the least and I felt pretty confidant that he would <br/>
end up exploding if I said no, but I realized that it was about not <br/>
saying no, but finding more mutually acceptable ways to cope. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it has worked. Since I know that it is not going to go on <br/>
forever, and I look at it as a learning experience about my child. My <br/>
child (I hope)knows that I am going to meet his needs. <br/>
<br/>
I am learning more about his limits and triggers and not taking him <br/>
to his edge, equiping him with the ability to voice his feelings and <br/>
needs, and actively problem solving with him to meet those needs.<br/>
<br/>
I have been pleasantly surprised by his ability to tell me what he <br/>
needs lately. Sometimes it is very raw, but he is now able to reach <br/>
out to me in the heat of his passion and ask for help -a huge his <br/>
step for him. He is also able to hear me and see that I am trying to <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to try the weighted vests, but I have experimented with <br/>
different textures and objects for ds to touch. Any substitutions <br/>
would just send him over the edge.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck. My ds also has an articulation disorder, a receptive <br/>
language disorder, pragmatic language disorder, and auditory <br/>
processing disorder, so language  can be a real challenge for us.<br/>
He is also considered to be globally developmentally delayed, with <br/>
planning difficulties, muscular incoridination and weakness, and <br/>
visual/spatial difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
As I am sure you know, this must make life so challenging for him. I <br/>
find it very challenging, especially as a single parent, but it <br/>
really does help to try and look at things from his point of view. I <br/>
find myself evualating new situations, looking for triggers, and then <br/>
trying to help ds navigate, with out &quot;crowding&quot; him, per se.<br/>
<br/>
Kepp your chin up, it sounds like ds is fortunate to have a dm who <br/>
cares so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-123779684">Thanks for your experiences, Woodhaven<br/>
<br/>
It helps to know I&#39;m not the only one dealing with it (I *know* that<br/>
already. But when you&#39;re in the middle of it all it seems like I&#39;m the<br/>
only one sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
I took DS to a hockey game tonight - just the two of us and we got to<br/>
talk a little. He was able to put some of his feelings and fears into<br/>
words and I have a little bit better understanding of what he&#39;s going<br/>
through. I was also able to give him alot of extra hugs and touching -<br/>
and then it hit me why sometimes I get so frustrated. It usually<br/>
happens when I have all three children with me. I&#39;m a little<br/>
flustered, just trying to keep everyone with me, fielding all their<br/>
comments, making sure nothing gets broken in the stores, trying to<br/>
remember why I&#39;m at the store, etc. And DS begins with all his extra<br/>
needs. I just can&#39;t deal with it given all the other stuff I&#39;m<br/>
thinking about at that time, so I think it wears on me quicker and<br/>
harder. But tonight, being alone with him, it was very different. he<br/>
was still the same with his needs - more so because it was SO crowded,<br/>
but I had no problem giving him the extras he needed. I was calm and<br/>
relaxed, not having all the extra thoughts of errands, kids, etc. <br/>
<br/>
So I came away from tonight with better insight, both on him and me. I<br/>
am going to have to brainstorm on how to make those situations better<br/>
for all of us...<br/>

I know I&#39;m really late getting back to you---very busy month or so.<br/>
<br/>
Really and truly---all these things that seem like SOOO much now will <br/>
not be so big in a few years.<br/>
<br/>
Take deep breaths as often as you can. He gets older every day.<br/>
<br/>
When he&#39;s 20, you&#39;ll miss this time and think back on it fondly. <br/>
Really, really, really!<br/>
